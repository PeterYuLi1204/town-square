Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, January 15, 2019 11
B. Motions on Notice
1. Ramping Up Vancouver’s Climate Action in Response to the Climate Emergency
MOVED by Councillor Boyle
SECONDED by Councillor Carr
WHEREAS
1. The British Columbia government declared a provincial state of emergency in
2018 over record-setting wildfires:
a. Wildfires in BC broke the record for km2 burned in 2018, surpassing the
record of 12,161 km2 and 65,000 forced from their homes in 2017;
b. Wildfires in California killed more than 100 people and caused over
$14.5 billion in insured losses in 2018;
2. The Legislature of British Columbia and the House of Commons of Canada
acknowledged the growing crisis of climate breakdown by holding emergency
debates following the release of the October 2018 IPCC report;
3. Local governments around the world are taking new actions to avoid the worst
impacts of climate breakdown and calling on senior levels of government for a
more urgent, emergency response;
4. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change finds that limiting global
warming to 1.5ºC with no or limited overshoot would imply global net CO
2
emissions dropping to between 50% and 58% below 2010 levels by 2030, and
between 94% and 107% below 2010 levels by 2050. Global net CO emissions
2
would need to continued to decline into the second half of the century reaching
negative net emissions in all scenarios;
5. The costs to Vancouver for dealing with sea level rise and storm water and sewer
management are significant:
a. Staff estimate that approximately $1 billion of flood management
infrastructure is needed in Vancouver by 2100. To operate and maintain
this infrastructure, the City will require additional staff and budget
estimated at $5 million a year;
b. Conservative estimates of the cost of a flood in Vancouver place the
value in property and building damage at approximately $7 billion. This
does not include the economic impact of business disruption or the cost
of clean-up and rebuilding;
c. Regionally, the Fraser Basin Council, a non-profit group that provides
regional flood planning support, estimates the potential cost of a major
coastal flood at $25 billion for the Lower Mainland.

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, January 15, 2019 12
6. The world is currently on track for more than 3ºC of warming based on policies
currently in place, and those policies will need to be strengthened significantly to
limit warming to 1.5ºC. Vancouver, BC, and Canada are no exceptions:
a. Vancouver’s carbon pollution levels are 7% below 2007 levels, which
represents an average reduction of less than 1% per year over the past
decade. An average annual reduction of over 3% is necessary to meet
the City’s 2030 targets;
b. BC’s carbon pollution has increased in four of the past five years and the
province eliminated its 2020 reduction target because it was on track to
miss it by a wide margin. On December 5, 2018, the province introduced
a new climate change plan, which is expected to put the province on track
for 75% of its 2030 target of 40% below 2007 levels;
c. Canada’s carbon pollution was down 4% from 2005 levels to 704 million
tonnes. Policies committed to in the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean
Growth and Climate Action are only forecast to bring emissions down to
583 million tonnes in 2030, failing to meet the national target of 517
million tonnes;
7. The City of Vancouver has been taking action on sustainability through its
Greenest City and Renewable City Action plans, setting a solid foundation for
ramping up ambition and action to meet the moral and scientific urgency of
climate change;
8. Past City of Vancouver staff reports acknowledge that “climate change shocks
and stresses do not affect all groups in our community equally. Frontline
communities, those that have been affected by systemic vulnerabilities and
inequities, are often at greater risk from the impacts of climate change and often
have the fewest resources to respond and adapt.”;
9. A growing list of cities, districts and counties across the world representing over
15 million people collectively have recently declared or officially acknowledged
the existence of a global climate emergency, including Los Angeles, Oakland,
and most recently London, England.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council recognize the breakdown of the stable climate and sea level
under which human civilization developed constitutes an emergency for the
City of Vancouver;
FURTHER THAT Council direct staff to report back within 90 days on
opportunities to:
i. increase ambition and/or accelerate timelines for existing actions
under the Renewable City Action Plan and Climate Adaptation
Strategy;
ii. add new actions to help the City achieve its targets;

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, January 15, 2019 13
iii. add new actions that would help reduce GHG emissions beyond
the scope of the City’s current climate targets; and
iv. Incorporate into the City’s climate targets and actions the need to
achieve net zero carbon emissions before 2050 and net negative
carbon emissions in the second half of the century.
B. THAT Council direct staff to establish a remaining carbon budget for corporate
and community emissions commensurate with limiting warming to 1.5ºC and
report annually on the expenditure of the City of Vancouver’s remaining carbon
budget;
C. THAT Council direct staff to establish a “Climate and Equity” working group to
provide guidance and support for the City’s efforts to transition off of fossil fuels
in ways the priorities those most vulnerable to climate impacts and most in need
of support in transitioning to renewable energy.

(Councillor Fry absent for the vote)
2. #AllOnBoard Campaign
MOVED by Councillor Swanson
SECONDED by Councillor De Genova
WHEREAS
1. The City of Vancouver has recognized and has demonstrated over the past years
its commitment to the health and well-being of its residents, and lack of
transportation is one of the most common reasons for missing medical
appointments and a significant barrier to social inclusion and labour market
inclusion for low income adults and youth;
2. The #AllOnBoard Campaign, concerned agencies in Vancouver and throughout
Metro Vancouver, and directly impacted youth and adult community members
have brought to the attention of the City of Vancouver the direct harm that is
brought to them through the bad credit ratings they develop due to fare evasion
ticketing. Those living below the poverty line have brought forward that they
cannot afford to pay the $173 fines received individually, or the resulting accrued
‘TransLink debt’ from many unpaid fines;

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, January 15, 2019 14
3. The City of Vancouver and other municipalities contribute to charities and
non-profits which then out of necessity subsidize transit tickets for those who
cannot afford to access crucial social services provided by the City of Vancouver
and other municipalities, and many pay off ‘TransLink debt’ and fare evasion
fines to TransLink and external collection agencies.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT
A. THAT the City of Vancouver endorse the #AllOnBoard Campaign; the City write a
letter to the TransLink Mayors’ Council on Regional Transportation, the Board of
Directors of TransLink, the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing and the
Ministry of Social Development and Poverty Reduction asking TransLink to work
with the provincial government to finalize and secure funding, and develop a plan
that will provide free public transit for minors (aged 0-18), and reduced price
transit based on a sliding scale using the Market Basket Measure for all
low-income people regardless of their demographic profile as soon as possible.
B. THAT the City write a separate letter to the Mayors’ Council on Regional
Transportation asking them to 1) require TransLink adopt a poverty
reduction/equity mandate in order to address the outstanding issue of lack of
affordability measures to ensure those who need public transit the most can
access the essential service, and 2) to request the Mayors’ Council on Regional
Transportation and TransLink immediately and without delay amend existing
by-laws and cease ticketing all minors for fare evasion as the first step towards
the full implementation of free transit for children and youth 0-18, unlink ICBC
from fare evasion for youth and adults, cease ticketing adults.
C. THAT the resolution regarding support for the #AllOnBoard Campaign be
forwarded for consideration at the 2019 Lower Mainland Local Government
Association (LMLGA) convention and subsequent Union of BC Municipalities
(UBCM) convention.
D. THAT the #AllOnBoard forthcoming research report containing evidence and
testimonies in support of the #AllOnBoard Campaign be included in the
submission to the Lower Mainland Local Government Association (LMLGA) once
available.

3. Deterring and Preventing Money Laundering and the Business of Organized Crime
in the City of Vancouver
MOVED by Councillor De Genova
SECONDED by Councillor Dominato
WHEREAS
1. The Attorney General commissioned Peter German’s report titled “Dirty Money:
An Independent Review of Money Laundering in Lower Mainland Casinos
conducted for the Attorney General of British Columbia”;
2. The media reported that Mr. German estimates over $100 million dollars has
been laundered in B.C.;
3. In Fall 2018, Attorney General David Eby and Minister of Finance Carole James,
announced the Expert Panel on Money Laundering will be reviewing British
Columbia’s real estate sector and offering solutions to prevent market
manipulation and money laundering. The panel consists of three members, who
offer experience and knowledge pertaining to government policy, real estate and
money laundering;
4. Page 16 of the Dirty Money Report, recommendation “R45” suggests “That the
Province undertake research into allegations of organized crime penetration of
the real estate industry”;
5. In “Dirty Money” Mr. German states “79. Part 2 overviews the phenomenon of
transnational organized crime and the unique position in which Vancouver finds
itself. It describes the ‘Vancouver Model’, which provides a very practical
framework for what has occurred in recent years. A primer is included on money
laundering”;
6. Mr. German also states in his report the most lucrative crimes in Vancouver are
related to illegal drug sales. The drugs of choice cover the spectrum, from natural
products such as cannabis, cocaine and heroin, to chemical creations such as
opioids and hallucinogens;
7. The City of Vancouver Empty Homes Tax (Vacancy Tax By-law No. 11674) was
implemented in 2017 by City Council, collecting 1% of the property’s assessed
taxable value if the property is left vacant. Currently, there is no system to
confirm if the money collected by the City is directly or indirectly linked to money
laundering.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT the Mayor write a letter on behalf of Council to the Attorney General of
British Columbia and affirm the City of Vancouver’s support to work with the B.C.
Provincial government and when appropriated, the Vancouver Police Department
and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and appropriate investigative teams to
prevent money laundering that could be directly or indirectly linked to businesses
operating with or without a business license in the City of Vancouver.

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, January 15, 2019 16
B. THAT Council direct staff to work with the Attorney General’s office, the Province
of B.C. and the appropriate police authorities to identify a system where the City
of Vancouver can share pertinent information with the appropriate authorities to
prevent and deter money laundering.
C. THAT Council direct staff to review the powers available in the Vancouver
Charter, including but not limited to:
i) The ability of the City of Vancouver to require voluntary stringent financial
reporting; including but not limited to requiring audited financial
statements, from businesses, individuals, corporations and companies
when paying specific taxes, business licensing or any type of fee charged
by the City of Vancouver in areas of business or property ownership that
are more likely to attract money laundering and/or organized crime;
ii) The ability of the City of Vancouver to share information related to
property ownership, and the collection of fees collected by the City of
Vancouver, with senior levels of government, and appropriate agencies,
including police agencies and specific investigative teams, in the interest
of preventing and deterring money laundering.
D. THAT staff report back to Council by the end of Q4 2019, including any
recommendations.

NEW BUSINESS
1. Putting the Lid on Clothing Donation Bins
MOVED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
SECONDED by Councillor De Genova
WHEREAS
1. Donation bins have traditionally been placed in various neighbourhoods and
locations throughout Vancouver to enable residents to donate used clothing to
various charities;

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, January 15, 2019 17
2. In recent years, tragic deaths occurred of people who sought shelter in or to
remove clothing from these bins. Most recently a 34-year old Vancouver resident
was found lodged in a Community Living Society donation bin in West Vancouver
on December 30, 2018, and pronounced dead. In July 2018 a woman perished in
Vancouver in a Development Disabilities Association bin located at West Point
Grey Community Centre. Since 2015, deaths also occurred in Pitt Meadows and
Surrey;
3. The City of Burnaby has banned clothing donation bins on City property as has
Surrey. The City of Richmond has imposed restrictions on clothing donation bins
on City property. West Vancouver immediately moved to seal clothing donation
bins on City and private property following the December 2018 death, and placed
metal straps on those bins;
4. Vancouver started requesting operators to remove donation bins on street
right-of-ways in September 2018 achieving approximately 90 per cent removal by
November 2018. However, they are still allowed and still found on private land,
as well as some City land locations such as firehalls. The City has stated it
intends to review the status of remaining bins on private lands this year. It is
purported there are still thousands of functional bins across Metro Vancouver;
5. Donation bins provide benefit for various charities and a means of diverting used
clothing from land-fills;
6. Inclusion BC announced it is shutting down all its bins across the Province of BC
on behalf of its 15 community group participants until they might be replaced or
modifications made to ensure they are safe. Other charities such as Big Brothers
are also removing bins pending identification of safe options;
7. The annual volume of textile waste and disposal per person is becoming an
increasing issue. The City of Vancouver is committed to enabling opportunities
for waste reduction and recycling;
8. While first and foremost this is a life safety issue stemming from prevalent
poverty and homelessness, current bin designs are also causing a proliferation of
refuse and garbage at bin sites across the city and sparking increasing resident
concern;
9. A newly released January 2019 Research Co. online survey indicates that 70%
of British Columbians and 76% of Lower Mainland residents agree with banning
all clothing donations bins in their municipality. Additionally, 73% of BC residents
as well as Lower Mainland residents say they would have no problem taking
clothes to a specific facility for donation instead of relying on bins. The study
further found that all demographic groups in British Columbia are voicing support
for the elimination of donation bins;
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to immediately remove all remaining bins on City
property in the interest of public safety until such time as they can be replaced,
retrofitted or made safe, with consideration given to bin designs that also avoid
strewing of refuse.

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, January 15, 2019 18
B. THAT Council direct staff to immediately encourage and request the removal or
sealing of any remaining donation bins located on private property in the City of
Vancouver in the interest of public safety within the City’s legal ability to do so
until they can be replaced, retrofitted or made safe, with consideration given to
bin designs that also avoid strewing of refuse.
FURTHER THAT, if necessary, Council direct staff to pursue necessary and
lawful actions to require and ensure expedited removal of any remaining bins on
private land that staff deem to be a high risk for life and safety issues.
C. THAT Council direct staff to report back on options at the City’s disposal such as
but not limited to by-law changes to prohibit donations bins on private land.
D. THAT staff explore opportunities to consider usage or permitting of new safe
designs that may come from industry, non-profit or academic initiatives such as,
but not limited to, the UBC Okanagan School of Engineering donation bin design
initiative, recognizing that such bins do provide a valuable source of fundraising
for charitable and non-profit organizations.
E. THAT staff explore and report back on the opportunity for centralized drop-off of
clothing or small household items for residents in partnership with charitable and
non-profit organizations currently involved in collection of these items.
F. THAT staff explore and report back on the opportunity, in partnership with
charitable and non-profit organizations, for a pilot project for the placement of
safe bins in strata and multi-unit residential buildings.
G. THAT staff explore and report back on the opportunity for recycling and
disaggregation of textiles as part of the Zero Waste 2040 strategy.
H. THAT the Mayor write to Metro Vancouver on behalf of Council to request that
Metro Vancouver encourage its member municipalities to also remove or seal
their unsafe donation bins.
I. THAT the Mayor bring forward a resolution to the 2019 Lower Mainland Local
Government Management Association of BC and 2019 Union of BC
Municipalities conferences requesting support for a ban on donation bins until
safe alternatives are available.
