above-noted motion to the Regular Council meeting following the Standing Committee on Policy
and Strategic Priorities meeting to be held on May 15, 2019, as Unfinished Business.
Subsequently, the motion was referred to the Standing Committee on Policy and Strategic
Priorities meeting on June 12, 2019, to hear from speakers, with a start time of 3pm.
The Committee heard from four speakers in support of the motion.

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, June 12 and 19, 2019 12
MOVED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. MLA Jane Thornthwaite submitted a private bill titled the Welfare Payment
System Reflection Act calling upon the Province of BC to change the practice for
distribution of social assistance cheques.
2. The bill asks the Province of British Columbia to call upon the Minister
responsible for the processing of income assistance to prepare a report on
alternatives in payment processing to individuals receiving assistance, and states
the report must consider but is not limited to considering the following:
(a) Providing welfare, disability assistance or other income assistance in
multiple payments throughout a month as opposed to single monthly
payment; and
(b) Alternative payment systems that enable responsible spending of
assistance.
3. The bill indicates that the Ministers conducting this consultation must consult
with, but are not limited to consulting with, individuals receiving welfare, disability
assistance or other income assistance, groups advocating for those receiving
welfare, disability assistance or other income assistance, and the Union of BC
Municipalities.
4. In April 2016 the Province of BC declared the increase in overdose deaths a
public health emergency. Vancouver has been at the center of this crisis.
Fentanyl-detected overdose deaths were 152 in 2016, 306 in 2017 and 337 in
2018. BC Coroners confirmed Vancouver overdose deaths were 232 in 2016,
376 in 2017 and 387 in 2018. In conjunction with the overdose health
emergency, the practice of distributing social assistance cheques on the same
day/s creates acute service demand peaks for first responders, putting a strain
on first responder and City staff resources that can exceed capacity to deal with
incidents. This has created increasing job and emotional stress on our first
responders
5. Medical health experts and first responders know there is a significant spike in
drug-related deaths within days of people receiving their social assistance
cheques. On average, overdose deaths can be 40% higher during income
assistance payment week according to the BC Coroners Service report on Illicit
Drug Overdose Deaths in BC (2009-2019).
6. Vancouver averaged about 22 overdose calls a day to B.C. paramedics in 2017
and has averaged about 20 calls a day in 2018 according to BC Emergency
Health Services. Insite once averaged a couple of overdoses a day but in 2018
saw closer to seven a day after the fentanyl crisis took hold, and recorded 16
overdoses on a cheque day and 11 the following day.

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, June 12 and 19, 2019 13
7. The call to change the current cheque day distribution practice has been
endorsed by Vancouver Fire and Rescue Services.
8. In December 2018, Council unanimously adopted the Mayor’s Overdose
Emergency Task Force - Recommendations for Immediate Action on the
Overdose Crisis recognizing it will take concerted efforts to change the course of
the crisis. The report included calling for collective action for systemic changes.
9. Dr. Lindsey Richardson, Research Scientist at BC Centre on Substance Use and
Associate Professor, Sociology at the University of BC, was the principal
investigator leading a study on the impact of alternative social assistance
disbursement on drug-related harm or TASA ‘cheque day’ study. Initiated in
2012, the study recognized that synchronized payments have been linked to
escalations in drug use and unintended but severe drug-related harms, including
overdose, as well as spikes in demand for health, social, financial and first
responder services.
10. Vancouver needs continued concrete action on prevention, treatment and
recovery options for mental health and addictions to turn the tide on the number
of deaths. Changing and varying cheque schedules may be one small brick in a
bigger wall that could break down the social phenomenon of a one approach
distribution practice. Further, change will help alleviate the strain on overdose
services, and the significant physical and emotional toll on our first responders,
city staff and support organizations.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council endorse the Welfare Payment System Reflection Act bill for the
Province of BC to consider alternatives in payment processing to individuals
receiving welfare, disability or other income assistance.
B. THAT the Mayor, on behalf of Council, write to the Premier, Minister of Social
Development and Poverty Reduction as well as the Minister for Mental Health
and Addictions, stating Council’s endorsement and encouragement to consider
alternative cheque day distribution practices.
C. THAT the Mayor, on behalf of Council, write to the Union of BC Municipalities
(UBCM) stating Council’s endorsement and encouraging them to ask member
municipalities to endorse the call for the Province of BC to consider alternatives
in payment processing to individuals receiving welfare, disability or other income
assistance.
amended
AMENDMENT MOVED by Councillor Swanson
THAT the following be added at the end:
THAT the Mayor on behalf of Council write again to the Province of BC asking for
assistance rates to be raised to the market basket poverty line and for a safe
supply of drugs.

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, June 12 and 19, 2019 14
THAT whatever change is made in cheque distribution, people on assistance be
asked to choose what type of cheque distribution system they would like.
CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY (Vote No. 04577)
AMENDMENT MOVED by Councillor Fry
THAT A be amended by deleting the word “endorse” and replacing it with “express
support for the intent of”;
FURTHER THAT B be amended by deleting the phrase “endorsement and

2018. BC Coroners confirmed Vancouver overdose deaths were 232 in 2016,
376 in 2017 and 387 in 2018. In conjunction with the overdose health
emergency, the practice of distributing social assistance cheques on the same
day/s creates acute service demand peaks for first responders, putting a strain
on first responder and City staff resources that can exceed capacity to deal with
incidents. This has created increasing job and emotional stress on our first
responders.
5. Medical health experts and first responders know there is a significant spike in
drug-related deaths within days of people receiving their social assistance
cheques. On average, overdose deaths can be 40% higher during income
assistance payment week according to the BC Coroners Service report on Illicit
Drug Overdose Deaths in BC (2009-2019).
6. Vancouver averaged about 22 overdose calls a day to B.C. paramedics in 2017
and has averaged about 20 calls a day in 2018 according to BC Emergency
Health Services. Insite once averaged a couple of overdoses a day but in 2018
saw closer to seven a day after the fentanyl crisis took hold, and recorded 16
overdoses on a cheque day and 11 the following day.
7. The call to change the current cheque day distribution practice has been
endorsed by Vancouver Fire and Rescue Services.
8. In December 2018, Council unanimously adopted the Mayor’s Overdose
Emergency Task Force - Recommendations for Immediate Action on the
Overdose Crisis recognizing it will take concerted efforts to change the course of
the crisis. The report included calling for collective action for systemic changes.
9. Dr. Lindsey Richardson, Research Scientist at BC Centre on Substance Use and
Associate Professor, Sociology at the University of BC, was the principal
investigator leading a study on the impact of alternative social assistance
disbursement on drug-related harm or TASA ‘cheque day’ study. Initiated in
2012, the study recognized that synchronized payments have been linked to
escalations in drug use and unintended but severe drug-related harms, including
overdose, as well as spikes in demand for health, social, financial and first
responder services.
10. Vancouver needs continued concrete action on prevention, treatment and
recovery options for mental health and addictions to turn the tide on the number
of deaths. Changing and varying cheque schedules may be one small brick in a
bigger wall that could break down the social phenomenon of a one approach
distribution practice. Further, change will help alleviate the strain on overdose
services, and the significant physical and emotional toll on our first responders,
city staff and support organizations.

5. Protecting Rental Housing Stock along Arterial Streets
At the Regular Council meeting on May 28, 2019, Council referred the above-noted motion to
the Standing Committee on Policy and Strategic Priorities meeting on June 12, 2019, to hear
from speakers, with a start time of 3 pm.
The Committee heard from 14 speakers in support of the motion and four speakers opposed to
the motion.
On June 12, 2019, at 8:40 pm Councillor De Genova rose on a Point of Order and stated that
Councillor Swanson asked a question to a speaker that mischaracterized a previous speaker’s
comments. The Chair reminded Councillors that the purpose of questions to speakers is for
clarification to the current speaker’s comments and not to make comments on previous
speaker’s comments.
MOVED by Councillor Swanson
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. The City of Vancouver has a Rental Housing Stock Official Development Plan
(ODP) that was most recently updated in June 2018.
2. The Rental Housing Stock ODP states that:
Council has concerns about preserving the existing rental housing stock because
it continues to be some of the most affordable and secure rental housing in the
city, compared to the relatively high rents of newly-constructed rental housing. In
Vancouver, the existing stock of low-rise, wood-frame market rental buildings,
largely constructed before 1980, makes up over 80 per cent of the city’s purpose-
built rental housing stock and has rents that are nearly 30 per cent lower than
newly-constructed rental housing. Located in the zoning districts, which are some
of the city’s most desirable neighborhoods, this stock has come under
redevelopment pressure in recent years, driven by housing price growth and
development opportunities. The key to preserving this affordability requires
policies and programs that aim to protect and renew the city’s rental stock.
3. The Rental Housing Stock ODP requires one to one replacement of existing
rental units in some zones, but neglects to include the C-2 zones that currently
have significant numbers of existing rentals that are increasingly coming under
redevelopment pressure.
4. Staff is not currently considering expanding the Rental Housing Stock ODP in
their work plan and we could lose numerous units of rental housing if we wait too
long.
5. We need to reduce land speculation along arterials as the City Plan process
takes place.

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, June 12 and 19, 2019 18
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT
A. THAT Council instruct staff to prepare a by-law that amends the Rental Housing
Stock Official Development Plan (ODP) to add C-2 zones in the definition of
zoning districts in section 1.1 and bring it forward for Public Hearing within four
weeks of approval of this motion;
FURTHER THAT if, after a Public Hearing, such amending by-law is enacted,
Council treat this as an interim change to be revisited upon completion of the
City-wide plan.
B. THAT Council direct staff to, in the meantime, investigate alternatives for best
preserving rental housing stock in C-2, C-3A, and all RT zones, and to report
back as soon as possible.
The City Manager shared concerns from Legal Services regarding Item 5 and noted that those
concerns were relayed to the author of the motion.
REFERRAL MOVED by Councillor De Genova
THAT the Committee refer the motion “Protecting Rental Housing Stock Along Arterial
Streets” to staff and that staff consider the opportunities to protect rental in C-2 zones
and report back to council with recommendations, including innovative solutions to
protect existing rental and build new, affordable rental housing in C-2 zones.

6. Reducing Truck Pollution in Clark-Knight Corridor and Other City Streets
At the Regular Council meeting on May 28, 2019, Council referred the above-noted motion to
the Standing Committee on Policy and Strategic Priorities meeting on June 12, 2019, to hear
from speakers, with a start time of 3pm.
The Committee heard from five speakers in support of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Swanson
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. Homes, schools and businesses lining Vancouver’s Clark-Knight Corridor are
exposed to as much or more traffic pollution than neighbourhoods closest to
North America’s busiest highway, the 401 north of Toronto, according to a July
2018 study by University of Toronto professors in collaboration with Environment
and Climate Change Canada, the Ontario Ministry of Environment, Conservation
and Parks, and Metro Vancouver.
2. The researchers put the blame for the high levels of traffic pollution along the
Clark-Knight Corridor, which has 10 times less traffic than the 401, on the high
number of older, heavy-duty diesel trucks travelling back and forth to the Port of
Vancouver.
3. Exposure to high levels of traffic pollution is linked to increased risk of residents
and workers developing respiratory diseases, such as asthma and heart disease,
according to Health Canada. Of particular danger is soot, which is indicative of
diesel exhaust, a carcinogen associated with lung cancer.
4. The study’s authors warned that elevated levels of traffic pollution can be
detected as far as 250 metres from major roads, putting millions across the
country and thousands living in Vancouver at risk of suffering serious health
issues from living on or near major roads.
5. A 2017 study by a professor at UBC’s School of Population and Public Health
found Canada ranked third the highest rate per 100,000 of new cases of
childhood asthma with traffic pollution responsible for about 20% of the cases,
indicating that Metro Vancouver guidelines for pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide
may not be strong enough to prevent disease.
6. In 2017, the Clark Drive air quality monitoring station was the only one in Metro
Vancouver that failed to meet the region’s standards to limit nitrogen dioxide
emissions.

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, June 12 and 19, 2019 21
7. Vancouver’s high housing costs and low vacancy rates mean that it’s the
residents with the lowest incomes, especially families with children and seniors,
who end up living near the Clark-Knight Corridor, putting them at risk of serious
health consequences.
8. The City of Vancouver’s planning and zoning policies as well as the cost of land
have historically favoured putting social housing, multi-family projects,
purpose-built rentals and now modular housing along arterial routes, exposing
exponentially more people to the hazards of traffic pollution.
9. Environment and Climate Change Canada plans to step up air-quality monitoring
across the country; the BC Government is developing initiatives to cut
greenhouse gas emissions, including new standards for fuels and incentive
programs to upgrade emission controls for older diesel trucks; and, the Port of
Vancouver, TransLink and the trucking industry are investigating cleaner,
alternative fuel options for heavy trucks.
10. The City of Vancouver is participating in C40 Cities Climate Change Leadership
Group initiatives, including its Freight Academy, to tackle these issues while
developing the City’s Climate Emergency Response; and is committed to
transitioning to 100 % renewal energy before 2050.
11. New buildings along major roads in the city now include mechanisms to reduce
noise and air pollution on balconies and outdoor courtyards.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council request that the Mayor and Vancouver’s Metro Vancouver
delegates to:
1) Seek an update from Metro Vancouver on progress made on its Air
Quality and Climate Change Plan; and
2) Initiate actions to strengthen the region’s guidelines for permitted
pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide.
B. THAT Council direct staff to investigate the status of actions the Port of
Vancouver, the BC Government, TransLink, Transport Canada and the trucking
industry are considering to develop fuel options that reduce emissions from
heavy trucks using the Clark-Knight Corridor and other heavy truck routes and
report back what actions Council can take to ensure speedy implementation.
C. THAT Council direct staff to support Council-led motions to be submitted to the
next Union of BC Municipalities and the Federation of Canadian Municipalities
meetings to seek support for significant strengthening of provincial and federal
regulations restricting traffic pollution, particularly of the particulates (soot)
emitted by heavy trucks as well as requiring fuel alternatives that significantly
reduce pollution on major roads.
D. THAT Council direct staff, as part of the city wide planning process, to examine
the City’s zoning, building codes, and planning policies and practices, such as

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, June 12 and 19, 2019 22
prioritizing placement of multi-family buildings on arterials, to determine that the
same standards of health and safety are applied equally to all residents.
F. THAT Council direct staff to investigate methods to protect future housing
developments on the Clark-Knight Corridor and other major truck routes until the
City can ensure that the health of residents will not be unduly compromised.
F. THAT Council direct staff to seek recommendations from Vancouver Coastal
Health and Metro Vancouver for measures residents of existing housing can take
to best mitigate the impact of traffic pollution such as improved air filters, sound
proofing, air purifiers, that might help existing residents mitigate the impact of
traffic pollution, including fully informing residents of the dangers of eating garden
produce, leaving windows open.
G. THAT Council direct staff to inform the Vancouver School Board (VSB) of these
actions and work with the VSB determine the impact of ever-increasing traffic
pollution on the three elementary schools most directly affected (Fleming, Queen
Alexandra and McBride).

MOVED by Councillor Fry
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. Sikhism is a religion that originated during the 15th century in the Punjab region
of India. Today, over 150,000 Metro Vancouverites identify as Sikh.
2. The first wave of Sikh immigration to Vancouver occurred in 1904. Despite many
historic injustices and institutionalized racism, in 1947 Sikhs were given the right
to vote and become Canadian citizens.
3. The Punjabi Market is a 3-block commercial district along Main Street between
48th and 51st avenues that has been a destination for South Asian culture and

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, June 12 and 19, 2019 27
commerce since Sucha Singh Claire opened a sari and fabric shop in the area on
May 31, 1970.
4. The Punjabi Market, also known as Little India was the first and largest South
Asian Market outside of South Asia and has historically included several Indian
restaurants, sweet shops, jewellery stores, clothing stores, grocers, as well as
other businesses catering to the South Asian community, local neighbourhood
and tourists.
5. Vancouver was home to the first and largest Vaisakhi celebration outside of
Punjab, traveling between Ross Street Temple and Punjabi Market, at its height,
there were over 300 shops in the area. Punjabi Market was the first place in the
world (outside of South Asia) to have Punjabi on street signs.
6. In recent years, the Punjabi Market has been struggling, and new construction
and residential development has the potential to transform the area. Community
concerns with regard to public realm, street level retail, and built form called for
more comprehensive and collaborative planning for the future of Punjabi Market.
7. In 2016, responding to community concerns, Vancouver City Council directed
staff to examine Chapter 23 of the Sunset Community Vision – “Main Street
Shopping Area/Punjabi Market” and noted “a robust plan needs to be in place to
preserve and sustain Punjabi Market for future generations.”
8. In 2017 the City commissioned Retail Business Study of the Punjabi Market Area
of Vancouver (LOCO BC, Masala) which was delivered in March 2018.
9. In April 2018, staff proposed an Area Management Plan that would include the
creation of an area Statement of Significance (including heritage values and key
character defining elements) along with a local working group and strategies and
actions for regeneration of Punjabi Market.
10. In November 2018, Vancouver City Council directed staff to expedite the
development of a City-wide planning process, that would help to determine the
shape of our neighbourhoods, guided by inclusion, heritage, and enjoyable
well-designed gathering places, among other things.
11. The health and vitality of Vancouver's communities is one of the reasons the city
is considered one of the best places on earth to live. City staff routinely advise
Council on polices, strategies, and initiatives that meet the needs of Vancouver's
multicultural and diverse communities.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT
A. THAT Council affirms that the Punjabi Market shopping area is an area with
historic significance and present day importance.
B. THAT the Mayor determine May 31, 2020, and the occasion of its 50th
Anniversary as “Punjabi Market Day”.

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, June 12 and 19, 2019 28

Q4 2019.
D. THAT Council direct staff, including Engineering, Arts Culture and Community
Services, and Planning to consult with community and identify quick-wins along
with necessary budget, resources and potential partnerships to deploy in
advance of the occasion of the 50th Anniversary, including but not limited to
public realm improvements, and report back by Q4 2019.
E. THAT Council direct staff to report back by Q4 2019, with budget and resources

2. The South Asian community in Vancouver is diverse in terms of its religions,
ethnicities, identities and languages; and is growing. The South Asian community
is the second largest visible minority group in the city and (according to Stats
Canada and Census data) will make up the largest visible minority group in
Canada within the next two decades.
3. The Punjabi Market is a 3-block commercial district along Main Street between
48th and 51st avenues that has been a destination for South Asian culture and
commerce since Sucha Singh Claire opened a sari and fabric shop in the area on
May 31, 1970.
4. The Punjabi Market, also known as Little India was the first and largest South
Asian Market outside of South Asia and has historically included several Indian
restaurants, sweet shops, jewellery stores, clothing stores, grocers, as well as
other businesses catering to the South Asian community, local neighbourhood
and tourists.
5. Vancouver was home to the first and largest Vaisakhi celebration outside of
Punjab, traveling between Ross Street Temple and Punjabi Market, at its height,
there were over 300 shops in the area. Punjabi Market was the first place in the
world (outside of South Asia) to have Punjabi on street signs.
6. In recent years, the Punjabi Market has been struggling, and new construction
and residential development has the potential to transform the area. Community
concerns with regard to public realm, street level retail, and built form called for
more comprehensive and collaborative planning for the future of Punjabi Market.
7. In 2016, responding to community concerns, Vancouver City Council directed
staff to examine Chapter 23 of the Sunset Community Vision – “Main Street
Shopping Area/Punjabi Market” and noted “a robust plan needs to be in place to
preserve and sustain Punjabi Market for future generations.”
8. In 2017 the City commissioned Retail Business Study of the Punjabi Market Area
of Vancouver (LOCO BC, Masala) which was delivered in March 2018.
9. In April 2018, staff proposed an Area Management Plan that would include the
creation of an area Statement of Significance (including heritage values and key
character defining elements) along with a local working group and strategies and
actions for regeneration of Punjabi Market.
10. In November 2018, Vancouver City Council directed staff to expedite the
development of a City-wide planning process, that would help to determine the
shape of our neighbourhoods, guided by inclusion, heritage, and enjoyable
well-designed gathering places, among other things.
11. The health and vitality of Vancouver's communities is one of the reasons the city
is considered one of the best places on earth to live. City staff routinely advise
Council on polices, strategies, and initiatives that meet the needs of Vancouver's
multicultural and diverse communities.

THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council affirms that the Punjabi Market shopping area is an area with
historic significance and present day importance.
B. THAT the Mayor determine May 31, 2020, and the occasion of its 50th
Anniversary as “Punjabi Market Day”.
C. THAT Council direct staff to review work to date, including the Sunset

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, June 12 and 19, 2019 33
MOVED by Councillor Fry
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. More than half of the population of the City of Vancouver rent their home;
2. Rents are high and vacancy rates are low, which has been characterized as a
crisis;
3. The City of Vancouver has committed to a target of 20,000 new purpose-built
rental units to be approved by 2027;
4. Developer Cost Levies (DCLs) are an important source of revenue for City
facilities like Parks, Childcare facilities, Social and non-profit housing, and
Engineering infrastructure;
5. The City of Vancouver waives Developer Cost Levies (DCLs) to encourage the
construction of purpose-built rental through the Moderate Income Rental Housing
Pilot Program, and for “For Profit Affordable Housing” through the Rental 100
program;
6. Rents under Rental 100 typically exceed the measure of affordability for the
median Vancouver household income (less than $80,000);
7. Hotel and traveler accommodations support one of Vancouver and the region’s
primary industries. In 2017, tourism contributed approximately $4.8 billion to the
Metro Vancouver economy and supported over 70,000 full time jobs;
8. For the last 15 years, the number of Vancouver hotel rooms have been in
decline. The loss of hotel supply has put upward pressure on the market and the
average costs of the remaining hotel stock are consistently among the highest in
Canada;
9. Tourism Vancouver warned the City risks losing its competitive edge as a tourism
destination over hotel room shortages; potentially over $2 billion in visitor
spending over 12 years (Tourism in Vancouver: Hotel Demand, Supply and
Impact - 12 April, 2019);
10. Tourism Vancouver have undergone 2030 planning, and have recommended
that between 3,000 - 4,000 hotel rooms are required to meet visitor demand;
11. Modern traveler preferences for Do-it-yourself (DIY) apartment-style
accommodations have led to growth in individually-owned peer-to-peer (P2P)
“short term rentals” (STRs) like Airbnb and VRBO; variously marketed under the
slogan “live like a local.”;
12. P2P STRs like Airbnb and VRBO can replace long-term local (resident) rental
housing supply with short-term visitor accommodations. Despite regulations,
anecdotal reports and self-appointed watchdogs suggest P2P STRs are a threat

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, June 12 and 19, 2019 34
to long-term rental stock;
13. Modern traveler preferences for Do-it-yourself (DIY) apartment-style
accommodations are also inspiring the growth of “tech-enabled hospitality”
options in the new form of corporate-run apartment-hotel hybrids like Stay Alfred,
Lyric, and Sonder;
14. The tech-enabled hospitality model avails:
a. Locations in purpose-built rental, strata, or commercial buildings;
b. Forgoing lobby, concierge, and otherwise traditional hotel amenities;
c. Opportunities to “live like a local,” with locations potentially inside or outside
of traditional hotel districts;
d. An alternative to P2P STRs for the DIY traveler;
e. A discrete experience that is minimally impactful on long term local residents
and neighbourhoods: Suites and floors are accessed by coded key fob, apps
link guests to services operated out of remote locations, and sound monitors
support good neighbour agreements;
15. The tech-enabled hospitality model can also avail:
a. A financial incentive for developers to build new Purpose-Built Rental
leveraging a time-limited master lease for a portion of hospitality use in the
building.
b. The increased supply of new market rental, supported by tech-enabled
hospitality units in new Purpose-Built Rental (PBR) buildings;
c. The increased supply of new market rental, once the tech-enabled hospitality
units themselves are released from their lease;
16. The Canadian company Sonder (named in Forbes as one of 2018’s Next Billion
Dollar Startups) have undertaken master leases for entire floors of units in new
purpose-built apartment buildings, and helping to build new PBR buildings. For
example, in Central Philadelphia, Sonder have committed to master leases on
hundreds of units in planned buildings which in turn has provided developers with
financial security to build;
17. Members of the development community have expressed interest in this model
and tech-enabled hospitality providers have expressed interest in the Vancouver
market, but the city lacks a comprehensive policy, so the barrier to entry is too
high.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to explore new forms of hospitality and housing tenure
with development and construction industry, tech-enabled hospitality operators,
and lenders including CMHC.
B. THAT Council direct staff to consider how limited term master leases for tech-
enabled hospitality might function with regard to covenants, change of use, split
classification tax, licensing, legal, zoning, and city-wide planning.

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, June 12 and 19, 2019 35
C. THAT Council direct staff to consider in their July 2019 report on Rental Incentive
Program Review if tech-enabled hospitality models in lieu of DCL waivers might
improve the financial performance and delivery of for-profit purpose built rentals.
D. THAT Council direct staff to include in their July 2019 report on Rental Incentive
Program Review any budget and resource considerations.
E. THAT Council direct staff to include in their Winter 2019 report back on Rental
100, how incentive (specifically tech-enabled hospitality models) options other
than DCL waivers that might improve financial performance and delivery of for-
profit purpose built rentals.

9. A Comprehensive Strategy for Realizing the Full Potential of the Nighttime
Economy in the City of Vancouver
At the Regular Council meeting on June 11, 2019, Council referred the following motion to the
Standing Committee on Policy and Strategic Priorities meeting on June 12, 2019, to hear from
speakers, with a start time of 3pm.
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. The City of Vancouver’s mission is to create a great city of communities that
cares about its people, its environment, and the opportunities to live, work, and
prosper;
2. Vancouver City Council recognizes that a resilient, diverse economy fosters
dynamic businesses and sustainable employment, and helps to attract and retain
professionals, families, and individuals who can live and work in our city;
3. The City of Vancouver has an Economic Action Strategy (2011), supported by
Council, as well various initiatives that have been undertaken to promote and
strengthen local business, to provide tools for Vancouver businesses to flourish
(while incorporating sustainable practices), and to make Vancouver an attractive
business locale and tourism destination for people from around the world;
4. The Vancouver Economic Commission (VEC), as the economic development
agency for the City of Vancouver, works to strengthen Vancouver’s economy by
supporting local companies, attracting high-impact investment, and promoting
international trade, with a particular focus on developing Vancouver’s creative
economy, knowledge economy, and green economy;
5. The City of Vancouver has embarked on a wide range of strategic initiatives, for
example, the Music Strategy and Creative City Strategy which each seek to
develop a comprehensive plan and vision for culture and creativity in Vancouver;

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, June 12 and 19, 2019 36
6. The City of Vancouver has a Healthy City Strategy that, among other goals and
objectives, recognizes that a thriving, diverse economy, with opportunity for
everyone, is the foundation of a liveable city, as well as recognizing that families
with children are key to a diverse and vibrant society;
7. In recent years, cities around the world have begun to pay greater attention to
the value and potential of the Nighttime Economy of their cities, whether it be the
whole of a city’s nightlife industry of dining and entertainment, various major
nightlife components such as music and craft beverages, or secondary economic
activity from transportation and related nightlife spending by patrons;
8. A recent study undertaken by the City of Toronto concluded that the Nighttime
economy is the “new competitive edge for post-industrial cities” and that Toronto
should undertake a vision and action plan to advance the night-time economy;
9. To underscore the value of the Nighttime Economy to the city of Vancouver and
the Metro Vancouver region, the Hospitality Vancouver Association (HVA), an
association that advocates for clubs, pubs, and other businesses along Granville
Street and the Davie Village, notes that the Granville Entertainment District
(GED) – as the social hub of Vancouver – employs thousands of people and
generates tens of millions of dollars in annual economic activity, including more
than 900 jobs and $43.5 million in annual revenue alone generated by the GED’s
14 liquor-primary businesses;
10. A June 2018 study of Vancouver’s “Music Ecosystem” commissioned by the
Music BC Industry Association, outlines several specific impediments to a
thriving Nighttime Economy, as faced by the city’s music sector, such as
“obstacles with permits and curfews in high-activity areas” which has led to a
paucity of music events, as well as “limited late transport options” available for
music audiences in the city.”;
11. There is a general shortage of family-friendly, substance-free Nighttime Economy
options and events in the city that are suitable for children, youth, and families,
and despite the City’s support for many aspects of the Nighttime Economy,
Vancouver has gained a reputation for being a “no fun” city in the minds of many;
12. Attracting greater numbers of people to a downtown social district can yield
greater nightlife vibrancy and economic growth, as noted by the International
City/County Management Association (ICMA), but it can also place demands on
public safety and other municipal resources and therefore requires a strong
foundation and a dedicated, comprehensive focus on the part of local
governments and other government levels to capitalize on the economic
opportunities;
13. At the May 2, 2018, meeting of the Standing Committee of Council on City
Finance and Services, Vancouver City Council supported a series of nightlife
actions and recommendations stemming from a staff report entitled “Update on
Liquor Policy Implementation and Upgrading the Granville Entertainment
District”. These included an amendment directing staff, as part of the City’s
Creative City Strategy, to establish a “Nightlife Council” that combines safety,

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, June 12 and 19, 2019 37
security, transportation, economic development, and vibrant street life, as well as
integrating lessons learned from the Granville Entertainment District Safety and
Security Working Group;
14. Vancouver City Staff, in collaboration with students from Simon Fraser University
and input from the VEC, recently commissioned a literature review and
jurisdictional scan of Vancouver’s nightlife economy, identifying the key themes
of transportation, safety, access, and nightlife development, while acknowledging
that the scope of the project was limited to nightlife, and not to the broader
Nighttime economy, with recommendations for further investigation of the city’s
night economy;
15. The Nighttime Economy is more than just entertainment, leisure, and social
events, it encompasses cultural, retail, tourism, and various corporate sectors, as
well as nighttime workers who do not work in nightlife venues (e.g., health care
workers, first responders, and police);
16. At the July 26, 2018, Public Meeting of the Mayors’ Council on Regional
Transportation, TransLink staff reported on the NightBus service, including
discussion of TransLink’s engagement with the Province on ride-hailing, and
TransLink’s interest in partnering with ride-hailing services – particularly for first
mile/last mile and late night services;
17. TransLink – at the recommendation of its Late Night Stakeholder Committee –
recently piloted the NightBus service from a central hub located on West Georgia
Street at Granville, where patrons can wait comfortably in a central, well-lit
environment to help improve safety along the busy GED nightlife corridor, amid
frequent calls for extended SkyTrain service hours and ride-hailing options;
18. In June of this year, TransLink will be releasing a report on late night
transportation that will look at a range of seamless transit options for Metro
Vancouver residents to return safely to their communities;
19. Ride-hailing has yet to become legal in British Columbia, and despite legislation
introduced by the provincial government on November 19, 2018, that will
ostensibly allow ride-hailing companies to enter the B.C. market in the fall of
2019, it remains to be seen how, when, where, and if ride-hailing will arrive and
whether it can thrive and succeed in B.C.;
20. Cities such as Sydney and London have adopted night-time strategic plans, while
other cities have created dedicated commissions and staff and global cities
around the world are generally adopting strategic measures to grow their
Nighttime economies to create local jobs and support a wide range of economic
activity;
21. Despite the City of Vancouver’s ongoing interest (past and present) in developing
the potential of the city’s Nighttime Economy, obstacles and impediments
continue to exist, not the least of which relate to transportation, public safety,
access, and regulatory restrictions, and the City lacks a comprehensive

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, June 12 and 19, 2019 38
overarching strategic policy framework that could bring the fullness of the city’s
Nighttime Economy into focus.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT the current Vancouver City Council – sworn in on November 5, 2018 –
affirm its unequivocal support for realizing the full economic potential of a
Nighttime Economy and the role it can and does play in a strong, diverse local
economy, one that supports small businesses and jobs, the local arts and culture
sectors, and the goal for Vancouver to be a sustainable, liveable city with
opportunities for everyone.
B. THAT Vancouver City Council direct staff to work with the Vancouver Economic
Commission to develop recommendations for a comprehensive citywide
Nighttime Economy Strategy, one that encompasses all aspects of the Nighttime
Economy and serves to focus the range of necessary actions required by Council
and the City to remove obstacles and impediments to realizing the economic and
other potentials of Vancouver’s Nighttime Economy, in consultation with all
appropriate stakeholders, with work to begin in 2020, and for a draft strategy to
be presented to Council for its consideration on or before June 2021; and
FURTHER THAT Vancouver City Council direct staff to apply a child, youth, and
families’ lens in formulating recommendations for a comprehensive Nighttime
Economy Strategy to ensure that family-friendly, substance-free events and
street activations that foster social connectedness are included and well-
represented in the strategy; and
FURTHER THAT Vancouver City Council direct staff to apply a gender diversity
and inclusion lens in formulating recommendations for a comprehensive
Nightime Economy Strategy to consider issues of safety generally, but also
specifically for women and the LGBTQ2S+ community, as well as accessibility for
people with disabilities.
C. THAT Vancouver City Council affirm its support for a regional Night Transit
Strategy that seamlessly connects Metro Vancouver communities, in support of
the Vancouver and regional Nighttime Economies, including affirming Council’s
support for TransLink to explore transit options for Metro Vancouver residents to
return safely to their communities whether that be within the City of Vancouver or
for residents of Surrey, Burnaby, Coquitlam, Richmond and other Metro
Vancouver municipalities or for underserved residents of the UBC Endowment
Lands.

THAT, due to time constraints, the Committee refer items 9 and 10 to the Standing
Committee on City Finance and Services meeting on June 26, 2019 starting at 3:00 pm,
in order to hear from speakers.
CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY
10. Cannabis as an Alternative to Opiates and More Dangerous Drugs on the
Downtown Eastside
At the Regular Council meeting on June 11, 2019, Council referred the following motion to the
Standing Committee on Policy and Strategic Priorities meeting on June 12, 2019, to hear from
speakers, with a start time of 3pm.
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. In 2015, following several days of Public Hearings, Vancouver City Council
approved licensing rules for medical-cannabis dispensaries, including the
creation of an exclusion zone in the Downtown Eastside where marijuana sales
are prohibited except for sites with a property line on Hastings Street or Main
Street;
2. The City’s intention in creating an exclusion zone in the Downtown Eastside in
2015 was to limit the proximity of dispensaries to youth and vulnerable
populations;
3. On October 17, 2018, the federal Cannabis Act came into effect, making
recreational cannabis legal in Canada;
4. Prior to the October 17, 2018 legalization of cannabis in Canada, i.e., in June
2018, the federal government passed the bill to legalize recreational cannabis in
Canada, leading the provincial governments – including B.C. – to implement new
regulations for cannabis businesses to operate, and leading the City of
Vancouver to update its Zoning and Development and License by-laws to ensure
that Vancouver cannabis retailers operate in adherence to all regulations;
5. On December 20, 2018, a Special Meeting of Vancouver City Council was held
for the purpose of receiving a report from the Mayor’s Overdose Emergency Task
Force and to consider recommendations for immediate action on the overdose
crisis – recommendations Council unanimously supported;
6. On April 14, 2019, the City of Vancouver marked “the 1090th day since B.C.
declared the increase in overdose deaths as a public health emergency” by
declaring that the City would “fly the city’s flag at half-mast on this day each year
until B.C.’s provincial health officer rescinds the current state of public health
emergency.”;

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, June 12 and 19, 2019 40
7. Since April 14, 2016, more than 3,600 people have lost their lives to overdose in
B.C., with more than 1,000 of these deaths occurring in Vancouver, driven by an
increasingly toxic, unregulated drug supply that is contaminated by fentanyl,
carfentanil, and other contaminants;
8. Recent scientific findings have raised the possibility that cannabis might have a
beneficial role to play in the overdose crisis, with preliminary evidence linking
cannabis to reductions in the risk of experiencing drug-related harms, notably
through research conducted by UBC Professor M-J Milloy which showed that
among 2,500 hard drug users in the Downtown Eastside, cannabis helped
20 per cent to stay with treatment after a six-month period;
9. Vancouver City Council and the City of Vancouver generally support the
exploration of studies related to the opioid overdose crisis facing the city and the
role of cannabis in potentially addressing the situation, including two related
actions in the Mayor’s Emergency Overdose Task Force currently underway;
10. The CBC quotes Dr. Keith Ahamad, Medical Director for the Regional Addiction
Program at Vancouver Coastal Health, an addiction medicine clinician at St.
Paul’s Hospital, and a clinical researcher with the B.C. Centres on Substance
Use, as stating that the Downtown Eastside exclusion zone makes no sense
from a public health point of view and that the City’s “… current drug policy… is
obviously not working and actually worsening harm. It’s literally bad drug policy.”;
11. Health workers, addiction experts, and others working on the frontlines of the
Downtown Eastside have reported that the situation on the Downtown Eastside
has become much more dire since 2015, and have suggested that the exclusion
zone created by the City of Vancouver in 2015 has only served to further
stigmatize the Downtown Eastside instead of protecting its vulnerable population,
leaving people at the epicentre of the opioid crisis with no low-cost, legal options
if they want to use cannabis as an alternative to more dangerous drugs;
12. High Hopes Social Enterprise (HHSE), an organization that seeks to increase the
general well-being of the DTES community and support the sustainability and
resilience of its community and residents, has identified a need to enable low-
cost, legal cannabis options on the Downtown Eastside for the most vulnerable
people situated at the epicentre of the opioid crisis, people who may want to use
cannabis as an alternative to more dangerous drugs but cannot afford market
retail prices as stipulated by the province;
13. The Vancouver Overdose Prevention Society and High Hopes Social Enterprise
(HHSE) make note of support for low-cost, legal cannabis options on the
Downtown Eastside (potentially on the model of a community cannabis store with
a social enterprise and research focus), from, among others:
• Professor Evan Wood, MD, PhD, FRCPC, ABAM Dip, FASAM; Professor of
Medicine, UBC; Canada Research Chair in Inner City Medicine; Director,
British Columbia Centre on Substance Use; and Executive Director of the
British Columbia Centre on Substance Use (BCCSU).

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, June 12 and 19, 2019 41
• Professor M-J Milloy, PhD, Canopy Growth professor of cannabis science,
Assistant professor, Department of Medicine, University of British Columbia;
Research scientist, British Columbia Centre on Substance Use; New
Investigator, Canadian Institutes of Health Research; Scholar, Michael Smith
Foundation for Health Research.
• Dr. Mark Tyndall, Executive Medical Director BC Centre for Disease Control
14. All cannabis retail stores require a Provincial licence to operate and are regulated
and enforced by the BC Liquor and Cannabis Regulation Branch under the
Cannabis Control and Licensing Act;
15. There are currently four cannabis retail locations in the Downtown Eastside with
approved Development Permits, all of which will be eligible and expected to
apply for a provincial cannabis retail licence to operate as legal cannabis stores:
• 529 E Hastings Street (Hastings and Jackson St)
• 151 E Hastings Street (Hastings between Main and Columbia)
• 369 Columbia Street (Hastings and Columbia)
• 231 Abbott Street (Abbott and Cordova);
16. In order for the four cannabis retail locations noted above, all of which have
received Development Permits from the City, to proceed to the license
application phase with the provincial government, they will be required to close
with no guarantee that they will be granted a license or any clear indication as to
the timeframe for any license that may ultimately be issued, leaving the
Downtown Eastside without any retail cannabis locations for those who may wish
to use cannabis as an alternative to more dangerous drugs;
17. Despite the legalization of recreational marijuana in Canada, and regulatory
structures in place provincially and at the City of Vancouver, there does not
appear to be a regulatory option available that would enable low-cost, legal
cannabis (potentially on the model of a community cannabis store with a social
enterprise and research focus) for the Downtown Eastside and its most
vulnerable residents who may want to use cannabis as an alternative to opiates
and more dangerous drugs;
18. The City of Vancouver’s recent April 14, 2019 News Release (“Vancouver
mourns the lives lost to overdose on third-year anniversary of B.C.’s public health
emergency”) states: “The City is committed to addressing the issues that further
exacerbate the struggles around substance use. A comprehensive approach to
illicit substance use including prevention, harm reduction and treatment, will save
so many lives. We call upon health professionals, all levels of government, and
the public to join us in advocating for a safe drug supply, in Vancouver and
elsewhere in Canada, to protect residents and prevent any more unnecessary
deaths.”

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, June 12 and 19, 2019 42
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Vancouver City Council direct staff to make recommendations to Council
with respect to Section 11 of the City of Vancouver Zoning and Development
By-law with proposals on how this zoning by-law could be amended to allow
well-considered exceptions to the City’s current prohibition on Cannabis Stores in
the Downtown Eastside exclusion zone, consistent with the City’s commitment to
a comprehensive approach to illicit substance use, including prevention, harm
reduction, treatment, and addressing the issues that exacerbate the struggles
around substance use, and consistent with the dire, well-recognized nature of the
opioid crisis and the immense, devastating impact it is having on the people of
the City’s Downtown Eastside in particular;
FURTHER THAT Vancouver City Council direct staff to engage with the Liquor
and Cannabis Regulation Branch (LCRB) to indicate Vancouver City Council’s
desire to address unintended aspects of the City’s current Zoning and
Development By-law as it pertains to facilitating well-considered exceptions to
the City’s Zoning and Development By-law in relation to cannabis Stores in the
city, as well as engagement around the province’s regulatory processes for
licensing cannabis retail stores.
B. THAT Vancouver City Council direct staff to make urgent recommendations to
Council with respect to regulatory options and potential pathways that could
enable low-cost, legal cannabis options for the Downtown Eastside (potentially
on the model of a community cannabis store with a social enterprise and
research focus) for those people who may want to use cannabis as an alternative
to opiates and more dangerous drugs but cannot afford the market retail prices
stipulated by provincial regulations for a cannabis retail store.
