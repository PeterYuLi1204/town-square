WELCOME
The Mayor acknowledged we are on the unceded homelands of the Musqueam, Squamish, and
Tsleil-Waututh People. We thank them for having cared for this land and look forward to working
with them in partnership as we continue to build this great city together.
The Mayor also recognized the immense contributions of the City of Vancouver’s team
members who work hard every day to help make our city an incredible place to live, work, and
play.

On September 25, 2024, following roll call, Councillor Zhou rose on a point of parliamentary
procedure to ask staff through the Chair if his amendment from the Standing Committee on City
Finance and Services meeting of July 24, 2024, for the Members’ Motion entitled “Scope
Review for Improved Governance,” can be rescinded. Following staff’s response, the Mayor
ruled that the request was not in order pursuant to section 8.13 (1) of the Procedure By-law, as
it is not possible to rescind an adopted amendment as irreversible action has been taken. The
irreversible action is that a Special Council meeting is underway to consider the approval of the
by-law enactment entitled “A By-law to amend the Code of Conduct By-law No. 12886 regarding
independent reviews.”

Subsequently, Mayor Sim relinquished the Chair to Acting Mayor Kirby-Yung in order to provide
comments and resumed the Chair once done.

the motion itself. The Mayor ruled in favour of Councillor Kirby-Yung and reminded Council
members to keep their comments germane to the recess motion and to refrain from commenting
on the substance of the motion itself.
