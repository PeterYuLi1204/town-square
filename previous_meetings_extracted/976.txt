UNFINISHED BUSINESS
1. Deterring and Preventing Money Laundering and the Business of Organized Crime
in the City of Vancouver
On January 16, 2019, Vancouver City Council, at its meeting immediately following the Standing
Committee on City Finance and Services, referred debate and decision on the above-noted
motion to the Regular Council meeting to be held January 29, 2019, as Unfinished Business.
MOVED by Councillor De Genova
SECONDED by Councillor Dominato
WHEREAS
1. The Attorney General commissioned Peter German’s report titled “Dirty Money:
An Independent Review of Money Laundering in Lower Mainland Casinos
conducted for the Attorney General of British Columbia”;
2. The media reported that Mr. German estimates over $100 million dollars has
been laundered in B.C.;
3. In Fall 2018, Attorney General David Eby and Minister of Finance Carole James,
announced the Expert Panel on Money Laundering will be reviewing British
Columbia’s real estate sector and offering solutions to prevent market
manipulation and money laundering. The panel consists of three members, who
offer experience and knowledge pertaining to government policy, real estate and
money laundering;
4. Page 16 of the Dirty Money Report, recommendation “R45” suggests “That the
Province undertake research into allegations of organized crime penetration of
the real estate industry”;
5. In “Dirty Money” Mr. German states “79. Part 2 overviews the phenomenon of
transnational organized crime and the unique position in which Vancouver finds
itself. It describes the ‘Vancouver Model’, which provides a very practical
framework for what has occurred in recent years. A primer is included on money
laundering”;
6. Mr. German also states in his report the most lucrative crimes in Vancouver are
related to illegal drug sales. The drugs of choice cover the spectrum, from natural
products such as cannabis, cocaine and heroin, to chemical creations such as
opioids and hallucinogens;
7. The City of Vancouver Empty Homes Tax (Vacancy Tax By-law No. 11674) was
implemented in 2017 by City Council, collecting 1% of the property’s assessed
taxable value if the property is left vacant. Currently, there is no system to
confirm if the money collected by the City is directly or indirectly linked to money
laundering.

2. Improving the Effectiveness of the Empty Homes Tax
MOVED by Mayor Stewart
SECONDED by Councillor De Genova
WHEREAS
1. On November 16, 2016, Vancouver City Council approved the Empty Homes Tax
(EHT) program and enacted the Vacancy Tax By-law No. 11674 to impose a tax
on empty and under-utilized class 1 residential properties within the City of
Vancouver;
2. The City of Vancouver created the EHT to help return empty and under-utilized
properties to the market as long–term rental homes for people who live and work
in Vancouver;
3. Homes that are determined or deemed to be vacant are subject to a tax of 1% of
the property’s assessed taxable value. In order to determine which properties
were subject to EHT, all homeowners are required to make an annual EHT
declaration, confirming the status of their property as occupied;
4. Most residential properties are not subject to the tax, including homes that are
principal residences for at least six months of the year; homes that are rented out
for at least six months of the year; or homes that are eligible for one of eight
exemptions as set out in the EHT by-law;
5. In the Empty Homes Tax Annual Report for the 1st year of the tax, City staff
reported that a total of 7,923 homes were found to be vacant, of which 5,385
qualified for an exemption and 2,538 were charged the vacancy tax meaning that
over 67% of the vacant properties were exempt from the tax. Staff also noted that
audit work was ongoing and these numbers were likely to change;
6. On November 27, 2018, the Provincial Budget Measures Implementation
(Speculation and Vacancy Tax) Act, 2018 came into force, which is aimed at
preventing housing speculation and helping to turn vacant and underutilized
properties in certain regions of the province into homes for people who live and
work in B.C. This act applies in Vancouver and homeowners will be required to
make an annual declaration to the province by March 31st of each year, starting
in 2019, in addition to the EHT declaration;
7. The CMHC 2018 Rental Market Report showed vacancy rates for purpose built
rentals and rented condo stock fell slightly between 2017 and 2018 after
improving slightly from 2016 to 2017;
8. The declarations for the second year of the EHT program are currently underway
with a due date of February 4, 2019;
9. During the election, there was support for an increase in the EHT rate.

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, January 29, 2019 31
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct City staff to report back to Council
by the end of March 2019 with a plan to review and improve the fairness and
effectiveness of the Empty Homes Tax in achieving the objective of returning empty and
underutilized properties to the market as long term rental homes for people who live and
work in Vancouver;
FURTHER THAT the plan would include:
i. a review of the fairness and effectiveness of exemptions and definitions,
considering as well the Provincial Speculation Tax definitions;
ii. a proposed timeline to provide information on the potential impact of
increasing the Empty Homes Tax rate including program benefits and
potential drawbacks; and
iii. recommendations for public consultation and further internal analysis.

3. Persian New Year
MOVED by Councillor Swanson
SECONDED by Councillor Boyle
WHEREAS
1. Nowruz is the celebration of Spring Equinox, marking the beginning of the year
for hundreds of millions of people worldwide, celebrated in more than 15
countries from Eastern Europe to Central and South Asia, is a public holiday in
over 10 countries, and included in the UNESCO List of Intangible Cultural
Heritage of Humanity;
2. In 2009, the Parliament of Canada passed a bill to officially add Nowruz to the
national calendar of Canada, and the province of British Columbia proclaimed
March 20 as the day of Nowruz in B.C.;

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, January 29, 2019 32
3. Nowruz is a holiday that is about connecting people of diverse cultures and
backgrounds with nature, and Vancouver is proud of its diversity and its
connection to nature;
4. Iran is in the top ten countries that send immigrants to Vancouver, and Persian is
in the top ten non-official languages that Vancouverites speak.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT the City of Vancouver add Nowruz, the Persian New Year, to its official
celebrations and observations calendar.
B. THAT the City reaches out to the Persian community and collaborates to hold a
brief mid-day Nowruz celebration on or around March 20 at City Hall, with
participation from Mayor and Council.

4. Expanding Parking Options at EasyPark Lots and Parkades to Help Drivers Get
Home Safe, Support the Night Economy
MOVED by Councillor Dominato
SECONDED by Councillor De Genova
WHEREAS
1. The City of Vancouver manages parking to balance the needs of residents,
commuters, and visitors;
2. The City of Vancouver’s parkades and parking lots are managed and operated
by the Parking Corporation of Vancouver (EasyPark), a non-profit public authority
governed by a board of two appointed and eight elected directors;
3. EasyPark’s stated mission is “to provide safe, clean, friendly, convenient and
affordable parking to the Greater Vancouver community”;
4. EasyPark operations encompass more than 125 parking facilities;
5. EasyPark facilities are intended to act as an integral component of Vancouver's
transportation infrastructure, and their use is intended to be complementary to
the vitality of the downtown business community;
6. EasyPark prides itself on being a modern, innovative organization that constantly
upgrades its facilities to better serve public needs;
7. At the Wednesday, December 18, 2013, Standing Committee of Council on City
Finance and Services, Vancouver City Council unanimously supported a motion

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, January 29, 2019 34
directing City staff “to immediately implement a Pre-Paid Parking Program” in
order to create an incentive for people who have consumed more alcohol than
expected to a) leave their car behind, b) pay in advance for street parking for the
next morning, c) take a safe transportation option home, and d) retrieve their
vehicle safely the next day;
8. On July 16, 2018, the City of Vancouver introduced a “Park Until” feature on the
PayByPhone mobile app, offering users of the app the convenience to leave their
car overnight at a City parking meter and the ability to pay in advance for parking
the next morning;
9. The “Park Until” feature allows a driver to leave their vehicle overnight for up to
the maximum stay at the meter after paid parking comes into effect the next
morning – for example, where meters have a 3 hour limit, drivers can park their
vehicle until noon the next day – instead of having to come back first thing in the
morning to move their vehicle or add time;
10. The PayByPhone “Park Until” feature not only ensures that people are able to
enjoy all the night life Vancouver has to offer, while ensuring they can get home
safely, it also complements TransLink’s NightBus Hub initiative and offers an
important option for workers who may have been kept behind late after their night
shift ends;
11. Consistent with Council’s direction in 2013 to implement a “Pre-Paid Parking
Program”, the “Park Until” option on the City’s PayByPhone app helps to reduce
the harms and dangers associated with driving under the influence of alcohol
and/or other substances;
12. Impaired driving continues to be a public safety issue - last year the Vancouver
Police Department (VPD) undertook over 2,000 investigations where drugs or
alcohol were determined to be present in drivers of motor vehicles;
13. The convenient “Park Until” option available on the City’s PayByPhone system
does not appear to be available to those who make use of the City’s EasyPark
parking facilities.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Vancouver City Council direct staff to work with
EasyPark to explore the potential to expand the “Park Until” option to the City’s parkades
and parking lots managed and operated by the Parking Corporation of Vancouver
(EasyPark) and report back to Council by the end of Q1; and
FURTHER THAT staff’s report back to Council include background information on the
City’s EasyPark system, as well as recommendations for low-cost and no-cost ways in
which the City of Vancouver can help to promote and incentivize responsible

transportation choices for those who may have consumed more alcohol or other
substances than expected, including recommendations relating to any potential
opportunities there may be to work with other partners in the interest of public safety.

5. Increasing Support for Councillors for Constituency Work and Responding to
Public Concerns
MOVED by Mayor Stewart
SECONDED by Councillor Carr
WHEREAS
1. Vancouver City Councillors receive high volumes of communications from the
public, including emails, phone calls, requests to meet and requests for help on
constituency issues, regularly numbering in the hundreds per week;
2. Recognizing the need to provide Councillors with support outside the scope of
the duties performed by administrative assistants, a staff report of June 1, 2016,
recommended that Councillors receive a discretionary fund of $6,000 per
Councillor per year to carry out constituency activities which may include
communication expenses, fees for consulting or other contracted services, cost
of research and information gathering, and costs of community outreach and
events;
3. Under the by-law, Councillors may jointly incur discretionary expenses. All
Councillors’ discretionary expenses are publicly reported quarterly;
4. The $6,000 that Vancouver provides each Councillor for their constituency work
is greatly exceeded in other large Canadian cities: for example Toronto, due to
the decrease in number of Councillors from 44 to 25, just increased the budget
for each Councillor from $241,000 to $482,000 for their constituency work;
5. Communications from the public, including requests for help on issues, have
increased with the election of the new City Council in October of 2018;
6. The discretionary fund of $6,000 per Councillor per year is insufficient to contract
the services needed to meet constituency needs and ensure timely response to
public communications and requests for help.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT to better serve public needs, each Councillor’s
discretionary fund be immediately increased from $6,000 to $30,000 per year;
FURTHER THAT the source of funds for Councillors’ discretionary expenses in 2019
shall be the budgeted contingency fund;

Minutes, January 29, 2019 36
AND FURTHER THAT this increase be reviewed during the next budgeting process.

FURTHER THAT this committee, be comprised of qualified individuals with experiences
in areas including Human Resources and hiring personnel at executive levels possibly in
the private, public and non-profit sectors;
AND FURTHER THAT areas of the 2020 operating budget, be examined and any
recommendations to increase staff support for members of Council be reallocated from
other areas of the budget;
AND FURTHER THAT the mandate and purpose of any committee or research be to
review and provide recommendations on the staff support and other resources provided
to Council in the execution of their official duties;
AND FURTHER THAT the Committee report back before the 2020 budget to Vancouver
City Council with any findings and any recommendations;
AND FURTHER THAT this committee consider and examine any issues and
implications, including but not limited to:
i) No majority representation by any one political party is represented
among the eleven members of Council;
ii) The size of different caucuses and the needs of individuals Councillors;
iii) The Mayor’s vote is weighed the same as any other member of Council;
iv) The current staff support (political and non-political) the Mayor’s Office
receives in comparison to City Councillors;
v) Cities and municipalities similar in size to the City of Vancouver and the
staffing and support budget allocated to Council members.
