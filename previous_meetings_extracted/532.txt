3. Protecting BC Coasts From Acidic Washwater Dumping
MOVED by Councillor Fry
SECONDED by Councillor Carr
WHEREAS
1. In order to mitigate sulphur air pollution from burning heavy oil, the maritime
shipping industry employs Exhaust Gas Cleaning Systems (scrubbers) which
result in a washwater solution of concentrated acidic sulphates, metals, and other
toxins. Cruise, cargo, and other vessel traffic in Canadian jurisdiction annually
discharge tens of millions tonnes of this acidic washwater directly into BC’s
Coastal waters.
2. Globally, the issue of scrubber discharge 1 is a growing concern. The
International Council on Clean Transportation report of April 29, 2021 2 makes
clear that scrubber effluent creates pollution that causes harm to the ocean, both
locally and on an international scale. That same report found that Vancouver was
the fourth most dumped upon port globally.
3. Ocean acidification is of major concern to coastal communities, particularly those
coastal communities encouraging shellfish harvesting, aquaculture, tourism, and
commercial and recreational fisheries. Worldwide, authorities have variously
banned or are moving to limit the dumping of scrubber wash in coastal waters.
On the Pacific Coast of North America, California and Washington 3,4 have
implemented stricter protections, and on March 1, 2022 the Vancouver Fraser
Port Authority 5 intend to introduce phase one (of three) of new exhaust gas
cleaning systems wash water discharge requirements within its jurisdiction after
conclusive findings showed negative effects on aqualife and concentrations of
metals that exceeded thresholds.
4. Pacific Canada is one of the most diverse and productive marine environments in
the world. The Province of British Columbia has recently committed 6 to develop
a new coastal marine strategy – in cooperation with the federal government,
Indigenous peoples, and coastal communities – to provide a blueprint for future
stewardship, economic resilience and management of our coastal waters.
5. In January 2022, Vancouver City Council affirmed support for the Year of the
Salish Sea and recognized that “the Salish Sea is witnessing devastating
biodiversity loss, namely the risk of extinction of over 100 species of birds, fish,
invertebrates, mammals, and key species including Salmon and the Southern

THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT the following resolution be submitted to the LMLGA and UBCM for
consideration at their respective policy conventions:
WHEREAS in order to mitigate sulphur air pollution from burning heavy
oil, the maritime shipping industry employs exhaust gas cleaning systems
(scrubbers) which result in a solution of concentrated acidic sulphates,
metals, and other toxins. Cruise and cargo vessel traffic in Canadian
jurisdiction annually discharge tens of millions tonnes of this acidic
washwater directly into BC’s Coastal waters;
AND WHEREAS ocean acidification is of major concern to coastal
communities, particularly those coastal communities encouraging
shellfish harvesting, aquaculture, tourism, and commercial and
recreational fisheries. Worldwide, authorities have variously banned or
are moving to limit the dumping of scrubber wash in coastal waters. On
the Pacific Coast of North America, California and Washington have
implemented stricter protections, and on March 1st, 2022 the Vancouver
Fraser Port Authority will introduce phase one (of three) of new exhaust
gas cleaning systems washwater discharge requirements in its jurisdiction
after conclusive findings showed negative effects on aqualife and
concentrations of metals that exceeded safe thresholds:
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that UBCM request the BC government
commit to advocate to the federal government on the issue of exhaust
gas cleaning systems’ acidic wastewater discharge, as part of a
comprehensive BC Coastal Marine Strategy; pushing for stronger
environmental protections, in line with thriving cruise and cargo waters of
our US neighbours, to include preventative measures to stop scrubber
dumping from ships and require cleaner fuels be used.
B. THAT Council send a letter directly to the Minister of Transport, the honourable
Omar Alghabra, asking Transport Canada to take action on dumping from
vessels including exhaust gas cleaning systems effluent and washwater dumping
as part of any plan to encourage growth and increase numbers of large vessels
transiting through or coming to Canadian jurisdiction.
C. THAT Council send a letter directly to the Vancouver Fraser Port Authority in
support of their new exhaust gas cleaning systems washwater discharge
requirements, and in encouragement of the Port’s transition to greening the
industry through shore power, rolling truck age program and further strengthened
regulations to include all washwater discharge and eventually prohibiting the use
of scrubbers.

4. Assessing Vacant Lands to Support Housing For BC’s Most Vulnerable
MOVED by Councillor Fry
SECONDED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
WHEREAS
1. Property taxes are calculated by applying a City-determined mill rate against a
Province-determined assessment and land-use classification;
2. Owners of vacant land are incentivized to reduce their property taxes by
changing temporary use and assessment, for example by adding a community
garden to be re-classified as a (lower-taxed) Class 8 Recreational;
3. Properties assessed as Class 3 Supportive Housing integrate long-term housing
units with on-site supports for persons who were previously homeless or persons
who are at risk of homelessness; are subject to special valuation rules by the
provincial government that reduce the assessed value of the property to a
nominal amount; and have received funding from the government or a regional
health board;1
4. On February 9, 2022, Vancouver City Council approved the report Creating a
Tiny Shelter Pilot Project.2 The report identified that the target population for THV
[Tiny Home Village] met the definition of Class 3 but would “depend on the
availability of BC Housing or Vancouver Coastal Health Authority’s funding to the
pilot project”; and
5. Tiny Home Villages have been successfully deployed on vacant lots in other
jurisdictions as part of a strategy to shelter and triage homeless as a pathway to
permanent housing and better access to health and services. 3
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT the following resolution be submitted to the
2022 LMLGA and UBCM for consideration at their respective policy conventions, with
the three footnotes supplied as background:
WHEREAS sadly thousands of British Columbians are homeless, sleeping in
shelters, tents, and encampments. Many jurisdictions in Canada and down the
West Coast have successfully triaged their homelessness crises with temporary
tiny shelter type villages, as a transition to more permanent housing;
AND WHEREAS BC Assessment classifies property according to its use, and
local governments apply a mill rate to the respective classification to determine
taxes. Owners of vacant land are incentivized to reduce their property taxes by
changing temporary use and assessment, for example by adding a community
garden to be re-classified as a Class 8 Recreational;
AND WHEREAS properties assessed as Class 3 Supportive Housing integrate
long-term housing units with on-site supports for persons who were previously
homeless or persons who are at risk of homelessness; are subject to special

valuation rules by the provincial government that reduce the assessed value of
the property to a nominal amount; and have received funding from the
government or a regional health board:
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that UBCM request the BC government to work
with local governments to develop and fund an incentive for more readily and
rapidly repurposing vacant land as temporary Class 3 Supportive Housing, to
support the creation of emergency or ad-hoc housing or shelter with on site
supports as a short-term use, and including tiny homes, navigation centres,
portables, and/or modular housing.

5. Training of BC Workers in Deep Energy Retrofits and Climate-Smart Construction
MOVED by Councillor Carr
SECONDED by Councillor Hardwick
WHEREAS
1. B.C. is facing both a climate emergency and a housing affordability crisis;
2. The most affordable housing is that which is already standing, the most
affordable of which is aging and in need of climate-smart retrofits; and
3. Training workers in deep energy retrofits and construction of deeply affordable
climate-smart housing, including installing solar panels, solar hot water systems
and heat pumps would help alleviate the long wait-time for installations.

Council Meeting
Minutes, March 1, 2022 35
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT the following motion be forwarded by the City of Vancouver for
consideration by the Lower Mainland Local Government Association (LMLGA) at
its May 6-8, 2022, Annual Conference.
B. THAT the following motion be forwarded by the City of Vancouver for
consideration by the Union of B.C. Municipalities at its September 21-25, 2022,
Convention, if it is not forwarded by the LMLGA to the UBCM Convention.
MOTION: Increase B.C. Government Support for Worker Training in Energy Retrofits
and Construction of Climate-Smart Buildings
WHEREAS B.C. is facing both a climate emergency and a housing affordability crisis.
The most affordable housing is that which is already standing, the most affordable of
which is aging and in need of climate-smart retrofits which retain embodied emissions,
provide resilience in extreme weather and reduce GHGs. Training workers in deep
energy retrofits and construction of deeply affordable climate-smart housing, including
installing solar panels, solar hot water systems and heat pumps, would help alleviate
currently long installation and construction wait-times and enable a faster pace of
construction of climate-smart buildings and energy retrofits needed to achieve our
climate emergency goals.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that UBCM urge the Government of B.C. to increase
support and funding for trades training programs in deep energy retrofits, including
installing solar panels, solar hot water systems and heat pumps, and training in the
construction of climate-smart buildings including mass timber, Passive-House standard
and pre-fabricated net-zero-energy wood-frame modular buildings.

6. Increasing Provincial Incentives for Installing Solar (PV) Panels and Solar Hot
Water
MOVED by Councillor Carr
SECONDED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
WHEREAS
1. In 2021, rapidly changing climate brought a ‘heat dome’, ‘polar vortex’ and
‘atmospheric river’ to British Columbia, causing record high and low
temperatures, floods and fires, and high winds all of which destroyed
communities and highways and exposed the vulnerability of our infrastructure
and long-distance electricity grid;
2. Scientists are now predicting much more rapid climate change, with increased
likelihood and frequency of catastrophic weather events;

Council Meeting
Minutes, March 1, 2022 36
3. British Columbia’s electricity grid not only faced record-breaking demand for
energy in 2021 to cope with extreme weather, but also faces rapidly increasing
demand as communities, businesses and citizens work to reduce GHGs to meet
climate emergency targets by, for example, switching to electric vehicles, electric
hot water heating, and installing heat pumps and EV charging;
4. Globally, the installation of solar (PV) panels and solar hot water systems is
increasing rapidly as a measure to both mitigate and adapt to climate change.
For example, to increase renewable energy supply, starting in 2023 California is
requiring most new buildings to install solar panels. Also starting in 2023, Berlin
is requiring solar panel (PV) installations for all new buildings and major
renovations; and
5. B.C. Hydro’s Five-Year Electrification Plan, released by the government in
September of 2021, estimates that it has sufficient supply of clean electricity to
2030. The Plan includes measures to incentivize and achieve fuel switching from
fossil fuels to clean hydro-electric energy through government rebates and
financial incentives to switch to electric heat pumps and electric hot water
heaters. But there are no incentives for solar (photovoltaic) panels and solar hot
water systems that would increase the small-scale distributed supply of clean
energy which would both help meet the increasing demand for electricity and
greatly reduce energy costs for families and businesses.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT the following motion and supplementary memo be forwarded by the City of
Vancouver for consideration by the Lower Mainland Local Government
Association (LMLGA) at its May 4-6, 2022, Annual Conference.
B. THAT the following motion and supplementary memo be forwarded by the City of
Vancouver for consideration by the Union of B.C. Municipalities at its September
12-16, 2022, Convention, if it is not forwarded by the LMLGA to the UBCM
Convention.
MOTION: Provincial Incentives for Solar (PV) Panels and Solar Hot Water
WHEREAS the Province’s CleanBC Roadmap to 2030 and B.C. Hydro’s
Five-Year Electrification Plan, both released in the fall of 2021, promote rebates
to purchase electric heat pumps that incentivize British Columbians to switch
from using fossil fuels to hydro-electricity to heat their homes and hot water, thus
mitigating climate change by reducing GHGs. However, there are no equivalent
incentives for home and building owners to increase their own supply of
renewable energy or to reduce the demand for hydro-electricity, both of which will
become increasing important for climate resiliency as B.C. Hydro has estimated it
has sufficient supply of electricity only until 2030;
AND WHEREAS rebates for home and building owners to install solar hot water
systems and solar (photovoltaic) panels would increase the supply of clean

Minutes, March 1, 2022 37
energy as well as reduce energy costs for families and businesses both of which
increase climate resiliency:
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that UBCM request that the Government of
British Columbia pursue as quickly as possible adding financial incentives,
including increased feed-in-tariffs, for home and building owners to install solar
(photovoltaic) panels and solar-hot water systems;
AND BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that UBCM request that the Government of
B.C. modify the B.C. Building Code, and include in a future B.C. Existing
Buildings Alterations Code, specifications, including design and placement
standards, and load-bearing requirements, for solar (photovoltaic) panels and
solar hot water systems.

SUPPLEMENTARY MEMO
In 2021, rapidly changing climate brought a ‘heat dome’, ‘polar vortex’ and ‘atmospheric river’ to
British Columbia, causing record high and low temperatures, floods and fires, and high winds
which destroyed communities and highways and exposed the vulnerability of our infrastructure
and long-distance electricity grid.
Scientists are now predicting much more rapid climate change, with increased likelihood and
frequency of catastrophic weather events.
British Columbia’s electricity grid not only faced record-breaking demand for energy in 2021 to
cope with extreme weather, but also faces rapidly increasing demand as communities,
businesses and citizens work to reduce GHGs to meet climate emergency targets by, for
example, switching to electric vehicles, electric generators, electric hot water heating, and
installing heat pumps and EV charging.
Globally, the installation of solar (PV) panels and solar hot water systems is increasing rapidly
as a measure to both mitigate and adapt to climate change. For example, to increase renewable
energy supply, starting in 2023, the city of Berlin is requiring solar panel (PV) installations for all
new buildings and major renovations. In cooler temperate climates, solar hot water systems
typically heat 60 to 80 percent of hot water used per year and the summer productivity of solar
photovoltaic systems offset annual electricity costs.
B.C. Hydro’s Five-Year Electrification Plan, released by the government in September of 2021,
estimates that it has sufficient supply of clean electricity to 2030. The Plan includes measures to

7. The Unintended Consequences of Recent Policy Changes to DCL Waivers on
Affordable Housing
Prior to the motion being seconded, Councillor Carr rose on a point of order to inquire if the
motion was in order as the work was already being undertaken by staff and an update would be
coming to Council in June. The Mayor ruled the motion in order.
MOVED by Councillor Hardwick
SECONDED by Councillor Dominato
WHEREAS
1. The Development Cost Levy (DCL) Waiver was implemented in City of
Vancouver policy to incentivize secured market rental projects that include levels
of affordability below market. In July 2018 Council approved the Utilities
Development Cost Levy (UDCL) Waiver that came into effect in September 2018.
Eligible projects that obtained a building permit before September 30, 2021, were
granted extensions;
2. The Housing Vancouver Strategy includes the target of 20,000 new secured
rental units over ten years (by 2027);
3. The ‘Below Market Rental Housing Policy for Rezonings’ was approved by
Council on November 26, 2019, and states:
“After three years of monitoring, the City is not achieving the annual targets set
out in Housing Vancouver for new secured rental housing affordable to
households earning $80,000 per year and below. Concurrently, Vancouver’s
purpose-built rental vacancy rate has been less than 1 percent since 2014 while
the proportion of renter households in Vancouver continues to rise, resulting in
more renters competing for a limited number of rental units.”

Council Meeting
Minutes, March 1, 2022 39
4. Recent changes to the DCL bylaw eliminated previous waivers. Projects with
applications submitted before September 30, 2020, were to be provided in-
stream rate protection and the UDCL waiver, but only if they were granted a
Building Permit by September 30, 2021;
5. Many projects in compliance with the Rental 100 policy received regulatory
approval from Council before September 2020. Pro formas were calculated,
including DCL waivers applicable at the time of application. Housing Agreements
between the applicant and the City of Vancouver were negotiated conditional to
DCL waivers;
6. A total of thirteen projects were eligible for in-stream rate protection if eligible for
a building permit by the deadline of September 30, 2021. Staff have confirmed of
the thirteen, four projects, each approved by Council for thirty-fifty units of
secured market rental, were close to eligibility but did not meet the deadline;
7. Levels of affordability were secured with Housing Agreements for the thirteen
projects in exchange for a DCL or UDCL waiver. Non-market rental units
previously approved in Housing Agreements will no longer apply without the DCL
waiver. The result will be market rental for all units in each of these projects; and
8. Without the DCL/UDCL waiver, some projects may not be viable and may be
abandoned by applicants, affecting the overall overcomes of delivering secured-
rental in the Housing Vancouver Strategy.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to explore and establish criteria and bring
recommendations to Council with options to amend the DCL waiver to provide a
mechanism to provide incentives, including but not limited to DCL waivers, that
will protect the levels of affordability negotiated in the Rental 100 projects that
Council approved, yet did not meet the deadlines for in-stream rate protection;
FURTHER THAT staff report back to Council with these recommendations before
the end of April 2022.
B. THAT Council direct staff to provide metrics on how the changes to the housing
agreements in the absence of these waivers will affect the number and
affordability of units projected in the Housing Vancouver Strategy.

8. Centering Community Facilities and Infrastructure in 2023-2026 Capital Plan
MOVED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
SECONDED by Councillor Dominato
WHEREAS
1. The City of Vancouver Capital Plan is a four-year financial plan for investments in
the City's infrastructure and amenities such as water and sewer pipes, roads,
sidewalks, curb cuts, traffic signals and bikeways, community centres and
recreational facilities, arts and culture spaces, parks and open spaces, fire halls,
and libraries;
2. Vancouver’s 2023-2026 Capital Plan is currently being developed and is slated
for Council review and approval by July of this year;
3. Vancouver’s population is expected to grow by approximately 70,000 people in
the next 14 years and 188,000 in the next 39 years;
4. Vancouver has an existing infrastructure deficit that is significant and growing. It
includes the need for new and upgraded public-serving community facilities, as
well as utility upgrades and replacement of core City infrastructure that is at or
nearing the end of its life;
5. Aging infrastructure in the City includes water and sewer pipes that date from
1886 to the early 1960s, as well as community centres and recreational facilities
that were built between the 1940s and early 1980s;
6. There is also a need to address disparities between “have” and “have not”
neighbourhoods with respect to community and public safety facilities such as
community centres, ice rinks, and fire halls; i
7. There is also a growing demand from residents for improved streets and street
safety infrastructure such as pedestrian signals and flashing beacons, bike
routes, and lighting that support denser neighbourhoods and safely moving about
without the use of a vehicle;
8. Community facilities and infrastructure are key to livability in an increasingly
dense and unaffordable city. Vancouver’s pace has fallen behind in renewing
existing facilities and delivering new amenities to serve its current population let

Council Meeting
Minutes, March 1, 2022 41
alone a growing one. For example, it has taken decades to move forward with
renewal of the Marpole Community Centre that was built in 1949;
9. Likewise, the Kerrisdale Arena which dates back to 1949 also needs attention,
while at the same time the West End Plan amenities remain outstanding, the
Hastings Community Centre renewal has been shelved, and newly-established
and now populated neighbourhoods like the East Fraser Lands do not have a
community centre at all;
10. Significantly, the Gastown Complete Street project to protect this historic
neighbourhood and unlock its pedestrian potential has not been moved forward;
11. Recently, in response to a Council motion, staff have begun to quantify the
downloading of costs by senior levels of government, including spheres of federal
and/or provincial government jurisdictional responsibility such as housing and
childcare where the City has stepped in to deliver those services to meet
community needs;
12. Vancouver also experiences cost pressures and pressures on City operations
due to the impacts of the homelessness and mental health and addictions crises.
Without the requisite senior government support, these are rapidly eroding
Vancouver’s ability to deliver on civic and community facilities and infrastructure;
13. A recent staff report estimates the shortfall in senior government capital funding
due to cuts and/or reductions in funding – or where funding has not kept pace
with cost increases – to be in the order of ~$230.1 million, with an ~$158 million
shortfall that largely pertains to affordable housing needs and an ~$50 million
shortfall in funding support for the City’s Climate Emergency Response;
14. In response to COVID-19 related revenue shortfalls, staff sought and Council
approved a reduction of ~$254 million to the 2019-2022 Capital Plan, as well as
an allocation of ~$65 million of Emerging Priorities funding to support Council
priorities on climate emergency response, equity, and resilience. This
recalibration of the 2019-2022 Capital Plan was based on a comprehensive
review of major programs/projects across all service areas. Projects that were
determined could be de-scoped and/or deferred to future capital plans in whole
or in part due to the recalibration were largely centred on core infrastructure such
as:
• the installation and/or refurbishment of curb ramps at intersections,
• the installation of new traffic signals where none currently exist,
• new street lighting,
• the Gastown Complete Street project,

• upgrading of existing sewer mains to meet growth-related demands,
• and projects to ensure water system resilience among many others; ii

Council Meeting
Minutes, March 1, 2022 42
15. Community facilities and core infrastructure, in addition to being a core civic
responsibility, are also climate infrastructure. During extreme weather events due
to climate change, the city’s community centres become cooling and warming
centers and gathering spaces where the community comes together. Aging and
unseparated sewer pipes can result in overflows and flooding due to extreme
weather and degrade our environment;
16. The City’s transportation infrastructure, which includes new sidewalks, curb cuts,
and traffic lights, also plays a vital role in supporting climate resiliency. Being
able to walk and ride safely in your neighbourhood gives people greener
alternatives and supports health and livability;
17. On February 9, 2022, Council unanimously supported a motion to align
Vancouver’s 2023-2026 Capital Plan with increased climate emergency action.
The motion directed staff to report back early in the 2023-2026 capital budget
planning process with a list of potential capital projects, with associated costs,
benefits and estimated GHG reductions, to achieve – among other things – the
necessary reductions in the city’s GHG emissions to reach, at minimum, the
stated goal of 50% reductions in GHG emissions below 2007 levels by 2030;
18. An amendment to the February 9, 2022, motion added direction to staff to also
report back with a list of potential capital projects intended to address
Vancouver’s combined sewer overflows as part of the City’s commitment to
accelerate action on overflow reduction using a “One Water” integrated
approach, including associated costs and environmental benefits; and
19. Having renewed and new community facilities and core infrastructure is essential
to residents’ quality of life and helps to create equity and ensure climate
resiliency. As Vancouver’s population continues to grow, and the city’s already
aging infrastructure and amenities continue to degrade, the City needs to make
sufficient, strategic investments to maintain livability and to enhance the
sustainability and resilience of our city.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to report back early in the 2023-2026 capital budget
planning process with a list of potential capital projects that centers community
facilities and aging infrastructure to address the City’s significant infrastructure
deficit, including utility upgrades and core infrastructure at the end of its duty
cycle which needs to be replaced.
B. THAT the list of potential capital projects include community facilities such as the
new East Fraser Lands Community Centre, the renewal and expansion of the
West End Community Centre, streets initiatives like the Gastown Complete
Street Project, new and improved sidewalks and walking paths, curb ramps at
intersections, pedestrian signals and beacons, the installation of new traffic
signals where none currently exist to address identified safety considerations,
park, green spaces and natural area improvements, as well as priority fire hall
renewals.

WHEREAS
1. B.C. is facing both a climate emergency and a housing affordability crisis;
2. One of the most affordable and climate-smart forms of new built single-family and
multi-family housing is pre-fabricated modular wood-frame housing which
typically reduces construction time up to 50 percent, and overall costs of
construction up to 25 percent;
3. Climate-smart modular and prefabricated buildings include solar-ready features,
Passive House designs, built-in renewable energy, socially and ecologically
sustainable materials, water harvesting and water reuse such as embedded
rainwater harvesting, greywater and water reuse systems, innovative energy
systems and super insulated envelopes; and

Council Meeting
Minutes, March 1, 2022 44
4. While the Government of B.C. has promoted climate-smart B.C. mass timber
construction materials that can ideally replace GHG-intense concrete
construction for buildings above 6 storeys, and has used wood-frame modular
housing in B.C. Housing projects, it has not yet facilitated equally promoted a
made-in-B.C. industry to produce Passive House standard, pre-fabricated wood-
frame modular housing that can reduce the cost and increase the affordability of
housing up to 6 storeys.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT the following motion be forwarded by the City of Vancouver for
consideration by the Lower Mainland Local Government Association (LMLGA) at
its May 4-6, 2022, Annual Conference.
B. THAT the following motion be forwarded by the City of Vancouver for
consideration by the Union of B.C. Municipalities at its September 12-16, 2022,
Convention, if it is not forwarded by the LMLGA to the UBCM Convention.
MOTION: Expanding B.C. Use of Climate-Smart Prefabricated Wood-Frame
Housing
WHEREAS B.C. is facing both a climate emergency and a housing affordability
crisis and one of the most affordable forms of new built single-family and multi-
family housing is pre-fabricated wood-frame housing, typically taking one-half the
time to construct and costing one-third to one-half the cost of concrete
construction;
AND WHEREAS B.C. is in the enviable position of having a supply of second-
growth wood that could be utilized for a sustainable value-added industry in the
manufacture of Passive House standard, wood-frame pre-fabricated modular
housing:
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that UBCM urge the Government of British
Columbia to enable, support and promote the development of a zero-carbon
standard, wood-frame modular housing manufacturing industry in B.C., including
by modifying the B.C. Building Code and B.C. Step Code to enable quicker
permitting and approval of prefabricated wood-frame housing and by
encouraging B.C. Housing to utilize B.C.-produced prefabricated wood-frame
housing wherever possible in its projects.

10. A Regulatory Framework to Enable Innovative Urban Activation Projects
MOVED by Councillor Dominato
SECONDED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
WHEREAS
1. Vancouver City Council strives at all times to create walkable, complete,
connected, culturally vibrant neighbourhoods, including the larger aspiration to
become a 15-minute city that lessens the use of personal vehicles, activates
underutilized urban spaces, and bring goods and services closer to end
consumers in their neighborhoods; i
2. The circumstances and conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic over the past two
years have neither altered nor diminished Council’s commitment to creating
walkable, complete, connected, culturally vibrant neighbourhoods;
3. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a wide range of adaptations,
innovations, and societal changes in many spheres of life including changes in
consumer behaviour, in how and where people work, as well as a marked
increase in all manner of e-commerce transactions and delivery mechanisms for
goods and services to consumers;
4. Encouraging and facilitating social, cultural, and technological innovations,
wherever and whenever these have demonstrated the power and potential to a)
enhance and improve the lives of the city’s residents and businesses, b) advance
the policy goals and objectives of Council and the City, and c) activate and
otherwise enrich the city’s neighbourhoods, is fundamentally sound from a public
policy perspective and logical for elected bodies to embrace and enable;
5. As a 21st century society, we live in a state of constant evolution and rapid
innovation, with fast-changing trends among consumers that – in many ways –
respond to innovations and new technologies. At the most basic level, innovation
means introducing new methods, ideas, or products and it includes the
development of new processes and business models that better fit the needs of
consumers;
6. A number of innovative projects that exemplify new methods, ideas, products,
and/or business models that respond to the evolving needs of consumers have
recently come to the attention of members of Council. These projects have the
clear potential to support Council’s objective to
a) create walkable, complete, connected, culturally vibrant
neighbourhoods;
b) become a 15-minute city;
c) activate the city’s streets and underutilized urban spaces, and
d) bring goods and services closer to end consumers in their
neighborhoods;

Council Meeting
Minutes, March 1, 2022 46
7. Despite the City’s and Council’s stated policy objectives and the strategies meant
to achieve these objectives, the City’s existing By-laws and permitting framework
have proven challenging to several of these innovative projects because they do
not fit easily into the existing categories and structures of the City’s regulatory
framework. Instead of proceeding smoothly toward activating underutilized
spaces in the city, these projects have encountered a variety of policy, By-law,
and permitting obstacles, impediments, challenges, and paradoxes;
8. Examples of several innovative projects that embody new methods, ideas,
products, and/or business models that have encountered By-law, policy, and
permitting obstacles and impediments due to the limitations, structures, and
categories of the City’s current regulatory framework include:
• ROLL TECHNOLOGIES: A Canadian company that aims to bridge the
gaps in public transportation and grow micro-mobility alternatives safely
and sustainably toward reshaping urban mobility as cities outgrow their
reliance on cars. The company is working to launch a pilot in Vancouver
with 50 e-bikes this spring and summer, leveraging underutilized space in
City owned EasyPark lots. Each e-bike has its own physical locking
mechanism on the back wheel, with an app used to unlock the bikes. In
addition to the requirement of a business license for each site, the
operator was initially advised that a Development Permit (DP) was
required for each EasyPark location. Car share companies leasing spots
in EasyPark lots do not require a DP, adding confusion and complexity to
the application;
• BLOOM COMMUNITY PROJECTS: The Bloom project seeks to activate
underutilized urban spaces with retail and food opportunities. Their
current project is to activate the south side of The Plaza Nations on a
seasonal basis. The project would create a free-flowing outdoor patio
space with pop-up units ranging in size from 150 – 200 square feet.
These pop-up units would feature local retailers, rotating
artists/installations, food and beverage kiosks, as well as breweries,
cafés, snacks, wine bars, and cocktail collaborations. The project is
intended to showcase and support local businesses and provide a unique
customer experience for pedestrians along a heavily used section of the
downtown seawall. The proposal requires a longer term special events
permit and a development permit. The process for obtaining and
coordinating these permits has been challenging, and the critical gap has
been there is no clear guidance for prospective proponents to follow;
• REEF TECHNOLOGY: REEF is the largest operator of neighbourhood
kitchens and urban logistics hubs in the United States and Canada. In
April of 2021, REEF announced an expansion of its NBRHD Restaurant
Development Program to Vancouver making use of underutilized urban
spaces. The REEF model is designed to help local restaurants scale their
delivery business and bring goods and services closer to end consumers
in their neighbourhoods. Vancouver is the first Canadian city for a REEF
pilot project, and restaurants with fewer than three locations are qualified

Council Meeting
Minutes, March 1, 2022 47
to apply for the pilot program – with priority for underrepresented groups
including local women and Indigenous-owned restaurants to apply.
Despite support for the project, it has encountered By-law, policy, and
permitting obstacles and impediments due to the limitations of the City’s
current regulatory framework;
• FARMERS MARKETS: Last summer the Vancouver Farmers Market
sought to relocate its Main Street location to 88 Pacific Boulevard,
triggering the usual special events permit, but also a Development Permit
(DP) because it was on private property. While the private property owner
supported the Farmer’s Market activating this urban space on a
temporary basis, there were concerns and confusion over the site
triggering a DP;
9. As with the examples of innovative projects noted above, urban agriculture
(community gardens, urban farms) and farmers markets represent additional
examples of innovative urban activation projects where By-law and permitting
challenges have been experienced. Staff advise that urban agriculture projects
are supported and facilitated by numerous City policies and strategies,
notwithstanding challenges that have been experienced; and
10. The regulatory obstacles and challenges that have been encountered by various
innovative projects that meet the stated policy objectives of Council and the City
point to the need for a review the City’s regulatory framework as it pertains to
innovative new land use models for underutilized urban spaces. There is a need
to ensure that the City’s By-laws, plans, policies, strategies, and procedures are
appropriately in alignment with the City’s stated policy objectives and therefore
capable of – and adaptable enough – to accommodate and facilitate innovative
projects that have the potential to benefit the city and its residents in a timely
manner by way of a more streamlined and simplified application and approval
process.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to review the City’s
regulatory framework that currently enables innovative urban activation projects on
underutilized public and private properties with the goal of streamlining and simplifying
the process for prospective proponents, including consideration for establishing a clear
set of guidelines and pathways for advancing these projects;
FURTHER THAT staff be directed to report back to Council by the end of Q2 2023 with
recommendations for a draft set of guidelines and pathways that address current
obstacles and impediments to enabling innovative urban activation projects and models;
AND FURTHER THAT the guidelines to streamline and simplify the City’s existing
application and approval processes for innovative urban activation projects should serve
as a precursor to – and serve to inform – any and all future reviews and revisions to
relevant By-laws, policies, and regulatory frameworks as they relate to the City’s goal to
create walkable, complete, connected, culturally vibrant neighbourhoods in the city as
well as the larger aspiration to become a 15-minute city.

2. Support for the Vancouver Fraser Port Authority Rolling Truck Age Program
MOVED by Councillor Dominato
SECONDED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
WHEREAS
1. The trucking industry plays a major role in B.C.’s robust economy, connecting
residents throughout the province and across Canada with the goods they need.
Keeping these goods moving, however, takes a significant toll on our community;
2. Hundreds of thousands of truck trips move through Vancouver each year, largely
through busy corridors, leaving behind carcinogenic emissions that negatively
affect the health of residents who live and work in these neighbourhoods;
3. Vancouver’s Climate Emergency Action Plan calls for the city to reduce its
carbon pollution by 50% by 2030 – a goal that requires working with residents,
businesses and partners in government toward the same end;
4. The Vancouver Fraser Port Authority – the federal agency responsible for the
stewardship of the lands and waters that make up the Port of Vancouver,
Canada’s largest port – has a mandate is to enable Canada’s trade through the
port, while protecting the environment, and with consideration for local
communities;
5. Vancouver Fraser Port Authority has embarked upon a Rolling Truck Age
Program that caps the age of container trucks serving the port to support safer,
more reliable trucks and cleaner air for our communities;
6. The Port Authority’s Rolling Truck Program estimates that it will result in a 93%
decrease in particulate matter, an 80% decrease in smog-forming pollutants, and
a 2.5% decrease in greenhouse gasses, and deliver significant benefits to the
health of Vancouver residents and visitors and the quality of the air we breathe;
7. The Rolling Truck Age Program was scheduled to come into effect February 1,
2022;
8. Due to short-term challenges for the trucking industry stemming from COVID19,
the global supply chain for new trucks, and a request from the federal Transport
Minister to consider a delay in implementing the Rolling Truck Program, the
Vancouver Fraser Port Authority postponed the program’s implementation date
to provide additional time and engagement opportunities for the industry;
9. Capping the age of heavy container trucks serving the port, and pulling older,
more polluting trucks off the road in favour of safer, more reliable trucks and
cleaner air for our communities, is an important step in reducing greenhouse gas
emissions and slowing the effects of climate change; and

Council Meeting
Minutes, March 1, 2022 51
10. Given the Rolling Truck Program’s tremendous environmental and public health
benefits, it is important that the program be implemented as soon as possible
following this 90-day period of consultation.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council request that the Mayor write to the
Federal Minister of Transport, the Hon. Omar Alghabra, on behalf of Council to express
our enthusiastic support for the Vancouver Fraser Port Authority’s Rolling Truck Age
Program and the tremendous environmental and public health benefits it will bring;
FURTHER THAT Council request that the letter to the Minister of Transport express
Council’s collective desire and support for the Rolling Truck Age Program to be
implemented as soon as possible following the 90-day period of engagement and
consultation.

MOVED by Councillor Wiebe
SECONDED by Councillor Fry
THAT the motion below be referred to the Nomination Subcommittee for review.
WHEREAS
1. Municipalities, locally and internationally, are increasingly recognizing the need to
provide equity-denied populations, especially those experiencing poverty and
other systemic barriers to access, with services and infrastructure for community
development;
2. This includes acknowledging the complexity of doing work in the areas of justice,
equity, diversity, decolonisation, inclusion and liberation on the stolen lands of
the Musqueam, Squamish, and Tsleil-Waututh Nations. Beyond
acknowledgement, this work includes taking actions to decolonize our daily
practices as well as our institutions and governing bodies;

Council Meeting
Minutes, March 1, 2022 52
3. Strategies are actively being developed by the City of Vancouver and its City
Council, the Vancouver Board of Parks and Recreation, and Advisory Bodies to
strengthen respectful engagement and increase access to participation for
Indigenous members of the community, BIPOC, and others who may experience
systemic barriers to access in civic processes;
4. In particular, the Vancouver Board of Parks and Recreation has demonstrated
more accessible, supportive and respectful processes around community
engagement throughout their recent updates to the Local Food Systems Action
Plan’s Community Advisory Committee. For example, honoraria for elders and
participants as well as food and transport supports, which were readily available
and offered with clarity to those who participated in outreach and meetings;
5. Building a strong social safety net, that ensures that all Canadians have access
to housing, food, transportation, internet, and other utilities, is the best way to
help all people participate in advisory committees. In lieu of that provincial and
federal support, municipalities who choose to engage with community members
have a responsibility to acknowledge the burdens and barriers that exist in order
to provide feedback as an advisory council; and
6. Participating on Advisory Councils can be overwhelming, retraumatizing and
inaccessible, especially for those who are stepping into systems that have
historically and in ongoing ways caused them harm.
AND WHEREAS The Vancouver Food Policy Council
1. Has been exploring and practicing ways to increase accessibility with respect to
membership of those equity denied groups who may experience multiple barriers
to full civic participation;
2. Is committed to developing and advancing protocols of respect and reciprocity;
building our decolonizing practices; embodying our values and establishing
systems to address systemic barriers to access in Advisory Council meetings
and related activities;
3. Through the Administration Team/Chair, has utilized the following strategies:
a. Supporting the voices of those who are equity denied in coming into the
room either through community engaged processes, or through
presentations and community engaged components of our meetings;
b. Advocating for increased clarity around processes, expectations, and
supports available for members in Advisory Councils (i.e. process around

Council Meeting
Minutes, March 1, 2022 53
access to childcare, food, and transportation supports/stipends);
c. Slowing down Land Acknowledgements and making space for group
introductions, cultural welcomes, speaking circles and gifts in our
processes;
d. Providing information and documents in alternative formats (e.g., PDF
and email, verbal/oral feedback options);
e. Setting up lateral mentorship relationships with members that have
access needs not being met by the existing structures;
f. Providing additional training/tools to navigate technology platforms,
communication tools and procedures regarding motions and voting;
g. Building a resource list to share with membership for self-guided learning;
h. Building a protocol around gifting recognising honoraria is a gift, an
acknowledgement of time, given with dignity, transparency, respect;
where made possible by funding, special occasion or other;
i. Building community agreements together, including shared terms and
common definitions; and
j. Building our agendas to share resources that support each item.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT the Vancouver Food Policy Council calls on the
City of Vancouver to support the following mechanisms to deepen accessibility on
Advisory Councils:
a. Clearly outline all financial support and processes for accessing support, for
members and prospective members, (especially regarding food/meal,
transportation, and dependent supports). As part of this, direct staff to:
i. Further work to make the process of reimbursements more accessible,
user-friendly, and timely, reducing barriers around the collection of SIN
number and other personal information;
ii. Increase allowance for food in budgets to support healthier and more
culturally appropriate choices;
iii. Provide financial support for transportation and food for all formats of
meetings - online/hybrid/in-person;

Council Meeting
Minutes, March 1, 2022 54
iv. Consider structures for providing a discretionary budget to each Advisory
Committee which may be applied to awareness, outreach, celebration,
honoring and other resourcing of members;
v. Further explore supports for language accessibility to ensure that non-
English speakers can participate in meaningful ways.
b. Extend the length, and expand and diversify the reach of recruitment and build in
overlap between terms.
c. Prioritise succession planning between terms and communication within terms.
As part of this, direct staff to:
i. Make a file sharing and communication platform available to all Advisory
Bodies and provide support such as training to ensure the platform is
accessible to all members. Considering privacy concerns, accessibility,
and usability of platform.
ii. During recruitment and membership, make clear the resources available
to committees, ie. financial supports, and explore providing options for
testimonials from previous committee members.
iii. Make accessible automated Closed Captioning of all meetings.
d. Support more welcoming, inclusive and interconnected committee structures:
i. Reduce formality of motions being the prevailing pathway that Council
hears from committees; offer and support alternative options of letters
and consensus based decision sharing.
ii. Support committees in prioritising room in meetings for
introductions/check-ins for all voices in the room to share.
iii. Support inter-advisory committee collaboration ie. facilitate bi-annual
collaborative space for all chairs of committees to gather.

4. Motion from the Vancouver Food Policy Council for Solidarity with Indigenous
Food Sovereignty Movement
MOVED by Councillor Wiebe
SECONDED by Councillor Fry
THAT the motion below be referred to UNDRIP Task Force for review.
WHEREAS
1. The City of Vancouver declared itself a City of Reconciliation in July 2014 and
updated this declaration in 2021 to include a commitment to adopting the United
Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP);1
2. In order to put Reconciliation into action we must slow down and listen deeply to
Indigenous voices, and dismantle barriers to accessibility, decolonising our
practices. How we do the work matters;
3. Indigenous people are the best stewards of their lands and “recognizing the role
of Indigenous lands and leadership in biodiversity conservation and facilitating
partnerships to ensure the conservation of habitats on Indigenous lands can
provide crucial opportunities for countries like Canada to meet their international
commitments;” 2
4. There is opportunity and need to apply the lens of Indigenous Food Sovereignty
to City of Vancouver directions and plans: to resource and create networks of
Indigenous Food Gardens led by Indigenous peoples and organisations, that
rewild our city, foster biodiversity through forage and habitat including pollinators,
fungi, birds and fish, increasing our resilience as inter-species community.3
Examples where this lens may be applied:
a. The City of Vancouver passed an amendment to Urban Forest Strategy to
use natural management for boulevards, in December 2021; 4.
b. The City of Vancouver has directed staff to consider quick start actions to
support complete communities, including reallocation of 11% of
neighbourhood streets for public uses such as parks space and
community food gardens, on October 6th 2020; 5

5. The Vancouver Board of Parks and Recreation recently passed an update to
thee Local Food Systems Action Plan (LFSAP) which clearly identifies the priority
and need to support Indigenous Led community gardens, food systems, and
spaces:
a. 1.7 “Increase annual resources (funding, staff time, program space and
materials) for Indigenous related food initiatives led by Indigenous
partners. Initiatives this funding may support include Indigenous
educational toolkits, feasts, celebrations, fieldhouse residencies, youth
land-based food programs, intergenerational food knowledge sharing,
and the services of Indigenous cultural practitioners.”
b. 1.6 “Increase annual resources (land, funding, staff time, program space,
and materials) allocated to cultural learning garden development and
maintenance and seek partnerships with Indigenous-led organizations to
create these gardens based on park locations identified by xʷməθkʷəyə̓
m, Sḵwxw̱ ú7mesh, and səlilwətaɬ First Nations and Urban Indigenous
peoples as key sites.”;
6. There is leadership from Indigenous Host Nations and Urban Indigenous leaders,
and Community Organisations, offering connection and belonging through
access to land and food, which includes access to culture, health, healing and
connection;
Examples of this leadership includes:
a. Exploring Food Sovereignty in Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside: Kanatiio
Gabirel. This work is being demonstrated and deepened at Astoria Urban
Farm alongside and in collaboration with many community organisations-
the Executive Summary is on display for public engagement at RayCam
Community Centre and was presented to Vancouver Food Policy Council
January 13th 2022;
b. Working Group on Indigenous Food Sovereignty (WGIFS) and Wild
Salmon Caravan: “Indigenous hunting, fishing and gathering strategies
are some of the most sustainable adaptation strategies of humanity.
While many of the practices and protocols have persisted into the 21st
century, the traditional social structures and interdependent relationship
to the land, water, plants and animals have been fragmented by the
techno-bureaucratic framework instituted within colonial institutions.”

7. Especially in this pandemic time, and this time of extreme climate change,
isolation is detrimental to the health and well being of us all, and disconnection
from land and food is devastating. When we discuss Just Recovery, Climate
Justice and Reconciliation, we must think about access to land, and apply the
lenses of Decolonising, Indigenous Food Sovereignty, Accessibility and
Inclusion.
AND WHEREAS the Vancouver Food Policy Council officially supports and stands in
solidarity with the Indigenous Food Sovereignty Movement, as evidenced by the
following motions:
1. Budget 2022 Motion, November 2021: “Prioritise and centre Indigenous
Leadership, listening deeply to voices of lived and living experience, to those who
have stewarded the lands, soils and waterways of this place since time
immemorial.”;

structure for conversation and shared learning; deeply listening to local Host

knowing in supporting the long-term stewardship of place, so that all future
generations can be blessed with the bounty of these shared lands and waters.

Indigenous Food Sovereignty, with process of listening deeply to Indigenous
peoples; and to approach implementation by directing staff to:

including Vancouver Plan, Broadway Plan, Capital Plan, and Vancouver
Social Infrastructure Strategy that prioritise actions that support
Indigenous food sovereignty, community leadership.

meaningful and supported input on, and supportive and inclusive
opportunity through these initiatives. This includes resourcing the capital,
technical, and human resource components of all work.
4. Calls upon the City of Vancouver to direct staff to prioritise commitments made in
2021 to scoping a Colonial Audit of the City of Vancouver’s own governance
structures, including Advisory Committees; and to bring forward the “full review of
colonial influences on which the City was founded.” 12
5. Calls upon the City of Vancouver to direct staff to connect with Cultural Services
staff to explore how programming and policy may be extended to gardens and
food-cultivation spaces, which are cultural spaces where intergenerational and
cross-cultural education, ceremony, arts, food production, connection, healing
and habitat enhancement, all happen.
6. Calls upon the City of Vancouver to ask Transformational questions of itself - so
we all may be held accountable, in shared community for this work.

ENQUIRIES AND OTHER MATTERS
1. Rezoning Enquiry
Councillor Fry noted the Mayors motion from May 2020 entitled “Improving the Effectiveness
and Efficiency of Development Application Processes”, which made a rezoning enquiry
voluntary and not mandatory for any rezoning application due to the time they add to the
rezoning process. He noted he has heard frustration from the industry that they are still under
pressure to resubmit a rezoning enquiry despite the Council direction from the approved motion.
He enquired whether staff are still directing a formal rezoning enquiry at the policy enquiry
stage. He also enquired how often a rezoning enquiry is actually forgone and how often are
staff telling applicants that a rezoning enquiry is not necessary. The City Manager agreed to
provide a response.

Councillor Kirby-Yung noted there is a demand for people to stage events in the city. She noted
the Chinatown Festival was wanting to restage their event in July 2022 and were advised by
staff they are looking at a nine month timeline due to the complexity of the event. She enquired
if the City will be able to make small and large events happen in the near future. The City
Manager advised that staff are working on what they can do to make the events happen. He
also advised that staff are currently meeting with the organizers of the Chinatown Festival to
consider options and he agreed to provide Council with an update.
3. Situation in Ukraine
Councillor Carr noted the City has a sister city in Ukraine, which is Odesa. Councillor Carr
enquired what the City could do in terms of supporting people in the Ukraine, regarding services
to families, communication, support for incoming refugees, and whether there is something the
City can do for Odesa, which is under attack. The City Manager noted the Mayor has
corresponded with the City’s counterpart in Odesa stating the City’s support. He also noted
