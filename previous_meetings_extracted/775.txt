4. Ending Street Checks in Vancouver
At the Council meeting on July 21, 2020, Council referred the following motion to the Standing
Committee on Policy and Strategic Priorities meeting on July 22, 2020, in order to hear from
speakers.
* * * * *
Prior to debate on this matter, Councillor Kirby-Yung rose to declare a conflict of interest, as she
was receiving distressing communication from members of the public and did not want the
perception of how she may vote to interfere with the process.
The Mayor rose and requested a ruling of the Chair, as he did not think her declaration was a
conflict of interest. The Chair consulted with staff and the City Manager, and ruled the conflict of
interest out of order as she was recusing herself due to being targeted inappropriately, and not
because she was in conflict.
Following the ruling of the Chair, Councillor Kirby-Yung rose and declared a conflict of interest
out of an abundance of caution, as she was potentially in conflict in the perception of bias. She
left the meeting at 4:41 pm and did not return until 9:16 pm, at the completion of the item.
* * * * *
The Committee heard from 34 speakers in support of the recommendations.
* * * * *
During the hearing of speakers, it was
MOVED by Councillor Hardwick
THAT Council complete hearing speaker 2, and asking questions of them, prior to the

The Committee recessed on July 22, 2020, at 5:01 pm and reconvened at 6:03 pm.
* * * * *
MOVED by Mayor Stewart
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. People and organizations around the world and in Vancouver (including the
British Columbia Civil Liberties Association, Union of British Columbia Indian
Chiefs, Black Lives Matter Vancouver, and the Hogan’s Alley Society) are calling
for reforms to how police services are delivered, including ending street checks -
the practice of stopping a person outside of an investigation, and often obtaining
and recording their personal information;
2. Data released by the Vancouver Police Department in 2018 showed almost
100,000 street checks were conducted by the VPD between 2008 and 2017, with
Indigenous and Black people being significantly overrepresented in these checks
compared to their proportion of the population;
3. Following the implementation of new provincial guidelines in January 2020, VPD
has reported a 91% reduction in street checks;
4. The Vancouver Police Board has recently committed to new actions to improve
policing services including: establishing a new Black and African Diaspora
Advisory Committee, providing historical awareness and cultural sensitivity
training for current and future officers regarding the experiences of Black people,
participating in anti-bias and cultural sensitivity training, working with the existing
Indigenous Advisory Committee to improve training for current and future officers
regarding Indigenous Peoples cultural sensitivity, enhancing communication
between the Board, Vancouver City Council, and the Musqueam regarding the
provision of policing services in Vancouver, and, reviewing the efficacy of the new
street check policy;
5. Police Act Section 26 states “In consultation with the chief constable, the
municipal police board must determine the priorities, goals and objectives of the
municipal police department” and that “in determining the priorities, goals and
objectives of the municipal police department, the municipal police board must
take into account….the priorities, goals and objectives of the council of the
municipality”;
6. The Vancouver Police Board has the authority to end the practice of street
checks in Vancouver; and

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, July 22, 23, 24 and 27, 2020 6
7. While Police Act Section 25 states the Mayor of Vancouver chairs the Vancouver
Police Board in an ex-officio capacity without the ability to vote on Police Board
matters except in the event of a tie and cannot move board motions.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct the Mayor to write to the
Vancouver Police Board to inform the Board that while Council deeply appreciates
recent efforts to reform policing services and the efforts of the Police Department to
quickly implement related changes, Vancouver City Council’s priority is to end the
practice of street checks in Vancouver.
CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY (Vote No. 06233)
(Councillor Kirby-Yung absent for the vote due to conflict of interest)
5. Amendment to the City’s Audit Committee
June 17, 2020
The Deputy City Manager responded to questions.
POSTPONEMENT MOVED by Councillor De Genova
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
THAT Council postpone the Report dated June 17, 2020, entitled “Amendment to the
City’s Audit Committee”, and its recommendations to after the City Solicitor brings
forward a by-law on the establishment of an Auditor General to Council, expected at a
meeting of Council on or before November 30, 2020.

6. Retail Revolution: Bringing Digital Main Street to Vancouver to Support Brick and
Mortar Neighbourhood Small Business
At the Council meeting on July 21, 2020, Council referred the following motion to the Standing
Committee on Policy and Strategic Priorities meeting on July 22, 2020, in order to hear from
speakers.
The Committee heard from one person in opposition to the recommendations.

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, July 22, 23, 24 and 27, 2020 7
MOVED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. The COVID-19 pandemic has inflicted significant negative economic impact with
many Vancouver businesses forced to close or severely limit operations due to
health and physical distancing restrictions;
2. According to Statistics Canada, retail sales fell 26.4 percent to $34.7 billion in
April from March, leaving them down 33.6 percent since physical distancing
measures were implemented in mid-March. StatsCan says about one-third of
retailers were closed because of the pandemic. On average, economists had
expected a lower drop in April of 15.1 percent according to financial markets data
firm Refinitiv;
3. While essential services like grocery stores remained open, most retailers did not
offer in-store shopping in April due to public health restrictions. Online sales
surged to a record high, representing 9.5 percent of the total retail market. Many
businesses started or expanded their online presence and curbside pick-up
services in response to closures. However, many small businesses have not had
the knowledge or resources to effectively expand online;
4. Vancouver has many retail-commercial districts across the city, with 22 Business
Improvement Areas (BIAs) and roughly 15,000 small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs) within them;
5. 98 percent of Vancouver businesses are SMEs with fewer than 50 employees.
These businesses have a significant impact on Vancouver’s local economy
generating significant jobs and tax revenue. 34 percent of Provincial Gross
Domestic Product is attributable to the small business sector;
6. BIAs across Vancouver cited that up to 90% of businesses in their districts closed
– either voluntarily or due to mandatory orders – since the implementation of
restrictions to support physical distancing. Many businesses are now reopening
and struggling to adapt to the ‘new normal’;
7. Despite the easing of restrictions, small business and retail survival post-
COVID-19 is uncertain due to continued health restrictions, increased safety and
sanitation costs, economic recession, diminished consumer confidence, and
increased preference and adaptation to the convenience and safety of shopping
online;
8. A recent survey conducted by the BC Chamber of Commerce of 8,000
businesses in BC, showed 73 percent of businesses expect their revenues will
drop by 50 percent or more, with nearly a quarter saying revenues will drop by
100 percent, as a result of current restrictions;
9. Permanent closure of storefronts in Vancouver would have significant negative
impact on local employment and the vibrancy of neighbourhoods diminishing

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, July 22, 23, 24 and 27, 2020 8
complete communities, local feel, and social connection;
10. Digital Main Street (DMS) was developed to support small ‘bricks and mortar’
businesses to be more competitive in online retail through digital transformation.
DMS assists small businesses with building online presence and sales capacity
through online resources and training and one-on-one coaching;
11. Digital Main Street was created by the City of Toronto and the Toronto
Association of Business Improvement Areas (TABIA) in 2016. Funding from the
Province of Ontario followed shortly after;
12. Small business retailers and operators still face high rents while struggling with
lower customer counts. Online commerce and initiatives like DMS to augment
physical location sales will be key to small business survival;
13. The idea of bringing DMS to Vancouver and to BC led by Small Business BC is
supported by the Vancouver BIA Partnership, BIA BC as well as the Vancouver
Economic Commission and City staff;
14. Vancouver City Council and the City have a key role to play in championing and
supporting economic recovery;
15. Initiatives like room to queue and room to load that have been implemented as a
pandemic response, should be examined as a means to support a new type of
retail anticipating increased pickup activity for orders placed online;
16. If Vancouver loses our small business, we lose the strength of our local economy.
A LOCO BC survey found that spending at a local business equals 4.6X more
impact with $63 of every $100 recirculating back into the local economy vs $14
from spending at multinationals; and
17. With many small businesses on the verge of collapse, online commerce will help
the sector survive, recover and create economic resilience for future crises. DMS
is one great initiative that will need to be rolled into a larger recalibration that
recognizes the wholesale shift in retail. Supports needed for our main streets
span from taxation changes to placemaking and adjacent housing.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT the Mayor on behalf of Council write to the
Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages and the Minister of Small
Business, Export Promotion for the Government of Canada and the Minister of Jobs,
Economic Development and Competitiveness for the Province of BC stating Council’s
support for bringing the Digital Main Street Program to Vancouver and to BC, and for
Small Business BC to lead this initiative working in collaboration with Business
Improvement Associations;
FURTHER THAT the above-mentioned letter be shared with Small Business BC, the
Vancouver BIA Partnership, BIA BC and the Vancouver Economic Commission.

MOVED by Councillor Swanson
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. Officers in the Vancouver Police Department routinely respond to calls that are
related to social issues, including addiction, substance use, homelessness,
mental health issues, and poverty;
2. Officers in the Vancouver Police Department continue to respond to mental
health calls, reporting that they responded to more than 5,000 calls related to
mental health in 2019 alone;

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, July 22, 23, 24 and 27, 2020 12
3. The police budget for the Vancouver Police Department has grown more than
$100 million over the last 10 years;
4. There is widespread recognition that police officers are routinely attending to
calls that would be better dealt with by peer-, health-, social- and community-
based programming. Evidence suggests that criminalization and policing are not
effective solutions or harm reduction strategies for these concerns. This evidence
includes local communities, organizations, and residents who have called and
are calling for support for existing and future alternative approaches;
5. A number of reports have made recommendations regarding the criminalization
of Indigenous people, people who rely on public space, and people who use illicit
substances, including Red Women Rising (Martin & Walia, 2019) and Project
Inclusion: Confronting Anti-Homeless and Anti-Substance User Stigma in British
Columbia (Bennett & Larkin, 2018);
6. Recommendations from Red Women Rising include:
a. Redirect growing municipal, provincial, and federal police and prison
budgets towards solutions that increase safety for Indigenous women
such as more housing, child care, income, healthcare, mental health and
addictions services, and healing supports;
b. Repeal laws that criminalize or increase harm for women in the sex trade;
c. All levels of government must commit to using non-incarceration
measures especially for poverty-related minor offenses. Governments
must also provide sufficient and stable funding to Indigenous communities
and organizations to provide alternatives to incarceration including
community-based rehabilitation, diversion, community courts, and
restorative justice methods geared towards Indigenous women; and
d. Fund a Bear Clan Patrol in the DTES that is led by Indigenous residents
and based on Indigenous reciprocal responsibilities of safety, security,
and kinship.
7. Current policing practices disproportionately criminalize Black and Indigenous
communities, as reflected in street check data, as well as rates of incarceration in
provincial and federal prisons;
8. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada Calls to Action (2015) calls
upon federal, provincial, and territorial governments to commit to the recognition
and implementation of Aboriginal justice systems in a manner consistent with the
Treaty and Aboriginal rights of Aboriginal peoples, the Constitution Act, 1982, and
the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, endorsed by
Canada (November 2012); and Calls for Justice (2019) resulting from the final
report of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and
Girls call for decolonizing approach to justice, including 11 recommendations
specific to policing services; and
9. The City of Vancouver is committed to using an equity lens on social issues
which include issues relating to police services.

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, July 22, 23, 24 and 27, 2020 13
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council ask the police board to itemize the work they do that is related to

as well as the cost of this enforcement

and future community-based harm reduction and safety services.
C. THAT Council ask staff to report back as soon as possible with a plan, timeline
and budget to de-prioritize policing as a response to mental health, sex work,
homelessness, and substance use and to prioritize funding community-led harm
reduction and safety initiatives in these areas.
D. THAT Council directs the Mayor to inform the Vancouver Police Board that it is
this Council’s priority to respond to mental health, sex work, homelessness, and
substance use with community-led initiatives rather than policing.

FINAL MOTION AS APPROVED
WHEREAS
1. Officers in the Vancouver Police Department routinely respond to calls that are
related to social issues, including addiction, substance use, homelessness,
mental health issues, and poverty;
2. Officers in the Vancouver Police Department continue to respond to mental
health calls, reporting that they responded to more than 5,000 calls related to
mental health in 2019 alone;
3. The police budget for the Vancouver Police Department has grown more than
$100 million over the last 10 years;
4. There is widespread recognition that police officers are routinely attending to
calls that would be better dealt with by peer-, health-, social- and community-
based programming. Evidence suggests that criminalization and policing are not
effective solutions or harm reduction strategies for these concerns. This evidence

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, July 22, 23, 24 and 27, 2020 16
includes local communities, organizations, and residents who have called and
are calling for support for existing and future alternative approaches;
5. A number of reports have made recommendations regarding the criminalization
of Indigenous people, people who rely on public space, and people who use illicit
substances, including Red Women Rising (Martin & Walia, 2019) and Project
Inclusion: Confronting Anti-Homeless and Anti-Substance User Stigma in British
Columbia (Bennett & Larkin, 2018);
6. Recommendations from Red Women Rising include:
a. Redirect growing municipal, provincial, and federal police and prison
budgets towards solutions that increase safety for Indigenous women
such as more housing, child care, income, healthcare, mental health and
addictions services, and healing supports;
b. Repeal laws that criminalize or increase harm for women in the sex trade;
c. All levels of government must commit to using non-incarceration
measures especially for poverty-related minor offenses. Governments
must also provide sufficient and stable funding to Indigenous communities
and organizations to provide alternatives to incarceration including
community-based rehabilitation, diversion, community courts, and
restorative justice methods geared towards Indigenous women; and
d. Fund a Bear Clan Patrol in the DTES that is led by Indigenous residents
and based on Indigenous reciprocal responsibilities of safety, security,
and kinship.
7. Current policing practices disproportionately criminalize Black and Indigenous
communities, as reflected in street check data, as well as rates of incarceration in
provincial and federal prisons;
8. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada Calls to Action (2015) calls
upon federal, provincial, and territorial governments to commit to the recognition
and implementation of Aboriginal justice systems in a manner consistent with the
Treaty and Aboriginal rights of Aboriginal peoples, the Constitution Act, 1982, and
the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, endorsed by
Canada (November 2012); and Calls for Justice (2019) resulting from the final
report of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and
Girls call for decolonizing approach to justice, including 11 recommendations
specific to policing services; and
9. The City of Vancouver is committed to using an equity lens on social issues
which include issues relating to police services.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council ask the police board to itemize the work they do that is related to
mental health, homelessness, drug use, sex work, and the amount of money
spent on it, including the number of tickets issued from enforcing related by-laws
as well as the cost of this enforcement.

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, July 22, 23, 24 and 27, 2020 17
B. THAT Council ask staff to seek input from BLM, WISH, CCAP, BCCLA,
Hogan’s Alley Society, Vancouver Aboriginal Transformative Justice Services
Society, VANDU, PACE, DTES Women’s Centre, Western Aboriginal Harm
Reduction Society, Battered Women’s Support Services, PIVOT and the John
Howard Society, people with lived experience, equity-seeking, and other
community groups as well as housing and health providers, social service
providers and non-profit societies specializing in human rights, mental health and
addictions, about how the City could support existing and future
community-based harm reduction and safety services.
C. THAT Council ask staff to report back as soon as possible with a plan, timeline
and budget to de-prioritize policing as a response to mental health, sex work,
homelessness, and substance use and to prioritize funding community-led
groups, non-profit societies and others with the experience and training to deliver
harm reduction and safety initiatives in these areas.
D. THAT Council directs the Mayor to inform the Vancouver Police Board that it is
this Council’s priority to respond to mental health, sex work, homelessness, and
substance use with initiatives led by community, health agencies, social service
providers and non-profit societies rather than policing.
E. THAT Council direct staff to prepare a written submission with Council’s input
to the Special Committee on Reforming the Police Act, with a special focus
on how provincially funded and delivered services must be transformed in order
to successfully refocus resources at the municipal level;
FURTHER THAT Council direct staff to report back with proposed
recommendations for the aforementioned written submission in Q4 2020 or at a
time determined after consulting the Parliamentary Committee Office
regarding deadlines for written submissions.
