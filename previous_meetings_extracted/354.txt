A2. Ensuring Healthier Climate-Smart Homes
The Committee heard from four speakers in support of the recommendations, and ten speakers
in opposition.
MOVED by Councillor Carr
SECONDED by Councillor Fry
WHEREAS
1. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2023 Update for
Policymakers report states that: “Human activities, principally through emissions
of greenhouse gases have unequivocally caused global warming with global
surface temperature reaching 1.1 degrees C above 1850-1900. Global
greenhouse gas emissions have continued to increase. Widespread and rapid
changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere and biosphere have occurred.
Increasing weather and climate extreme events have exposed millions of people
to acute food insecurity and reduced water security. Impacts on some
ecosystems are approaching irreversibility. In all regions increases in extreme
heat events have resulted in human mortality and morbidity. In urban areas,
observed climate change has caused adverse impacts on human health,
livelihoods and key infrastructure”;
1
2. At least 25% of today’s global warming is driven by methane from human
actions. Pipeline-grade natural gas suitable for residential consumers is over 90
percent methane. Methane has more than 80 times the warming power of carbon
dioxide over the first 20 years after it reaches the atmosphere and 28 times
greater global warming potential than carbon dioxide on a 100-year timescale;
3. Evidence is also clear that the use of gas fireplaces and gas stoves, which burn
methane, not only contribute to global warming, but pose health risks, including
increased rates of asthma in children;
2
4. The Province of BC recently enabled local governments to establish GHG limits
for new buildings by creating the BC Zero Carbon Step Code, adding it to the BC
Building Code on May 1, 2023;
5. The director of the Zero Emissions Building Exchange (ZEBx), an industry hub
that is strengthening capacities for zero-emission buildings, has stated, “It is
without a doubt, more than possible to require almost all new buildings to meet
the highest level of the Zero Carbon Step Code today,” and that current trends
indicate that “climate-friendly and all-electric buildings will be able to be
constructed for less than what it would have cost had gas-fired equipment been
used”;
3
6. BC local governments such as Victoria, Saanich, and Burnaby have already
adopted, or are in the process of adopting, the highest step of the Zero Carbon
Step Code (“Zero carbon Performance”);

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, May 31, 2023 8
7. Vancouver’s Building Bylaw effectively prohibits the use of gas for space and hot
water in new buildings but still allows gas infrastructure connections for uses
such as gas stoves and gas fireplaces in new homes (equivalent to the “Strong
Carbon Performance” step of the BC Zero Carbon Step Code); and
8. Given Vancouver, British Columbia and Canada’s commitments to being net zero
carbon by 2050, and climate scientists’ call to immediately transition away from
fossil fuels, it makes no sense to allow building of new fossil fuel gas
infrastructure.
4
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT City Council direct staff to:
i. Report back to Council as soon as possible on a plan to update the Vancouver
Building Bylaw (VBBL) for new residential buildings, expanding the requirement
of zero emission space and water heating in new residential buildings to include
no gas hooks-ups for any purpose including cooking and fireplaces to align the
VBBL with the Zero Carbon Performance step of the BC Zero Carbon Building
Step Code.
ii. Include in future reports, policies and timelines related to zero emission retrofits
of existing buildings, requirements to phase out as quickly as possible the use of
gas for cooking and fireplaces.

SECONDED by Councillor Montague
THAT in i the words “expanding the requirement of zero emission space and water
heating in new residential buildings to include no gas hooks-ups for any purpose
including cooking and fireplaces to align the VBBL with the Zero Carbon Performance
step of the BC Zero Carbon Building Step Code.” be struck and replaced with the words
“to adopt the recently announced top step of the BC Zero Carbon Step Code to align
with the Provincial Government, Metro Vancouver, and other local government
leadership in BC.”
