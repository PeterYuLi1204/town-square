spoke in opposition of the motion, and one speaker who spoke to other aspects of the motion.
MOVED by Mayor Sim
SECONDED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. Since being elected in 2022, Council has worked with diligence and firm resolve
to reduce annual property tax increases while prioritizing affordability and
accountability in City finances;
2. A staff report to Council in spring 2025 projected that a property tax increase for
2026 in the range of 5% to 7% would be required to maintain existing service
levels, address contractual obligations, and fund long-deferred infrastructure
renewal;
3. In June 2025, Council approved a motion introduced by Mayor Sim directing staff
to prepare 2026 budget scenarios that included a zero percent property tax
increase, alongside scenarios of 1.5% and 2.5%, with an additional 1% property
tax increase for infrastructure renewal as previously directed by Council. This
Council direction was in direct response to concerns from residents and
businesses about rising costs of living;
4. Ongoing fiscal pressures facing the City include inflation, increasing salary
pressures, rising utility costs, and a significant infrastructure deficit that requires
significant long-term investment;
5. Property tax increases approved by Council of 10.7% in 2023, 7.3% in 2024, and
3.9% in 2025 have helped realign core city services and public priorities to
ensure that frontline workers and core service levels residents and businesses
expect are protected;
6. Senior levels of government have reduced grants to community organizations,
Council has acted to safeguard the City’s ongoing support for community grants,
recognizing that funding programs are essential during times of austerity and
hardship;
7. For the first time in decades, the Vancouver Police Department (VPD) and
Vancouver Fire and Rescue Services (VFRS) budgets have been fully funded to
ensure public safety. Library funding has likewise been increased to ensure this
essential City service is not only supported and but also accessible and available
city-wide; and

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services

8. Mayor Sim and Council are committed to exploring every option to reduce the
burden on taxpayers, control spending, and deliver a balanced operating budget,
without compromising the City’s ability to provide the core frontline services that
residents and businesses expect and are due.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct the City Manager and the General
Manager of Finance, Risk, and Supply Chain Management to prepare the City of
Vancouver’s draft 2026 Operating Budget, based on a zero percent property tax
increase, while prioritizing core City services and maintaining community grants, library
and community centre services;
FURTHER THAT the draft 2026 Operating Budget prepared on the basis of a zero
percent tax increase includes an allocation to infrastructure renewal that is equivalent to
one percent of the 2026 property tax levy;
AND FURTHER THAT this direction supersedes Council’s June 2025 instruction to
develop multiple budget scenarios, and instead establishes a singular focus on
achieving a zero percent property tax increase for the 2026 Operating Budget.

2. VanStat: A Pilot Program for Smart, Transparent, and Accountable City Services
The Committee heard from two speakers who spoke in support of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Zhou
SECONDED by Councillor Montague
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, October 8, 2025 10
1. The City of Vancouver delivers services that touch every aspect of daily life—
from keeping streets clean and safe, to maintaining parks and facilities, to
ensuring timely permits, emergency response, and community supports. These
services are often managed in separate departments, but residents experience
them as one city;
2. Other cities have shown that data-driven performance and accountability
systems can transform how governments deliver services. For example,
CompStat (short for Computer Statistics) was first developed by the New York
City Police Department in 1994 and has since led to measurable improvements
in governance, transparency, and safety in cities such as New York, Seattle, and
Chicago;
3. The CompStat model uses data analytics and regular accountability meetings to
monitor trends, allocate resources more effectively, and respond quickly to
community needs. While it was pioneered in policing, its principles have been
successfully adapted to broader city services, as in Baltimore, where they helped
improve service delivery and efficiency across government;
4. Vancouver has an opportunity to adapt this proven accountability framework into
a pilot program, referred to as VanStat, designed to break down silos, align
priorities, and focus on outcomes that matter to residents;
5. At the core of the model are monthly Performance Review Meetings (PRMs),
which create a predictable and disciplined cycle where departments review
progress, identify challenges, make decisions, and follow through on
commitments. This helps ensure resources are aligned to the most pressing
needs of Vancouverites;
6. During the VanStat pilot, monthly PRMs would focus on trends and results across
city services. Deliverables would include a public-facing digest, setting and
tracking of monthly targets, reporting on milestones, discussion of trade-offs,
resource reallocations, and performance on key service indicators;
7. City of Vancouver department representatives (“Accountable Owners”) such as
Deputy City Managers, Department General Managers, and relevant team leads
would participate in PRMs. Departments engaged in the pilot would include:
• Vancouver Police Department
• Facilities, Planning & Development
• Civic Engagement & Communications
• Vancouver Fire and Rescue Services
• Arts, Culture & Community Services
• Business & Economy Office
• Office of the Chief Safety Officer
• Real Estate Services
• Development, Buildings & Licensing
• Indigenous Relations
• Parks and Recreation
• Engineering Services;

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, October 8, 2025 11
8. The VanStat pilot would initially be limited to internal City departments, with the
long-term goal of encouraging external partners such as Vancouver Coastal
Health and relevant provincial ministries to join, where joint action could improve
outcomes for residents; and
9. The proposed governance structure would include the Mayor and City Manager
as Executive Co-Chairs, a VanStat Director as program lead and liaison to the
Mayor’s Office and City Manager, and an Action Log & Tracker cataloguing all
commitments, responsible owners, timelines, and performance outcomes, with a
weekly close-out rate as a key accountability measure.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to establish a three-month VanStat Pilot Program
modelled on the CompStat accountability framework, adapted for holistic city
service delivery, focused on the West-end, Downtown, Strathcona, and Mount
Pleasant neighborhoods;
FURTHER THAT the VanStat Pilot Program shall include, but not be limited to:
• Convening monthly Performance Review Meetings (PRMs) for all
participating or required departments and department leads;
• Preparing a public-facing monthly digest to share progress and outcomes
with residents;
• Implementing a governance structure with the Mayor and City Manager
as Executive Co-Chairs, supported by the VanStat Director, to oversee
pilot operations, accountability, and reporting.
B. THAT Council direct VanStat staff to report back within 3-6 months of
implementation with an evaluation of the pilot program, including
recommendations for expanding VanStat across all City departments and for the
potential inclusion of external partners such as Vancouver Coastal Health and
relevant provincial ministries.

THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. In the southeast corner of Vancouver, Champlain Heights is a masterplanned
community built by the city in the late 1970’s. The site, adjacent to a
decommissioned city landfill and largely covered in forest was at the time of
construction one of the last undeveloped greenfield sites in the city. The
neighbourhood defies the traditional street grid model, as meandering streets
and cul-de-sacs weave through ribbons of forest and trails, creating a pleasant,
wooded, car-light environment;

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, October 8, 2025 13
2. Constructed on city-owned land, Champlain Heights was modeled as a
contemporary of South False Creek with a mix of strata, social, and cooperative
housing on leasehold land, with terms ranging from 60-99 years. Mostly
constructed of low-rise wood frame structures, the community hosts diverse
incomes and demographics;
3. Champlain Heights is greatly enhanced by its forested pathways. Named after
native flora: Birch, Fir, Orange Dogwood, Grey Gum, Blue Elderberry, Black
Cottonwood, and Red Alder Trails form an extensive network of greenspace
winding through the neighbourhood (North to South from Matheson Crescent to
S E Marine Drive and West to East from Champlain Crescent to Boundary),
providing ecological benefits, robust tree canopy, natural cooling, stormwater
mitigation, and access to nature for residents and visitors;
4. The trail network is maintained by the Engineering’s Green Streets Program and
Park Board, and stewarded by local environmental non-profit, Free the Fern
Stewardship Society. With over 1,500 volunteers and thousands of hours Free
the Fern have removed 233.64 m3 of invasive plants, planted over 3,500 native
plants, and organized over 100 community events;
5. The Champlain Heights trail system provides a variety of benefits to both the
environment and the surrounding community, including: as a bird flyway, an
ecological corridor, mitigating air quality, and contributing to physical and mental
wellbeing, in a part of the city where there is otherwise and historically a relatively
limited amount of tree canopy adjacent to residential development2;
6. As part of the Vancouver Plan implementation, the City’s Social Housing
Initiative3 seeks to accelerate the delivery of non-profit-led social and cooperative
housing by streamlining the development process across the city. The report
recognizes that the Champlain Heights neighbourhood presents an opportunity to
deliver more housing and social housing options at the time of lease renewal, but
also recommends “conservation of the existing Champlain Heights forest and trail
system”, and urging that “development proposals under this initiative must
consider the existing trails, including a buffer and interface with any new
buildings”; and
7. Currently, none of Champlain Heights' verdant trail network is protected or
designated as park4. The forested pathways exist on City owned rights-of-way
where they are variously labeled as street horticulture, “Large landscaped area,”
and Garden ID 3500 (Fraserview Community Garden).

B. THAT Council recognizes the critical importance of maintaining the trail network
along with any future redevelopment as complimentary to density, livability and
urban resilience.
C. THAT Council direct staff to engage with Free the Fern Stewardship Society and
others to support complimentary resident-led stewardship of the Champlain
Heights trail network.
D. THAT Council requests the Mayor formally acknowledge and thank Free the Fern

The Committee heard from three speakers who spoke in support of the motion, and one
speaker who spoke to other aspects of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Orr
SECONDED by Councillor Fry
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. 41% of Canadians believe people like them don’t have a say in government
actions, and trust in public institutions across Canada is faltering, which risks
undermining public safety, democratic resilience, and economic well-being;
2. Data from the OECD Survey on Drivers of Trust in Public Institutions shows that
“people who feel they have a say in what the government does are more likely to
trust government”;
3. City Council meetings provide a rare opportunity to speak directly to elected
representatives, but many residents face barriers to participation, especially

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, October 8, 2025 15
people with disabilities, people in caretaking roles, newcomers, and people with
inflexible work schedules or life commitments;
4. Residents benefit from timely access to agendas and reports in order to prepare
informed comment and contribution to Council proceedings and decisions;
5. City Councillors are empowered by knowledgeable citizens that can give
meaningful and informed feedback on City Council agenda items;
6. City Council agendas frequently total hundreds of pages of reading and are often
published for public review less than a week before they are brought to Council;
7. City reports are sometimes delivered to the public with less than a week’s notice,
despite being prepared months in advance;
8. Members of the public who wish to speak to City Council experience significant
unpredictability at what time they will be called on, creating undue barriers to
participation;
9. Any residents find the process of speaking at a council meeting challenging and
intimidating, particularly people with disabilities and people who speak English as
a second language, and would benefit from improved communication and clarity
about the process to help them prepare and fully participate;
10. City Council can prioritize making public participation more accessible and
effective for working people in Vancouver, accommodating busy families, people
with disabilities, and workers; and
11. Open and accessible participation in municipal decision-making by members of
the public is a cornerstone of Vancouver’s democratic governance.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to report back with
recommendations and required by-law or procedure changes to:
1. Extend the minimum public release window for upcoming Council agendas and
supporting reports a minimum of 8 days in advance of scheduled meetings;
2. Make completed reports publicly available as soon as practicable once
finalized by staff, even prior to the release of agendas, unless restricted for
legal or confidentiality reasons;
3. Allow members of the public to give public comment at meetings of Council by
submitting a two-minute video or audio statements in advance, which can be
played during the Council meeting in place of a comment that would have
otherwise been made in person or on the phone;
FURTHER THAT Council direct staff to work with the Accessibility Committee and other
civic engagement experts to assess and improve official communications related to
public participation in Council meetings, and if needed, report back with
recommendations or procedural changes including but not limited to:

(Councillor Bligh absent for the vote)
The amendment having carried, the motion as amended was put and CARRIED
UNANIMOUSLY (Vote No.11016) with Councillor Bligh absent for the vote.
FINAL MOTION AS APPROVED
WHEREAS
1. 41% of Canadians believe people like them don’t have a say in government
actions, and trust in public institutions across Canada is faltering, which risks
undermining public safety, democratic resilience, and economic well-being;
2. Data from the OECD Survey on Drivers of Trust in Public Institutions shows that
“people who feel they have a say in what the government does are more likely to
trust government”;
3. City Council meetings provide a rare opportunity to speak directly to elected
representatives, but many residents face barriers to participation, especially
people with disabilities, people in caretaking roles, newcomers, and people with
inflexible work schedules or life commitments;
4. Residents benefit from timely access to agendas and reports in order to prepare
informed comment and contribution to Council proceedings and decisions;
5. City Councillors are empowered by knowledgeable citizens that can give
meaningful and informed feedback on City Council agenda items;
6. City Council agendas frequently total hundreds of pages of reading and are often
published for public review less than a week before they are brought to Council;
7. City reports are sometimes delivered to the public with less than a week’s notice,
despite being prepared months in advance;
8. Members of the public who wish to speak to City Council experience significant
unpredictability at what time they will be called on, creating undue barriers to
participation;
9. Any residents find the process of speaking at a council meeting challenging and
intimidating, particularly people with disabilities and people who speak English as
a second language, and would benefit from improved communication and clarity
about the process to help them prepare and fully participate;

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, October 8, 2025 18
10. City Council can prioritize making public participation more accessible and
effective for working people in Vancouver, accommodating busy families, people
with disabilities, and workers; and
11. Open and accessible participation in municipal decision-making by members of
the public is a cornerstone of Vancouver’s democratic governance.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to work with the Accessibility
Committee and other civic engagement experts to assess and improve official
communications related to public participation in Council meetings, and if needed, report
back with recommendations or procedural changes including but not limited to:
1. Publishing the number of registered speakers for each agenda item to allow
members of the public to make an informed assessment of how long
proceedings may take;
2. Communicating when Council typically breaks for meals or goes in camera,
and providing clear updates following a decision of council to recess or go In
Camera;
3. Publishing official updates on Council meeting proceedings on third-party
platforms that are accessible to people without accounts on those platforms
and safe regardless of an individual’s identity, and/or exploring options to
embed Council meeting updates on the City of Vancouver’s website;
4. Providing detailed, accurate, and plain-language communication on the
process of registering to speak at a meeting of Council, requesting additional
time for people with disabilities or people using a translator, what to expect
when participating in a meeting at city hall or by phone, and the process of
submitting written feedback;

agendas in formats that are accessible for people who use screen readers or
other access devices, and when possible, publishing plain-language
summaries of reports.
5. Next Stop UBC: A Call to Accelerate the Completion of the Broadway SkyTrain
The Committee heard from 13 speakers who spoke in support of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Maloney
SECONDED by Councillor Orr
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. The City of Vancouver has had a history of support for, and securing funding for,
the continuation of the Broadway SkyTrain to the University of British Columbia

Minutes, Wednesday, October 8, 2025 19
(UBC) and has supported all impacted residents and businesses through the
Broadway SkyTrain extension project;
2. Over 13,000 UBC students and Vancouver community members have signed the
Alma Mater Society’s petition calling on the Province of British Columbia to
release the Millennium Line UBC Extension (UBCx) business case, and for
senior governments to fully fund the project;
3. More than 61,000 of UBC’s 80,540 students, staff, and faculty commute from
offcampus; over 23,000 are City of Vancouver residents. Many already live along
the Broadway corridor, and many more are expected to move there in the coming
years as its redevelopment proceeds (UBC Campus + Community Planning,
2024);
4. With approximately 165,000 daily boardings, Broadway is the busiest transit
corridor in Canada and the United States, and the UBC Bus Exchange is the
busiest bus loop without rapid transit in Metro Vancouver. Current transit demand
already exceeds capacity; each year, the 99 B-Line bus passes-by about
550,000 riders. Multiple studies have confirmed that only SkyTrain would have
the capacity to meet the corridor’s current and anticipated ridership demands;
5. Under current projections, each morning the Broadway SkyTrain will deposit
more than 4,000 UBC commuters on the sidewalk, where they must switch to a
bus to complete their journey. This will only compound the 99 B-Line capacity
issue;
6. TransLink projects that UBCx would bring 80% of UBC students, staff, and
faculty within a one-hour commute of campus, freeing up capacity on existing
transit infrastructure, like the 99 B-Line, and reducing congestion and it
associated air and noise pollution impacts on major streets in Vancouver and
across the region;
7. The Millenium Line Broadway Extension Project’s business case recommended
studying UBCx as a standalone project (BC Ministry of Transportation and
Infrastructure, 2018). The business case is a necessary first step in the Province
of British Columbia’s financial approvals and planning process. Though the
province first committed to UBCx in 2008, it has yet to materially advance the
project;
8. In 2021 the provincial and federal governments together agreed to fund the
UBCx business case. However, the study remains incomplete with no recent
announcements or updates on its delivery timeline;
9. More than 92% of Metro Vancouver residents support UBCx. In 2022, the
Mayors' Council on Regional Transportation prioritized the project by including it
in its 10-year plan (UBC Rapid Transit, 2021); and
10. UBCx would connect residents of Vancouver and the rest of the Lower Mainland
to jobs, services, education, and cultural areas on the UBC Vancouver campus.

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, October 8, 2025 20
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council calls upon the Province of British Columbia to expedite work on
the business case for the UBC SkyTrain Extension (UBCx).
B. THAT Council calls upon the Province of British Columbia to develop and commit
to a comprehensive timeline for planning and implementing UBCx.
C. THAT Council calls upon the Province of British Columbia and the Government of
Canada to commit to funding UBCx in cooperation with TransLink, UBC, First
Nations, and other relevant local partners.
D. THAT Council directs the Mayor to write to the Premier of British Columbia, the
Prime Minister of Canada, the Federal Minister of Transportation, the Federal
Minister of Housing and Infrastructure, the Provincial Minister of Transportation
and Transit, and the Provincial Minister of Housing and Municipal Affairs to
express Council’s support for UBCx, the expedited release of its business case,
and commitments to a timeline and funding.

E. THAT Mayor and Council call upon the Government of Canada to
designate the UBCx SkyTrain Extension as a Project of National
Significance, recognizing its critical role in linking the UBC campus to the
region along one of Metro Vancouver’s busiest commuter corridors and
supporting UBC’s position as a leading centre of employment and
innovation. This designation would bring the project under the federal
Major Projects Office, helping to accelerate approvals and coordinate all
levels of government to complete the full extension to UBC as quickly and
efficiently as possible.

MOVED by Councillor Fry
SECONDED by Councillor Orr
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. Public trust in local governance is built on a foundation of clear rules, transparent
processes, and accountable leadership;
2. Vancouver City Councillors’ Oath of Office commits to abide by conflict of interest
rules under the Vancouver Charter, to carry out duties with integrity, to be
accountable for decisions and actions in the course of duties, and to perform the
duties of the office in accordance with the law;

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, October 8, 2025 23
3. The City of Vancouver established the Office of the Integrity Commissioner in
2022 to provide independent oversight, education, and advice on ethical conduct
for Council;
4. The Integrity Commissioner’s 2023 and 2024 Annual Reports identified key areas
for improvement in the Code of Conduct By-law, including compulsory education,
public reporting of non-attendance, clarity in investigative procedures, the gap in
governance of political employees, and sanction provisions for reduction in
remuneration and/or roles that enhance renumeration;
5. The independent review conducted by Reece Harding (2025) recommended ten
substantive amendments to enhance the Code’s clarity, independence, and
effectiveness, including the need for structural protections for the Integrity
Commissioner and clearer complaint procedures;
6. The BC Ombudsperson has repeatedly called for provincial legislation to
mandate enforceable municipal codes of conduct, citing Vancouver’s experience
as evidence of the risks of relying solely on local by-laws;
7. A recent August 22 ruling by the Integrity Commissioner found a majority of
Council (current/former members of ABC) were in breech of the Code of Conduct
and Vancouver Charter. However the report was ineligible of consideration for
debate, discussion, or disciplinary action because the respondents numbered
more than quorum and would otherwise recuse in conflict ruling on themselves;
and
8. The current Code lacks a robust and enforceable framework for sanctions,
particularly in cases where Council or Board Members hold authority over
disciplinary outcomes, undermining public accountability.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council endorse the recommendations contained in the 2023 and 2024
Annual Reports of the Integrity Commissioner, including:
a) Clarification of confidentiality obligations during investigations; and
b) Amending the Code of Conduct By-law to include sanction provisions for
reduction in remuneration and/or restriction from holding roles that enhance
renumeration in appropriate circumstances.
B. THAT Council directs staff to report back on ways to address the
recommendations from Reece Harding’s independent review, along with any
necessary draft amendments to the Code of Conduct By-law No. 12886 as
applicable, to address the recommendations, including:
a) Enhanced independence and structural protections for the Integrity
Commissioner;

d) Limiting public complaints to City residents and considering a refundable filing
fee;

C. THAT Council direct staff to work with the Integrity Commissioner and Legal
Services to report back within 90 days with draft amendments to the Code of
Conduct By-law No. 12886 in order to:
a) Establish a graduated sanctions regime for breaches, including:
