2. Making Turnkey Housing Units From Community Amenity Contributions More
Affordable
MOVED by Councillor Swanson
SECONDED by Councillor Dominato
WHEREAS
1. The City has hundreds of units of housing provided through Community Amenity
Contributions;
2. Many more units are planned for the future;
3. The current practice sees Community Amenity Contributions (CAC) turnkey units
leased to non-profit operators who then charge rents of about 30% at Housing
Income Limits (HILs) and 70% at low end of market (LEM) unless staff can
secure funds for more affordability;
4. This means that people with incomes below $30K can’t afford any CAC units and
people with incomes in the $30-$80K range can only afford 30% of the units, with
70% of the units going to people with higher incomes; and
5. The City is behind its targets for building lower income rental housing.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council ask staff to report back by Q4 2020 with
the following information:
a. An inventory of Community Amenity Contributions (CAC) turnkey social
housing units built, in progress, approved, and under review;
b. An inventory of what the rents in the built units are, and are expected to
be in units that are in the pipeline;
c. An explanation of what the City’s policy on charging lease payments to
non-profits who operate these turnkey social housing units is;
d. What would be the impact of charging nominal lease payments on rents;
e. What would be the impact of charging nominal lease payments on City
revenue; and
f. What the practice of charging nominal lease payments is in other
jurisdictions;
FURTHER THAT staff include recommendations for reducing lease payments in CAC
turnkey social housing units in order to increase affordability for lower income renters.

3. Open Option Parking Policy - Removing On-Site Parking Minimum Requirements
MOVED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
SECONDED by Councillor De Genova
WHEREAS
1. The City of Vancouver regulates off-street parking to balance the needs of
residents, commuters, and visitors. Parking By-law No. 6059 stipulates required
parking minimums that apply to vehicle parking spaces, loading spaces, bicycle
spaces, and passenger spaces;
2. On July 25, 2018, amendments to the Parking By-law were approved by Council
and came into effect January 1, 2019. These amendments included up to
30 percent parking reductions available to developers with submission of a
satisfactory Transportation Demand Management (TDM) plan in accordance with
the City’s TDM Administrative Bulletin, (comprising of up to 10 percent reduction
for proximity to transit, and up to 20 percent reduction for TDM measures).
Additional reductions were also enabled for rental residential developments of up
to 60 percent;
3. Vancouver’s Transportation Demand Management (TDM) Policy provides
measures to prioritize more sustainable travel as part of rezoning and/or
development permit applications;
4. The City’s Climate Emergency Response aims to have two thirds of trips in
Vancouver made by active transportation and transit by 2030 – an update from
the City’s previous Transportation 2040 goal of achieving this by 2040;
5. The City’s Climate Emergency Response six big moves aim to reduce embodied
emissions from new buildings and construction projects by 40% by 2030
(compared to a 2018 baseline);
6. Construction of underground parking is a significant source of embodied carbon
emissions. Further, the costs of excavation and concrete construction ultimately
add to the cost of housing;
7. Recently, many North American cities that have experienced growth have started
to reassess their transportation, housing, and environmental priorities. Seattle is
one such city, where changes to parking minimums were made in 2012 and
again in 2018. On-site parking minimums are now seen as a barrier to achieving
the walkable, compact, urban environments many cities aspire toward in the
21st Century and beyond;
8. Most recently the City of Edmonton – where on-site parking minimum policies
have led to a 50 percent oversupply of on-site parking – opted to completely
eliminate parking minimums under an Open Option Parking approach, whereby
the amount of on-site parking to be supplied for new developments will be

Council Meeting
Minutes, September 15, 2020 22
determined by the property owner or business based on their needs and
requirements;
9. Open Option Parking does not mean that zero or no on-site parking will be built
as part of any given development (although it is possible in some cases with the
exception of requirements for accessible parking and loading). An Open Option
Parking policy merely allows greater choice and flexibility for property owners,
developers and businesses to respond to market demand and to better
accommodate market changes while retaining adequate space for loading and
deliveries, visitors, service providers, and accessible parking needs;i
10. Adoption of an Open Option Parking policy in the City of Vancouver would
require that a number of related issues be addressed in a coordinated manner in
order to mitigate potential adverse impacts. For example, implementing
measures to better regulate curbside parking spaces and laneways in areas with
open option requirements to prevent parking spillover (i.e. to keep future
residents from simply parking on the street), while also strengthening
Transportation Demand Management requirements to reduce demand for private
motor vehicle parking and encourage sustainable transportation choices;
11. Ideally, an Open Option Parking Policy should include measures to monitor how
community needs shift and change over time to ensure that there are no barriers
to access for residents or patrons, as well as consider implementing maximum
parking allowances to align with the City’s Climate Emergency goals and ensure
that developers don’t create an oversupply of parking; and
12. If successfully adopted and implemented in the City of Vancouver, with flexibility
to meet the changing needs of residents and patrons over the long-term (e.g.
mobility vehicles, etc.), an Open Option Parking policy could lead to improved
development processes by ensuring parking supply and demand are aligned. An
Open Option Parking policy would also increase the efficiency with which
rezoning applications and development permit applications can be reviewed and
approved.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to explore the elimination of On-Site Parking Minimums
in the City and the adoption of an Open Option Parking approach/policy to allow
greater choice and flexibility for property owners, businesses and developers to
better accommodate market changes, ensure parking supply and demand are
aligned, meet loading and accessibility requirements, and increase the efficiency
with which rezoning applications and development permit applications can be
reviewed and approved by the City.
B. THAT Council direct staff to report back by the end of Q4 with recommendations
for consideration toward the implementation of an Open Option Parking Policy,
including identifying all requisite by-law amendments that would need to be
enacted, with the report to include specific information as to how an Open Option

Council Meeting
Minutes, September 15, 2020 23
Parking Policy (including consideration of parking maximums) might support
greater housing affordability and the City’s Climate Emergency bold moves.
C. THAT staff be directed to consult with relevant stakeholders in the development
of an Open Option Parking Policy, including consultation with (but not limited to)
the City’s Accessibility Task Force, Persons with Disabilities Advisory Committee
and Seniors Advisory Committee, including investigating questions such as
monitoring how community needs shift and change over time – to ensure that
there are no barriers to access for residents or business patrons that might arise
– and measures to manage curbside parking in order to control potential parking
overflow on to city streets.
___________________________
i Ensuring access for people with accessibility needs, loading and deliveries, service providers, and
visitors, is a vitally important consideration for an Open Option Parking policy. Visitor and service provider
parking has frequently been raised as a significant issue for persons with disabilities during prior
consultations.

4. Extending Pop-Up Patios This Fall and Winter and Making Pop-Up Patios a Part of
Every Summer in Vancouver
MOVED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
SECONDED by Councillor Dominato
WHEREAS
1. At the Standing Committee of Council on Finance and City Services on
May 13, 2020, Council unanimously approved the motion Flexible, Innovative
and Expedited Patio Permitting;

Council Meeting
Minutes, September 15, 2020 24
2. The motion was a direct recognition of the devastating economic impact the
COVID-19 pandemic has inflicted on the City’s restaurant sector (due to closure
periods, physical distancing requirements and the costs of additional cleaning
and safety protocols) noting that many small business operators were struggling
to survive;
3. Through the Temporary Expedited Patio Program that launched June 1, 2020, in
response to the motion, 361 permits had been issued as of August 14th, 2020,
including 291 patios on public space and 70 patios on privately owned space.
Eight permits were also issued for craft brewery patios, a first in Vancouver as
patios for breweries with a lounge endorsement had never been allowed. And
finally, nine pop-up plazas were created in partnership with local businesses and
Business Improvement Associations in neighbourhoods across the City, giving
people places to be, to gather, to rest and room to eat;
4. Pop-up patios have supported our local economy, enhanced our social fabric and
the vitality of placemaking in our City. The Temporary Expedited Patio Program
that included free permits for local businesses is slated to conclude
October 31, 2020;
5. The COVID-19 pandemic response remains in full force. Many restaurants will be
under further duress in the coming months as cooler weather arrives. A late
August survey from Restaurants Canada and the Canadian Chamber of
Commerce advised that over half of restaurants could face bankruptcy in the next
90 days, and that closure of patios would be a blow reducing needed capacity.
Employment in the sector is at record lows, and would be further decimated by
closures;
6. Also, with Fall and Winter upon us, many residents are facing increased social
isolation without the ability to be outdoors as much. Many residents are still
reluctant to dine indoors at restaurants but many are expressing interest in an
extended patio season;
7. The City has prioritized winter patio initiatives before flexing its policies in
response to circumstances such as the 2010 Olympic Winter Games when semi-
enclosed patios were allowed;
8. The responsiveness demonstrated by the City of Vancouver to adapt its policies
so quickly to support small business has been a lifeline for the sector and
demonstrated what a positive economic and social impact the City can have
when regulations and permitting are streamlined and expedited, and we are more
creative with public space;
9. A full economic recovery from COVID-19 is expected to take some time, likely
years, with no firm date for a vaccine in sight;
10. Summer is a busy season for many Vancouver restaurants. In ‘normal’ years or
pre-COVID times, there has been a shortage of patio space where people can
enjoy healthy and fun outdoor dining; and

Council Meeting
Minutes, September 15, 2020 25
11. Public response has been incredibly positive with many people commenting on
the vibrancy pop-up patios have brought to neighbourhoods by prioritizing people
and lifestyle in Vancouver’s public space. Not reverting to the ‘old normal’ but
instead building on the innovation can be a positive legacy for Vancouver in the
move towards a more vibrant and people-focused City and to operating in a new,
post-COVID world.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to extend the Temporary Expedited Patio Program
(TEPP), that included free permits for local businesses, beyond
October 31, 2020, into this coming Fall and Winter.
B. THAT extension of the Temporary Expedited Patio Program (TEPP) into this Fall
and Winter include allowance for the provision of heat sources (with priority for
electric but acceptance of propane options for this COVID response period) as
well as use of roof shelters or awnings or secured tents for weather protection (in
consultation with Vancouver Fire & Rescue Services and consideration of
accepting sign-off of structures by an independent engineer or architect) that still
provide for free airflow to support healthy dining.
C. THAT staff share the economic recovery, public and mental health imperative to
continue the Temporary Expedited Patio Program (TEPP) into this coming Fall
and Winter with the Province of British Columbia, and request a continuation of
the blanket extension given by the Province to the TEPP for expanded outdoor
liquor service within current operators’ existing allowable liquor seat allocations.
D. THAT Council direct staff to investigate the inclusion of roof shelters or awnings
or secured tents for weather protection on the pop-up plazas that were launched
in neighbourhoods across the City, and have provided valued, free commons-
style gathering and eating spaces, in order to enable them to continue to be
enjoyed by the public this coming Fall and Winter.
E. THAT Council direct staff to report back on the results and learnings from the
summer’s Temporary Expedited Patio Program by the end of 2020 (including but
not limited to info such as number and type of permits issued, response,
challenges, the use of public and private space, accessibility considerations, etc.)
as well as options for continuing a Pop-Up Summer Seasonal Patio Program
annually.
F. THAT Council direct staff to report back on allowing patios for breweries that
currently hold a lounge endorsement within the City of Vancouver on an ongoing
basis, including any considerations for aligning with Provincial guidelines in order
to streamline the different permit processes required by the City and the
Province.
G. THAT Council direct staff to report back on continuing with the creation and
expansion of pop-up plazas in more neighbourhoods across the City that provide
free, commons-style gathering and eating spaces (ensuring they are accessible

Minutes, September 15, 2020 26
to those who use wheelchairs, mobility scooters and other mobility devices and in
consultation with Business Improvement Associations) as part of Vancouver’s
rethink of public space use in a new post-pandemic world.
H. THAT staff consult with the Province of BC to share the positive response to the
Temporary Expedited Patio Program, and to explore the most effective way for
the City of Vancouver to work with the Province for expedite provincial approvals
for expanded outdoor liquor service within current operators’ existing allowable
liquor seat allocations to enable an ongoing, annual Pop-Up Summer Seasonal
Patio Program in continued support of placemaking, vibrant neighbourhoods and
small business.

5. Mental Health and Addiction Reform: An Expert-Led Cross-Jurisdictional Task
Force
MOVED by Councillor Dominato
SECONDED by Councillor De Genova
WHEREAS
1. Amid the ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic, Canada and the world are in the
grips of an ongoing mental health and addiction crisis – one that ruins health,
threatens lives, and hurts economies. The magnitude of this mental health and
addiction crisis, on a societal and on a personal level, is profoundly
overwhelming and continues to frustrate and defy most efforts to arrive at
effective solutions and achieve more successful outcomes;
2. Mental illness and addiction affect people of all ages and backgrounds. The
Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) – Canada's largest mental health
teaching hospital and one of the world's leading research centres in its field –
cites statistics that show mental illness will affect approximately 1 in 5 Canadians
in any given year, and that, by the time Canadians reach 40 years of age, 1 in 2
have – or have had – a mental illness. Approximately 4,000 Canadians per year
die by suicide – an average of nearly 11 suicides a day;

Council Meeting
Minutes, September 15, 2020 27
3. The City of Vancouver is home to residents who continue to struggle with mental
illness and/or addiction. Many lack the necessary supports within our housing
and social services systems to thrive, especially amid the societal disruption
resulting from COVID-19;
4. The City of Vancouver has taken various steps to reduce the harm caused by
alcohol and drug use – and ensure that people get treatment – without sacrificing
personal security. Council is working to:
• promote healthy families and communities and protect child development;
• make sure individuals have access to services that help them lead
healthier lives
• reduce the spread of deadly communicable diseases, and prevent drug
overdose deaths;
• recognize the need for peace and quiet, public order, and safety;
5. Much has been written, discussed, studied, announced, debated, attempted,
actioned and/or implemented over the course of several decades to address the
challenge of our city’s – and our country’s – persistent and increasingly complex
struggle with mental health and addiction issues, including the related struggle to
provide affordable, safe housing across the housing spectrum in our city.
Numerous examples of these actions, measures, plans, and strategies exist, and
many people have noted and questioned the apparent lack of effectiveness
and/or significant results flowing from past solutions and actions. Many see the
approach as fragmentary and incomplete and are calling for significant change,
particularly the need for governments at all levels to radically rethink how we
deliver social services across the spectrum;
6. A representative (though not exhaustive) list of examples of the measures and
actions taken and/or considered/recommended over the course of several
decades in response to our city’s longstanding and increasingly desperate
mental health and addiction issues ranges from the Four Pillars Drug Strategy in
the 1990s to the creation of the provincial government’s Ministry of Mental Health
and Addictions in 2017 to the more recent emergency measures surrounding the
unsafe and deadly supply of street drugs and the resulting need for greater
access to a safer supply of opioids for those suffering chronic addiction (NOTE:
an expanded list of illustrative examples is included below in the endnotes);i
7. Despite the many response efforts to-date, we continue to have people living on
the margins of life and death in our city who are in desperate need of better
supports – those who are homeless or precariously housed, some struggling with
personal trauma, untreated mental illness, addiction, and chronic health issues –
while others in our city are increasingly feeling unsafe in their neighbourhoods,
grappling with increased crime, threats and needles in parks and streets. Health
experts and police alike continue to advocate that we have a public health crisis
on our hands and as Chief Palmer recently noted, “Addiction issues should best
be handled through a health-care system, not a criminal justice system,”;
8. Members of the public, frontline service providers, advocates, police, health, and
housing leaders are increasingly and consistently calling for mental health and

Minutes, September 15, 2020 28
addiction treatment reforms that will address the urgent public health crisis, along
with the increasing public safety concerns, including:
• System navigation to connect vulnerable residents to appropriate
services;
• Integration of wraparound supports and services as part of our housing
framework;
• More treatment beds and a system for bridging the transition gap from
detox to treatment, where long waitlists are reported;
• Increased treatment and recovery pathways;
• A centralized registry to enhance information sharing between agencies
serving individuals who are homeless, accessing detox, seeking
treatment etc.;
• A full spectrum of safer supply that is accessible to all;
• Decriminalization of drugs as a public-health response;
9. On July 31, 2020, Councillor Dominato wrote to the Honourable John Horgan,
Premier of British Columbia, expressing deep concern over “The growing
challenge of homelessness, mental health, and addiction related issues in
Vancouver” and the “emerging tensions” playing out in a number of downtown
area Vancouver neighbourhoods. Her letter noted the ongoing struggle to find
effective solutions which “obliges governments at all levels to radically rethink
how we deliver social services across the spectrum.” In the letter, she made two
urgent requests of the Premier and Provincial Cabinet to consider:
• to expedite recently announced navigation centres to provide emergency
shelter and wrap around services to people who are currently in need,
and increase the proposed capacity of the centre from 60 spaces to 200
spaces;
• to support the establishment of a municipal-provincial-federal task force
on mental health and addiction, with a mandate to review the current
service delivery and outreach framework, including the interdependencies
and coordination between different levels of government;
10. In recent months, in response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen
the positive impact that all levels of government can have when they work
together with urgency, intention, and coordination. Our province has emerged as
a leader in the race against time, successfully implementing measures to flatten
our province’s COVID-19 curve. Many observers have suggested a similar
intentional and coordinated approach to mental health and addictions could be a
game changer that would save lives and create pathways to greater health and
resilience. Given the persistence and the crisis level of mental health and
addiction issues in our city, our province, and our country, it is incumbent upon
governments at all levels – now more than ever – to radically rethink how we
deliver social services across the spectrum.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Mayor and Council publicly call for, and endorse
in principle, the establishment of an expert-led cross-jurisdictional (provincial-federal-
municipal) emergency task force on mental health and addiction, the mandate of which
will be to respond to the urgent public health and emerging public safety concerns

Council Meeting
Minutes, September 15, 2020 29
manifesting in our communities and bring forward expert-informed (including lived
experience), evidence-based, non-partisan recommendations and solutions;
FURTHER THAT the task force mandate shall specifically include an examination and
review of the current service delivery and outreach frameworks, including harm
reduction, treatment, and recovery services, as well as the intersectionality of these
issues with housing, and shall include an examination and review of the coordination
between the various jurisdictions that proactively and reactively deliver these services;
AND FURTHER THAT Council direct the Mayor, on behalf of Council, to write to Premier
Horgan and Prime Minister Trudeau to seek their leadership in establishing a cross-
jurisdictional task force as outlined above.
________________________
iThe following examples are representative and illustrative (although not exhaustive) of measures and
actions taken and/or considered/recommended over the course of many decades in response to mental
health and addiction issues and the challenges that frustratingly persist:
• Under former Vancouver Mayor Philip Owen, the Four Pillars Drug Strategy was adopted by the
City in the 1990s.
• Flowing from the Four Pillars Drug Strategy, Council unanimously endorsed a drug policy
prevention plan in November 2005: Preventing Harm from Psychoactive Substance Use. The
plan was the result of extensive research and diverse community consultations and the first of its
kind at the municipal level in Canada.
• In September 2013, the City of Vancouver, the Chief Constable of the Vancouver Police
Department (VPD), and the Chair of the Vancouver Coastal Health (VCH) Board presented four
urgent recommendations to the Premier and the Ministry of Health. This was to respond to a
surge in people with severe, untreated mental illness and addictions at St. Paul’s Hospital, a
dramatic increase in people taken into police custody under the Mental Health Act, and several
violent episodes that indicated a major crisis in the health care system.
• In September 2014, the Vancouver Mayor’s Task Force on Mental Health and Addictions
completed the first phase of its work and outlined 23 priority actions in a report (Caring for All:
Priority Actions to Address Mental Health and Addictions –September 10, 2014). This report was
brought forward to Council on September 17, 2014.
• In 2016, following a significant increase in opioid-related overdose deaths from drug poisoning, a
public health emergency was declared in B.C. Since then, roughly 5,000 people have lost their
lives to overdoses across the province.
• The provincial government’s Ministry of Mental Health and Addictions was created in 2017 “to
build a seamless, coordinated network of mental health and addictions services that works for
everyone in B.C., as well as lead the response to the overdose crisis.” and in 2019 released a 10
year strategy: A Pathway to Hope: A roadmap for making mental health and addictions care
better for people in British Columbia;
• On December 18, 2018, Council approved a series of recommendations flowing from the Mayor’s
Overdose Emergency Task Force, including:

Council Meeting
Minutes, September 15, 2020 30
i. THAT Council commit the City of Vancouver to approaching the Provincial and Federal
Governments to seek their commitment to enter into a new Vancouver Agreement that
will provide an ongoing programmatic relationship and a shared commitment to a long
term approach to addressing the overdose crisis. Within the context of this agreement,
partners will work together to identify and plan changes to the health care system to
enable a robust system of continuity of addiction treatment that includes culturally safe
practices.
ii. THAT Council issue a formal statement of support for a clean drug supply and write the
provincial and federal governments in support of health care system changes to enable
this supply.
• On July 24, 2019, City of Vancouver staff presented an update to Council on the implementation
of the 31 Mayor’s Overdose Emergency Task Force recommendations approved in December
2018. The update showed completion of 14 proposed actions and progress on 16 proposed
actions to that date, as well as eight new recommendations based on the ongoing engagement
with the Vancouver Community Action Team (CAT) in response to the overdose crisis. A City of
Vancouver media release states: “Despite the focused effort to prevent overdose deaths across
the city, Vancouver continues to experience historically high numbers of drug poisonings as the
overdose emergency continues.”
• In April 2020, Health Canada proactively issued six-month class exemptions under the Controlled
Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA) to all provinces and territories to establish new temporary
Urgent Public Health Need Sites (also known as overdose prevention sites) within shelters or
other temporary sites, as needed, to help people stay safe from overdose and respect physical
distancing and self-isolation measures. The exemption provides provinces and territories with the
flexibility to choose to establish other harm reduction activities with controlled substances, such
as drug checking or virtual supervision of drug consumption to prevent overdose and overdose
death.
• On June 12, 2020, B.C.’s Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General, the Honourable Mike
Farnworth, released a statement in response to calls for reform of British Columbia’s Police Act.
His statement noted that the 45-year-old act is out of step with the provincial government’s
approach and the government’s work with police services on important issues including harm
reduction and mental health. An all-party committee is engaging with communities and experts on
how the 45-year-old act can be modernized and will examine the role of police with respect to
complex social issues including mental health and wellness, addictions, and harm reduction; and
in consideration of any appropriate changes to relevant sections of the Mental Health Act.
• On July 9, 2020, the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police (CACP) publicly called for the
decriminalization of personal possession of illicit drugs and recommended that all police agencies
in Canada recognize substance abuse and addiction as a public health issue. The CACP
endorsement of decriminalization came in response to the fentanyl crisis and a poisoned drug
supply that have devastated our communities and taken thousands of lives. CACP recommended
that “enforcement for possession give way to an integrated health-focussed approach that
requires partnerships between police, healthcare and all levels of government.” Similarly, they
stated: “The compelling case for transformative change in Canada has been made by public
health officials regarding how we respond to people experiencing a substance use disorder.”
• On July 31, 2020, Councillor Dominato wrote to the Honourable John Horgan, Premier of British
Columbia, expressing deep concern over “The growing challenge of homelessness, mental
health, and addiction related issues in Vancouver” and the “emerging tensions” playing out in a
number of downtown Vancouver neighbourhoods. Her letter noted the ongoing struggle to find
effective solutions which “obliges governments at all levels to radically rethink how we deliver
social services across the spectrum.”

Council Meeting
Minutes, September 15, 2020 31
• On August 5, 2020, the preliminary results for the 2020 Metro Vancouver homeless count were
released. The count took place on March 3 & 4 and found 2,095 residents who identified as
homeless in Vancouver (547 people were living on the street and 1,548 people were living in
sheltered locations, including emergency shelters, detox centres, safe houses, and hospitals, with
no fixed address).
• On August 20, 2020, in response to the country’s increasingly toxic illegal drug supply, the
Government of Canada announced more than $582,000 in funding over a 10 month period for an
“emergency safer supply project” to help people at risk of overdose during the COVID-19
outbreak. It will provide “pharmaceutical-grade medication to people experiencing severe opioid
use disorder and connect patients with important health and social services, including treatment,
which may be more difficult to access during the COVID-19 outbreak. Additional supports offered
include a harm reduction drop-in program, evidence-based information, supplies, food and
referrals to other service providers.”
• On August 25, 2020, the BC Coroners Service published updated reports on illicit drug toxicity
deaths and fentanyl-detected drug deaths to the end of July 2020, with 175 illicit drug toxicity
deaths reported in July – the third consecutive month with more than 170 suspected illicit drug
deaths reported to the BC Coroners Service. The Chief Coroner noted deaths due to an unsafe
drug supply continue to “surpass deaths due to homicides, motor vehicle incidents, suicides and
COVID-19 combined.” To date, there have been 909 illicit drug deaths in 2020 in B.C. This
compares to a total of 203 deaths (to August 25) in British Columbia due to COVID-19 since the
beginning of the pandemic.
On September 2, 2020, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was quoted by the CBC as saying he would not
back the decriminalization of drugs as a public-health response to the country's escalating opioid crisis.
He stated that the decriminalization approach (raised as an option by advocates and medical officials
across the country) is not a "silver bullet'' solution and further noted that the government is prioritizing
other options such as greater access to a safe supply of opioids.

and Housing in Grandview-Woodlands
MOVED by Councillor De Genova
SECONDED by Councillor Dominato
WHEREAS

Council Meeting
Minutes, September 15, 2020 32
1. The Kettle Friendship Societyi, is a non-profit organization, established
approximately 40 years ago. The organization provides many resources and
services, including a drop-in centre and supportive housing to individuals who
experience mental health challenges and addiction. Indigenous people, seniors
and homeless individuals are among the vulnerable and marginalized people
served by this organization;
2. The Kettle Friendship Society has been operating at capacity for over a decade.
The society partnered with Boffo Properties; a family-owned property
development company long established in Grandview-Woodlands. With BC
Housing included as a partner, the most recent proposal for the project was able
to secure funding to provide fifty (50) non-market and affordable housing units,
owned by The Kettle Society, a funding commitment rarely made by BC Housing
at such an early stage of a project. The proposed 15-storey development also
enabled an expanded drop-in centre for the Kettle Society;
3. Public consultation for the “Boffo Kettle Project” originally began in 2012. The
Grandview Woodlands Citizens’ Assembly formally supported this project in their
Final Report;
4. Vancouver City Council adopted The Grandview Woodlands Plan, on
July 28, 2016. The development proposed by The Kettle Boffo Plan is referenced
numerous times, including:
Subsection “Places: Commercial Drive”:
“Kettle Friendship Centre Society is a key community asset that has offered
accessible social services, including key mental health supports, to residents
living with mental illness for over 35 years. Given increasing demands for
services, Kettle’s future plan is to redevelop their existing site, perhaps together
with adjacent privately- and City-owned sites towards a larger facility to better
meet the community needs. Where possible, the City aims to support this plan to
increase access to low-barrier services.
For the purposes of this plan, this special site is defined as the area bounded by
Venables Street, the Commercial Diversion, and Commercial Drive. This
represents an overall area of about 0.3 hectares (0.75 acres). It is recognized
that future redevelopment of this overall site could occur in a consolidated
manner that incorporates several properties (and could possibly include the City-
owned land) or it could occur through a number of independent developments.
The intent reflected in the plan policies is to ensure that this special site delivers -
- as a minimum -- space for the expanded services of the Kettle Friendship
Society, as well as 30 units of non-market, supportive housing”ii
Section 7.1.2 of the plan titled “Housing” also states in the “Policies” subsection,
a further subsection “Support efforts to eliminate homelessness”, including:
“Enable the development of additional supportive housing in Grandview
Woodland. Ensure financial viability through senior government funding and/ or

provision of additional density subject to fit with neighbourhood context (e.g.
proposed redevelopment of the Kettle Friendship Society Centre at 1725
Venables Street);iii
5. June 2018, the applicant withdrew the project that was in the Rezoning
Pre-Application stage. In a letter from The Kettle Society to Mayor and Council,
Executive Director Nancy Keough stated, “we were unable to reach an
agreement with the City on a path forward in terms of the City’s financial
requirements;”iv
6. July 25, 2018, Council unanimously passed the motion titled “Support for the
Kettle Society and the City of Vancouver’s commitment to Resources for Mental
Health, Ending Homelessness and Supportive Housing”v, with direction to staff
as follows:
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council affirm support for The Kettle Society as a non-profit
organization that serves thousands of people annually and provides resources to
individuals and families facing mental health issues and homelessness in the City
of Vancouver.
B. THAT Council direct staff to work with The Kettle Society to consider potential
opportunities for The Kettle Society to move forward with their longstanding plans
to develop an expanded drop-in centre and at least 30 units of community
integrated supportive housing for individuals struggling with mental health issues
and homelessness in Vancouver;
7. Vancouver faces a homelessness and housing crisis and is in the midst of an
overdose crisis. On the frontlines for both, The Kettle Friendship Society provides
critical resources to some of the most vulnerable and marginalized people in the
city;
8. Vancouver City Council received a letter from The Kettle Society on July 6, 2020,
with an updated request. The letter also states, “The Kettle is a trusted partner of
B.C. Housing and because of that can bring 50 new, core income homes to the
city of Vancouver.” (Attached as Appendix A); and
9. Vancouver City Council unanimously supported recommendations by staff, in a
reportvi, dated June 5, 2020, to award Community Housing Incentive Program
(CHIP) Grants for the year 2020, organizations and amounts listed below:
- Finnish Canadian Rest Home Association “Finnish Care Home” - $890,000;
- Lee’s Benevolent Association of Canada “Lee’s Seniors’ Housing” $655,000;
-The Governing Council of the Salvation Army in Canada “Salvation Army”
$910,000;
- Aboriginal Land Trust Society “ALT” “Lu’ma Aboriginal Housing Society”
$6,255,000.

Council Meeting
Minutes, September 15, 2020 34
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to approach, prioritize and work with The Kettle
Society, and their partners, to revisit their most recent and desired proposal,
planned for development at Venables Street and Commercial Drive, including an
expanded drop-in mental health centre and 50 units of non-market housing to be
owned by The Kettle Friendship Society, with funding from BC Housing, in the
interest of moving forward.
B. THAT Council direct staff to identify and allocate Community Housing Incentive
Program (CHIP) Grants and/or any other option available, to meet the financial
needs of the project and satisfy any financial contributions, the City of Vancouver
requires for this project to proceed.
C. THAT Council direct staff to provide monthly updates to Council on progress staff
have made with The Kettle Friendship Society in the interest of moving forward
on an application led by this non-profit organizations and their funding and
development partners.

Council Meeting
Minutes, September 15, 2020 37
ENQUIRIES AND OTHER MATTERS
1. Potential Financial Investment in the Public Bike Share System
Councillor Kirby-Yung enquired on the status of a comment made by the City’s Chief Financial
Officer, at a past Council meeting, regarding an intended investment to be made in the public
bike share system, and what that potential dollar amount would be. The City Manager
responded by noting that the electrification of the bike share fleet has been identified in the
Climate Emergency Response and staff if exploring further. The City Manager noted that it is
still premature at this point to know the financial involvement the City would have; however,
discussions between staff and Mobi are ongoing. The City Manager assured Council that once a
dollar amount has been identified, Council would be provided an update. The City Manager also
noted that the City would need to first invest in the electrical infrastructure on the curbside.
2. Remembrance Day Ceremonies During COVID-19 Pandemic
Councillor De Genova requested an updated from staff on the communication strategy that will
be shared with the public on Remembrance Day ceremonies to be held around the city with the
new restrictions due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. The City Manager will follow up with staff and
will provide a response.
3. Public Safety in the Downtown
Councillor De Genova made an enquiry on what is the City doing, together with other partners,
to try and mitigate the large incoming concerns around public safety, especially involving young
children, in and around the Downtown. The City Manager will follow up with the Vancouver
Police Department.
4. Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with BC Housing for an Affordable Home
Ownership Program
Councillor De Genova enquired with staff on whether an MOU has been signed with
BC Housing in regards to the Affordable Home Ownership Program. The City Manager will
follow up with staff and will provide an update.

Minutes, September 15, 2020 38
6. Update on the Member’s Motion – Recalibrating the Housing Vancouver Strategy
Post COVID-19
Councillor Hardwick requested an update on the above-noted motion, which was approved by
Council on May 27, 2020, which directed staff to provide data and information, via memo, by
July 2020. Councillor Hardwick noted that a memo was received from staff; however, the memo
lacked the concrete data and only noted analysis findings and policy changes. The City
Manager noted that the memo seemed thorough and to have included the data that was
requested and asked Councillor Hardwick to email in any specific requests for data in order for
staff to address them. The Mayor offered to liaise with Councillor Hardwick and staff in order to
identify the missing data and make sure it is communicated with Council.
7. City Budget Public Survey
Councillor Boyle noted feedback received on the current City Budget public survey, in regards to
the following: the tax rate question, which is asked without context for each of the proposed
rates and what it would mean for residents and services; how the survey frames the tax rate
impact on renters; and the language used in the demographic data. Councillor Boyle wanted to
ensure staff is aware of this feedback and would like to see it integrated in future surveys. The
City Manager noted the importance of this input and that it will be recognized in future surveys.
8. Orange Shirt Day – September 30, 2020
Councillor Dominato noted that September 30, 2020, is Orange Shirt Day in Canada,
recognizing its significance in the human rights atrocities of the residential schools in Canada.
9. Update on the Operating Budget Review Practice During Election Years
Councillor Dominato requested an update on a Council Member’s Motion that was referred from
Council to staff in regards to the Council’s review of the operating budget policy practice in
election years, in order to allow Council additional time to review the budget. The City Manager
will follow up with staff and will provide a response.
10. City Enforcement of the Provincial Health Order in Regards to Restaurants
Closing Early Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic
Councillor Fry noted a recent Provincial Health Order was announced which requires
restaurants, that do not serve food, to close by 10 pm. Councillor Fry enquired with staff if there
have been any conversations with the Province on ways the City can help in enforcing these
requirements. The City Manager has engaged with the Province and discussed ways to utilize
the City’s efforts in areas that are of concern.

Minutes, September 15, 2020 39
