MOVED by Councillor Fry
SECONDED by Councillor Bligh
WHEREAS
1. President Donald Trump has threatened to impose unilateral 25% tariffs on
Canadian exports to the US, and further punitive tariffs in the event of any
Canadian retaliation, Trump’s tariffs are anticipated to destabilize the North
American trading block and Canadian economy.
2. Experts suggest Trump’s tariffs could cost the Canadian economy $275 billion in
GDP by 2030 and more than 200,000 in lost jobs.

Council Meeting
Minutes, February 4, 2025 29
3. On February 2, while proposing a temporary pause to his tariff agenda, President
Trump reiterated his desire to see Canada become part of the United States.
“‘What I’d like to see— Canada become our 51st state,’ Trump said in the Oval
Office when asked what concessions Canada could offer to stave off tariffs.” [1]
4. Prime Minister Trudeau has announced the federal government’s response to
any Trump tarrifs with phased and targeted retaliatory tariffs, and a consumer call
to action urging Canadians to “choose Canada”.
5. Provincial, territorial, municipal, regional, and First Nations governments from
coast to coast are united in a collective Team Canada approach to respond to
US economic threats and aggression.
6. Canada’s premiers have agreed to measures to strengthen internal trade and
economic cooperation, and in BC, Premier Eby has suggested Crown
Corporations halt buying American goods and services and instead buy
Canadian goods and services first.
7. In response to tariff threats the Greater Vancouver Board of Trade (GVBOT) has
challenged B.C. politicians of all political stripes to adopt a three-per-cent annual
GDP growth target.
8. The benefits of buying local are well documented, according to Canadian
Federation of Independent Businesses (CFIB), 66 cents on average stay local for
every dollar spent at a local business as the greatest share goes to procuring
goods from other local, independent businesses, while according to the
Independent BC report local businesses return 63% of revenue back in BC’s
economy compared to 14% for multi-national companies, and according to the
City’s own Retail-Commercial District Small Business Study, local independent
businesses contribute to more vibrant Local Shopping Areas and play an
important role in the livability and sustainability of the City’s neighbourhoods.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council affirms and signals the City of Vancouver supports the Team
Canada approach to align local, provincial, and national priorities as necessary to
counter foreign policies designed to harm the Canadian economy or sovereignty.
B. THAT Council directs staff to initiate an urgent high-level review of capital
projects, suppliers, procurement, and trade agreement exposure and
opportunities to Buy Local / Buy Canadian and report back as soon as possible
with immediate and long-term strategies supporting the Team Canada approach.
C. THAT Council directs the City’s Business and Economy Office to immediately
begin work with local business and community economic development
organizations (including but not limited to the BIA Partnership, LOCO BC,

FURTHER THAT the office is tasked to identify and report back with
recommendations for streamlined, transparent and nimble City regulation for
changes of use, and adaptation of business models to respond to tariffs, supply
chain disruption, and GDP growth targets.

At this point in the proceedings, Mayor Sim relinquished the Chair to Acting Mayor Meiszner to
participate in debate.
* * * * *
During discussion on the motion to postpone below, Councillor Kirby-Yung rose on a point of
order stating that Council members may only speak to the merits of the postponement and not
the motion itself. After a brief recess, Acting Mayor Meiszner ruled in favour of Councillor Kirby-
Yung and stated that Mayor Sim moved a subsidiary motion to postpone the main motion until
after a certain event or condition under section 8.5(b)(v) of the Procedure By-law, therefore, the
postponement of the motion is debatable but not the substance of the motion itself.
POSTPONEMENT MOVED by Mayor Sim
SECONDED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
THAT Council postpone consideration of the motion entitled “Choose Canada, Tariffs
and Buy Local Imperative”, until a Special Council meeting is called to address the issue
of future potential tariffs, to be held in advance of the next scheduled Council meeting on
February 25, 2025, under section 8.5(b)(v) of the Procedure By-law.

6. Consultation with the Ministry of Housing and BC Housing at a Public Meeting
Councillor Bligh submitted the following motion and prior to receiving a seconder, Councillor
Kirby-Yung called notice under Section 9.4 of the Procedure By-law. Per section 9.4(d) of the
Procedure By-law, the motion will be placed on the Standing Committee on Policy and Strategic
Priorities agenda on February 26, 2025.
MOVED by Councillor Bligh
WHEREAS
1. Council unanimously approved a plan to acquire 105 SROs with support from the
provincial and federal governments;[1]
2. 15 months ago, Council unanimously approved a motion to UPLIFT the
Downtown Eastside, which committed to updating the DTES Area Plan to deliver
“a greater number of housing including market rental, social and supportive
housing units in the DEOD to meet the needs of residents”, options to create
more below-market commercial spaces and a direction to harmonize the city’s
definition of supportive and social housing with the provinces definition, more
opportunities to provide housing choices;[2]
3. A proposed freeze (“freeze”) discussed recently at the Save Our Streets Forum
appears to contradict those goals and suspend net new supportive housing
construction indefinitely, which will decrease the supply of housing available to
Vancouverites once projects currently underway are complete;
4. Less supportive housing for low-income Vancouverites will likely increase
homelessness, mental health illness, addictions, and crime;
5. The Ministry of Housing and Municipal Affairs, with support from the Canada
Mortgage and Housing Corporation, have been working with the City to acquire
new supportive housing units; and
6. This freeze discourages new investment in housing in the city.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct City staff to invite a delegation
from the Ministry of Housing and Municipal Affairs (“GoBC”) and/or the CEO of BC
Housing and BC Housing staff to a meeting of Council, with considerations to go In-
Camera as necessary, to discuss implications of a freeze on net new supportive housing
on or before February 26, 2025;

Council Meeting
Minutes, February 4, 2025 32
FURTHER THAT staff work with GoBC and BC Housing to determine how many
supportive housing units would need to be built in Vancouver and across Metro
Vancouver to end chronic homelessness and in which municipalities those units are
needed and report back to Council.
notice
Following the calling of notice on the motion, Councillor Dominato rose on a point of order
stating that she seconded the motion prior to Councillor Kirby-Yung calling notice and sought
clarification from the Chair if procedurally that meant that the motion was on the floor and open
for debate and past the point at which notice can be called.
* * * * *
At this point in the proceedings,
MOVED by Councillor Bligh
SECONDED by Councillor Meiszner
THAT Council extend the meeting past noon to complete the agenda.
LOST
(Councillors Kirby-Yung, Klassen, Zhou, and Mayor Sim opposed)
Council recessed at 11:57 am and reconvened at 3:12 pm.
* * * * *
Following the recess, the Mayor stated that upon reviewing the recording of the proceedings
and conferring with the Clerk, the Chair did not acknowledge a seconder to Councillor Bligh’s
motion nor state that the motion was seconded, however, the Chair did acknowledge Councillor
Kirby-Yung’s calling of notice and stated that the motion would be added to the agenda of the
next Standing Committee meeting on February 26, 2025. The Chair also stated that the
Procedure By-law is silent on when a matter is on the floor for debate and the Clerk referred to
section 4:3 of Robert’s Rules of Order which states that neither the making nor the seconding of
a motion places it before the assembly, only the Chair can do that by a third step of stating the
question. As such, the Mayor ruled that because the Chair did not state the question on the
floor, the motion was not yet open for debate despite members of Council calling to second the
motion.
Subsequently, Councillor Bligh rose on a point of order to clarify the ruling and inquired whether
the calling of notice on a motion was debatable. The Mayor cited section 9.4(c) of the Procedure
By-law that states, “the calling of the notice is not debatable”.
Councillor Bligh then rose on another point of order and enquired if a delegation of BC Housing
or the Ministry of Housing would be bound by the same 3-minute time limit as public speakers.
The Clerk affirmed that under section 7.5(a) of the Procedure By-law, they would have 3
minutes to speak.

Council Meeting
Minutes, February 4, 2025 33

2. Vancouver Coastal Health – Mental Health Nurses
Councillor Dominato noted the recent round table meeting that several Council members
