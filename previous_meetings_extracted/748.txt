On October 6, 2020, Council referred the above-noted motion to the Standing Committee on
Policy and Strategic Priorities meeting on October 7, 2020, in order to hear from speakers.
The Committee heard from three speakers in support of the motion.

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, October 7, 8 and 15, 2020 13
MOVED by Councillor Swanson
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. Under the guidelines set forth by Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry,
British Columbians have been strongly encouraged to practice physical
distancing with all but one’s own household. Social distancing is particularly
difficult for seniors, under housed individuals, and those who live alone. It has
become clear that pets can help ease this isolation;
2. COVID-19 has exacerbated an already existing problem: the current legislation
discriminates against renters that have pets and are trying to find affordable
housing in BC. The BC SPCA reports that “no pets” policies are the leading
cause for surrender and abandonment of pets;
3. Ontario prohibited “no pets” policies in rental units, and this law has brought
benefit to renters and pets for decades in Ontario. As the two provinces face
similar pressures in rental housing, this model could be studied and applied
within BC; and
4. The Renters’ Advisory Committee has asked its liaison councillors to bring
forward this resolution.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council ask the Mayor to advocate to the
province for the prohibition of “no pets” clauses in rental contracts, and ask staff to
look into what mechanisms the City can use to curb landlords’ right to refuse rental on
the basis of pet ownership.
CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY (Vote No. 06490)
(Councillors Bligh and Dominato absent for the vote)
8. Rent Forgiveness Program (Member’s Motion B.3)
On October 6, 2020, Council referred the above-noted motion to the Standing Committee on
Policy and Strategic Priorities meeting on October 7, 2020, in order to hear from speakers.
The Committee heard from one speaker in support of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Swanson
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. The City of Vancouver’s Renters Advisory Committee has been watching City
and Provincial support for renters closely during the COVID-19 State of
Emergency in BC;
2. Many renters have lost income during this time, and as a result have struggled to
pay their rent, and that this is particularly true in Vancouver, where according to
the 2016 census 35% of renter households spend 30-99% of their income on
housing;

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, October 7, 8 and 15, 2020 14
3. The Committee is thankful that the BC government has announced (to date) that
they will continue to ban evictions for non-payment of rent until August 31st,
however, despite both provincial and federal financial assistance programs, there
are many renters in Vancouver who are struggling to pay for housing (while also
paying for other necessities);
4. Rents have not been forgiven, only delayed, even for those hardest hit by the
pandemic;
5. Due to unemployment, among other factors, many renters will not be able to pay
the accrued rent amount once the eviction ban is lifted, even with a provincial
payment plan in place;
6. Loans from a “rent bank” to cover arrears, which must be paid back, can also put
many renters are at risk of ruinous rent debt through no fault of their own; and
7. The Renters’ Advisory Committee has asked its liaison councillors to bring
forward this resolution.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council ask the Mayor to advocate for a rent
forgiveness program to the Government of British Columbia for those who cannot pay
their full rent due to financial impacts from the COVID-19 Pandemic;
FURTHER THAT accrual of further debt through “rent banks” are acknowledged as an
unacceptable solution to missed rent payments due to the COVID-19 Pandemic.
CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY (Vote No. 06491)
(Councillors Bligh and Dominato absent for the vote)
9. Ensuring Equity for Speakers Using Translation (Member’s Motion B.4)
On October 6, 2020, Council referred the above-noted motion to the Standing Committee on
Policy and Strategic Priorities meeting on October 7, 2020, in order to hear from speakers.
The Committee heard from one speaker in support of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Swanson
WHEREAS
1. The City of Vancouver is committed to using an equity lens on social issues;
2. Vancouver is one of the most linguistically diverse cities in Canada;
3. The Procedure By-law No. 12577 - which outlines procedures for Council
meetings, including speakers-limits all speakers to five minutes;
4. Therefore, speakers using translation must share their thoughts, experiences,
and concerns in a shorter amount of time than those not using translation;
5. This limits the amount that Council can hear from speakers who use translation
and who may be directly impacted by Council decisions;

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, October 7, 8 and 15, 2020 15
6. This inequity has been raised by speakers before Council who are or who work

7. The City of Vancouver’s 2010 Seniors in Vancouver report states that
“Vancouver’s diversity means that both government and community services
need to [...] provide enhanced supports to address language and cultural
barriers”.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to prepare for

10. Calling on the Federal and Provincial Governments to Make Emancipation Day an
Official Holiday (Member’s Motion B.5)
On October 6, 2020, Council referred the above-noted motion to the Standing Committee on
Policy and Strategic Priorities meeting on October 7, 2020, in order to hear from speakers.
As the registered speakers were not available, the Committee began debate and decision.
MOVED by Councillor Swanson
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. The City of Vancouver recognized August 1 as Emancipation Day this year;
2. Emancipation Day recognizes the day that slavery was officially ended in the
British Empire in 1834 before Canada was a separate country from Britain;

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, October 7, 8 and 15, 2020 16
3. On August 1, 1834, only enslaved children below the age of six were freed.
Enslaved people older than six years of age were “assistants” and required to
work 40 hours per week without pay, as part of compensation payment to their
prior owners. Full release from slave labour happened at 12 PM on
July 31, 1838, just about four years later;
4. Making Emancipation Day a federal holiday would help confront the legacy of
slavery and white supremacy. As recent months have shown, this is something
our country and society sorely needs;
5. Canadian history is taught in schools from a Eurocentric viewpoint that overlooks
or minimizes the human rights infringements against Black and Indigenous
people, while students learn about white European explorers rather than the
Black and Indigenous people they enslaved and colonized;
6. A major piece of recognizing Emancipation Day is discussing the numerous
areas of Canada's past that regularly don't make it into the "typical" history-class
educational program;
7. Even after emancipation, Black people were and are targeted with discrimination,
prejudice, and murder;
8. Emancipation Day is also about reflecting on our present, taking the time to
examine the current circumstances and remembering why Black lives matter and
what concrete steps we can take to end systemic racism;
9. Emancipation Day is about learning Canada’s collective history - not rewriting
that history but telling a more complete history that includes the history of slavery
and systemic discrimination;
10. Emancipation Day questions why slavery happened in the first place, and it is
also about fighting to end systemic racism for this and future generations;
11. Recognizing Emancipation day helps teach the next generation about the
shameful parts of the past that must not be repeated;
12. Slavery and segregation created circumstances of marginalization, a cycle of
unequal access, lost opportunities and systemic poverty. Even after slavery was
abolished in Canada, Black people continue to be devalued with subpar health
care, education and lack of employment opportunities. Communities were legally
segregated, creating significant barriers to economic success; and
13. As the City’s Emancipation Day proclamation acknowledged, local Black
communities have worked and continue to work to bring awareness to these
present and historical realities, and there is a contemporary campaign to declare
a National Emancipation Day in Canada.

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, October 7, 8 and 15, 2020 17
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT City Council direct the Mayor to write to the Province of British Columbia to
call for Emancipation Day on August 1st to be recognized as a holiday.
B. THAT City Council direct the Mayor to write to the Government of Canada to call
for Emancipation Day on August 1st to be recognized as a holiday.

MOVED by Councillor Carr
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. The scientific consensus is clear that human activities are primarily responsible
for accelerating global climate change, and that the climate crisis now represents
one of the preeminent threats to global civilization;
2. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reported in 2018 that we must
achieve net zero in greenhouse gas emissions by the middle of this century in
order to have a reasonable chance of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees
Celsius;

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, October 7, 8 and 15, 2020 18
3. Changes in Vancouver’s climate are already being felt through hotter, drier
summers, increased exposure to wildfire smoke, warmer, wetter winters, and with
rising sea levels;
4. Our entire community is impacted by the health and safety risks of fossil fuel
expansion, particularly those who also face socioeconomic and health inequities,
including low-income families, those experiencing homelessness, People of
Colour and Indigenous people, youth, seniors, those experiencing mental and
physical disabilities, and people with health conditions;
5. Our youth and future generations have the most to lose from a lack of immediate
action to stop fossil fuel expansion as they face major and lifelong health,
ecological, social, and economic impacts from prolonged and cumulative effects
of climate change, including food and water shortages, infectious diseases, and
natural disasters;
6. The Paris Climate Agreement is silent on coal, oil and gas, an omission with
respect to the supply and production of fossil fuels (the largest source of GHGs)
that needs to be collectively addressed by other means; and
7. Global governments and the fossil fuel industry are currently planning to produce
about 120% more emissions by 2030 than what is needed to limit warming to
1.5°C and avert catastrophic climate disruption, and such plans risk undoing the
work of our city to reduce GHG emissions;
8. The fossil fuel industry is currently claiming over 50% of COVID recovery funding
from senior levels of government in the G20, thereby siphoning away recovery
funding badly needed by cities and other industries;
9. The construction of new fossil fuel infrastructure and expanded reliance on fossil
fuels exposes communities to untenable risks to public health and safety at the
local and global levels;
10. The economic opportunities presented by a clean energy transition far outweigh
the opportunities presented by an economy supported by expanding fossil fuel
use and extraction;
11. Our community is committed through our Climate Emergency Response to a just
energy transition and to appropriate investments that offset the impacts of
evolving industries and employment as well as appropriate investments that are
needed to respond to current climate impacts and reduce future climate change;
12. The City of Vancouver recognizes that it is the urgent responsibility and moral
obligation of wealthy fossil fuel producers to lead in putting an end to fossil fuel
development and to manage the decline of existing production; and
13. A new global initiative is underway calling for a Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation
Treaty that would end new fossil fuel exploration and expansion, phase out
existing production in line with the global commitment to limit warming to 1.5°C,
and accelerate equitable transition plans.

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, October 7, 8 and 15, 2020 19
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT the City of Vancouver formally endorses the call
for a Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty;
FURTHER THAT the Mayor, on behalf of Council and the City of Vancouver, send a
letter from the Mayor to the Prime Minister of Canada and the Premier of B.C. urging the
Canadian and B.C. governments to support the global initiative for a Fossil Fuel
Non-Proliferation Treaty;
FURTHER THAT staff be directed to consider actions in the Climate Emergency Action
Plan to reduce fossil fuel supply within Vancouver’s jurisdiction, such as supporting
conversion of the energy supplied by gas/diesel stations and the fossil (natural) gas
distribution system to low carbon alternatives;
AND FURTHER THAT the City of Vancouver affirms its ongoing commitment to the goals
of the Paris Climate Agreement and the Green House Gas (GHG) reduction targets as
called for by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and aspires to
meet its proportionate greenhouse gas reductions.
CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY (Vote No. 06493)
12. A Closer Look at Tiny Homes and Shelters (Member’s Motion B.7)
On October 6, 2020, Council referred the above-noted motion to the Standing Committee on
Policy and Strategic Priorities meeting on October 7, 2020, in order to hear from speakers.
The Committee heard from two speakers in support of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Fry
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. Vancouver faces a scarcity of affordable housing;
2. Through work on City Wide Plan, Housing Vancouver Strategy, and Making
Room Housing Program the City of Vancouver seeks to add more housing
choices to accommodate a broad range of incomes, occupations, and
households at all stages of life across the city;
3. Tiny homes and shelters are small single dwellings, typically under 50 m2, and
constructed to facilitate affordability and environmental sustainability. Typology
includes:
a. Mobile tiny homes, typically factory-built on trailer beds and often certified
as Recreational Vehicles afford a degree of portability and thus aren’t site
dependent (example: Vancouver-based manufacturer Mint Tiny Homes
https://www.minttinyhomes.com);
b. Fixed tiny homes, typically built as detached or semi-detached structures
on a slab or post and pier foundation allow for more site-specific and
custom construction options. (example: Tiny Society: Tiny Houses on
Foundations https://www.tinysociety.co/articles/tiny-houses-on-

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, October 7, 8 and 15, 2020 20
foundations);
c. Temporary modular shelters, are built from pre-fabricated components
that can be deployed rapidly and relatively inexpensively, with beds,
wiring, insulation, egress and security often for just a few thousand
dollars. (example: Seattle-based Pallet Shelter
https://www.palletshelter.com);
4. Tiny homes and shelters have been enabled in other jurisdictions on private and
public land; in partnership with NGO, community, and religious groups; and in
market, co-op and supportive housing models to provide a vital part of the
housing continuum, and often as an affordable, practical and rapid deployment
option for under housed populations;
a. Opportunity Village in Eugene, Dignity Village in Portland Oregon are
successful examples of intentional transitional communities of tiny houses
on public land, with congregate kitchen, bathroom and shower facilities
that provide a housing first solution for people facing homelessness.
(http://www.vancouversun.com/life/Pete+McMartin+Portland+micro+appr
oach+housing+homeless/10329522/story.html);
b. Homes for Heroes Foundation has built a fifteen unit co-housing model
for homeless veterans in Calgary. (https://www.businessinsider.com/tiny-
home-village-for-homeless-veterans-calgary-canada-2019-11);
5. In Vancouver, the construction of shelters and dwelling units, whether built on
site or in a factory are variously regulated by:
a. The National Building Code of Canada;
b. Canadian Standards Association (CSA);
c. BC Building Code (BCBC); and
d. Vancouver Building By-Law 12511;
6. In Vancouver, the regulation of land-use, development permit requirements and
establishment of zoning districts are variously regulated by the Zoning and
Development By-Law 3575;
7. Currently, neither the Vancouver Building By-law 12511 nor the Zoning and
Development By-law 3575 support the building and permitting of tiny homes or
shelters;
8. Some code authorities and local governments are revisiting their respective
building by-law codes to better support tiny homes and shelters. Building codes
for on-site and factory built tiny homes and shelters variously provide for
minimum floor space, room size, life safety, anchorage or foundation, climate
control and building envelope. Some jurisdictions have modernized their building
codes to support the construction of tiny homes and shelters, for example:
a. International Residential Code (2018) - Appendix Q: Tiny Houses
https://codes.iccsafe.org/content/IRC2018/appendix-q-tiny-

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, October 7, 8 and 15, 2020 21
houses?site_type=public
Advises Maximum size (37 m2), emergency escapes and rescue
openings, headroom, lofts and stairs, etc;
b. Ontario Building Code “Build or Buy a Tiny Home” (2019)
https://files.ontario.ca/mmah_tiny_homes_en_20191129.pdf
Advises Minimum size (17.5 m2) and building standards;
9. Local governments are revisiting their respective zoning policies to better support
tiny homes and shelters. Zoning policies to support tiny homes and shelters
variously accommodate new land use models and building forms. Some
jurisdictions have modernized their zoning regulations to support the permitting of
tiny homes and shelters, for example:
a. San Diego “Movable Tiny Houses Municipal Code Amendment” (2020)
https://www.sandiego.gov/sites/default/files/dsd_pc_20-
017_movable_tiny_houses.pdf;
Amendments to San Diego Municipal Code to support “Companion units,
junior units, and movable tiny houses” in Residential, Agricultural-
Residential zones and in specific district regulations;
b. City of Edmonton enables ‘tiny homes’ through zoning by-law change
(2019)
https://canada.constructconnect.com/joc/news/government/2019/12/city-
of-edmonton-enables-tiny-homes-through-zoning-bylaw-change
New zoning regulations to permit tiny home communities and infills as a
“missing middle” housing allowance;
10. In June 2019, Council unanimously passed the motion “Transparent Process and
Taxation for Land Banks Repurposed as Temporary Recreational Properties”
with direction for staff to report back with recommendations for conditional
conversions of development sites for temporary use as “recreational property.”
BC Assessment classifies land according to its use, and the city applies a mill
rate to the classification to determine taxes, for example:
a. The 2020 mill rate for Class 6 Business, other is $6.73 per $1,000 of
assessed value;
b. The 2020 mill rate for Class 8 Recreational Property, Non-profit
Organization (Community Gardens) is $2.63 per $1,000 of assessed
value;
c. The 2020 mill rate for Class 3 Supportive Housing (Cabinet designation,
for people homeless or at risk of homelessness) is $0.14 per $1,000 of
assessed value;
11. On September 14 2020, Council directed staff to report back on the feasibility
and costs of options to accelerate the creation of emergency housing for
homeless Vancouver residents, including “Establishing temporary tiny house
villages on vacant public or private land”.

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, October 7, 8 and 15, 2020 22
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct the Office of the Chief Building Official (CBO) and General
Manager of Planning, Urban Design, and Sustainability to report back with
analysis for potential implementation of Tiny Homes and Shelters.
B. THAT Council direct staff to report back with recommendations of possible
changes to Building By-law to support tiny homes and shelters, that consider:
i. Minimum and maximum sizes, life safety and livability;
ii. Options for congregate settings and shared facilities like showers,
washrooms and kitchens; and
iii. Options for mobile, fixed, and temporary modular tiny homes and
shelters.
C. THAT Council direct staff to report back with recommendations of possible
changes to Zoning and Development By-law, that consider:
i. Temporary and semi-permanent location of Tiny Homes and Shelters in
R-, C-, and I- zones;
ii. Options for infill and secondary units; and
iii. Options for mobile units in parking lots.
D. THAT Council direct staff to report back with any legal and public engagement
considerations that include:
i. Options for temporary zoning of vacant pre-development sites that might
facilitate their use as tiny house villages and facilitate their property
assessment as Class 3 - Supportive Housing, or Class 8 - Recreational
not for profit, much like the current practice of temporary community
gardens on vacant pre-development sites; and
ii. Best practices and obligations for public engagement on respective
zoning and by-law changes, as well as any specific permanent and
temporary installations.

13. Improving the Circularity of Vancouver’s Economy (Member’s Motion B.8)
On October 6, 2020, Council referred the above-noted motion to the Standing Committee on
Policy and Strategic Priorities meeting on October 7, 2020, in order to hear from speakers.
The Committee heard from 14 speakers in support of the motion.

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, October 7, 8 and 15, 2020 28
MOVED by Councillor Wiebe
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. According to the World Economic Forum, a circular economy is an industrial
system that is restorative or regenerative by intention and design. It replaces the
end-of-life concept with restoration, shifts towards the use of renewable energy,
eliminates the use of toxic chemicals, which impair reuse and return to the
biosphere, and aims for the elimination of waste through the superior design of
materials, products, systems, and business models;
2. Indigenous peoples have lived according to such concepts for thousands of
years, abiding by laws of nature relating to tides and seasons, waters and
ecosystems to ensure longevity, abundance and reciprocity;
3. Cities around the world have adopted citywide circular strategies, including Paris,
London, Seoul, Copenhagen, Rotterdam, Helsinki, Brussels, Tel Aviv, and Cape
Town. For the City of Vancouver, improving circularity could offer a post-COVID
“solution to the growing problem of waste, while also offering an opportunity to
generate economic growth, increase the number of local green and inclusive
jobs, encourage innovation, reduce GHG emissions, and contribute to the city’s
goal to be the greenest city in the world.” [i]
4. According to the Ellen Macarthur Foundation, there are various policy measures
city governments can use to bring about circular economy transitions including,
urban planning, regulations, public procurement, capacity building, engagement,
awareness raising and financial support. These policies are “underpinned by a
transition to renewable energy sources, the circular model builds economic,
natural, and social capital. It is based on three principles: design out waste and
pollution; keep products and materials in use; regenerate natural systems.” [ii];
5. Key circular economy strategies include reuse and repair models, waste
minimization and elimination, circular supply-chains, materials recovery, product
life extension, more efficient use of goods and assets, renewable energy
generation, blue-green infrastructure, and technological innovations. Many
departments in the City have already successfully implemented circular models
in their operations such as generating energy from our sewage, asphalt recovery,
and gas capture from landfill to power City vehicles;
6. Vancouver is one of the signatories of C40 Cities and has committed to the
following goals to help move towards circularity:
a. Reduce the municipal solid waste generation per capita by at least 15%
by 2030 compared to 2015;
b. Reduce the amount of municipal solid waste disposed to landfill and
incineration by at least 50% by 2030 compared to 2015;
c. Increase the diversion rate away from landfill and incineration to at least
70% by 2030;

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, October 7, 8 and 15, 2020 29
7. Council approved the Climate Emergency Action Plan, Healthy City Strategy, and
the COVID Recovery Plan, all of which identify the need for local, sustainable,
circular models to address the current climate crisis, enhance local food security
and bolster economic recovery;
8. The City of Vancouver continuously updates its Green Demolition by-law to
increase the rate of deconstruction, reuse, recycling, and salvaging of building
materials such as old growth lumber;
9. Council approved the False Creek Flats Plan and the Flats Economic
Development Strategy on May 17, 2017, that includes recommendations for
enhancing circular economy activity in this central industrial area to increase
resilience, shorten supply chains, adopt innovative solutions, densify industrial
lands, decrease long range transportation needs, and increase green jobs;
10. Recently Metro Vancouver Board of Directors unanimously passed the region’s
Industrial Land Strategy and Council approved the motion Accelerating Action on
Industrial Affordability that directed staff to undertake actions that will serve to
protect the loss of industrial land in the city, improve accessibility and affordability
of industrial spaces, support greater circular economy activity; and
11. Growing evidence shows that the transition to a more circular economy drives job
growth, specifically green and inclusive jobs, because managing and handling
materials for reuse requires manual labour and more complex processes than
simply landfilling or incineration of waste resources; “for every 10,000 tonnes of
resources that is recycled instead of being incinerated, 36 additional jobs are
created.” [iii].
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to prioritize the following
circular principles and objectives in citywide decision making and include this information
in reports to Council:
i. Design out waste and pollution;
ii. Keep products and materials in use;
iii. Regenerate natural and Indigenous systems;
FURTHER THAT Council direct staff to:
i. Collaborate with local First Nations and urban Indigenous communities to
apply learnings of decolonization in designing circular policies and models
that work in balance with the natural world;
ii. Apply the objectives of the circular economy to prioritize steps and projects
that align with existing City of Vancouver policies, strategies, and actions;
iii. Report annually to Council, with the VEC, on progress made toward a circular
economy through ongoing City policies, strategies, and actions. The report
should include identification of areas, policies and programs that would
benefit from additional attention, be it staffing, resourcing, new partnerships,
or other forms of support that would serve to grow or accelerate circularity;

iv. Work with VEC to track and record circular economy strategies, policies, and
programs in other jurisdictions and Nations that can serve as inspiration for
advancing Vancouver’s circular economy; the record should include
intelligence from C40, World Circular Economy Forum, Sitra (Finland),
Federation of Canadian Municipalities, Circular Economy Solutions Series
(from Delphi Group), The Natural Step Canada, Circle Economy, and more
as identified over time;
v. Support and facilitate ongoing circular work and models being delivered by
local green innovators, First Nations, businesses, and organizations,
including: de-construction hub, local food rescue and food waste recovery,
share repair reuse models, materials recovery hubs, textile recovery,
refurbishing, material repurposing and refurbishing;
vi. Explore COVID-19 Recovery opportunities with other orders of government to
identify economic and funding opportunities to increase circularity in
Vancouver, such as training, skills development and employment
opportunities for individuals experiencing barriers to meaningful employment;
integrated localized energy, waste and water management systems,
materials recovery and conversion.

UNANIMOUSLY (Vote No. 06501).
FINAL MOTION AS APPROVED
WHEREAS
1. According to the World Economic Forum, a circular economy is an industrial
system that is restorative or regenerative by intention and design. It replaces the
end-of-life concept with restoration, shifts towards the use of renewable energy,
eliminates the use of toxic chemicals, which impair reuse and return to the
biosphere, and aims for the elimination of waste through the superior design of
materials, products, systems, and business models;
2. Indigenous peoples have lived according to such concepts for thousands of
years, abiding by laws of nature relating to tides and seasons, waters and
ecosystems to ensure longevity, abundance and reciprocity;
3. Cities around the world have adopted citywide circular strategies, including Paris,
London, Seoul, Copenhagen, Rotterdam, Helsinki, Brussels, Tel Aviv, and Cape
Town. For the City of Vancouver, improving circularity could offer a post-COVID
“solution to the growing problem of waste, while also offering an opportunity to
generate economic growth, increase the number of local green and inclusive
jobs, encourage innovation, reduce GHG emissions, and contribute to the city’s
goal to be the greenest city in the world.” [i]
4. According to the Ellen Macarthur Foundation, there are various policy measures
city governments can use to bring about circular economy transitions including,
urban planning, regulations, public procurement, capacity building, engagement,

MOVED by Mayor Stewart
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. Affordable rental units across Vancouver are being lost due to the practice
of renovictions, leaving tenants with limited options in finding a similar unit at the
previous rent, particularly after many years living in the same rental home;
2. The practice of renovictions disproportionately impacts elderly, low income
families and new immigrants, creating housing insecurity, loss of affordable rental
units and potential homelessness;
3. The British Columbia Rental Housing Task Force from December 2018
recommends stopping the practice of renovictions, identifies the current
Residential Tenancy Act as having a lack of clear guidance and leaving “renters
vulnerable to misinterpretation or abuse of the Act”, and identifies an opportunity
for local governments to amend legislation and recommend policies; and
4. In February 2020, BC’s Supreme Court upheld New Westminster’s by-law aimed
at discouraging renovictions, concluding that municipal governments can pursue
by-laws to discourage bad faith renovictions and fine landlords.

during major repair or renovation on their unit;
b. Requirement that owners honour original tenancy agreement terms when
tenant returns to the unit;
c. A structure of penalties for owners who fail to meet the above
requirements, including fines;
d. Exploring financial mechanisms to support owners by incentivizing the
