Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, November 16 and 22, 2022 8
CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY AND
BY THE REQUIRED MAJORITY
* * * * *
MOVED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
WHEREAS
1. The City of Vancouver is committed to advancing reconciliation, equity, and
anti-racism for all people in Vancouver and committed to combatting all forms of
hatred, including antisemitism. The City continually strives for improvement and
to work toward a fairer, safer, more inclusive city;
2. January 27 is designated by the United Nations General Assembly as
International Holocaust Remembrance Day; i
3. On May 26, 2016, the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance Plenary, of
which the Government of Canada is a permanent member, adopted the working
definition of antisemitism and its list of illustrative examples;
4. On June 25, 2019, the Government of Canada adopted the International
Holocaust Remembrance Alliance working definition of Antisemitism (IHRA
Definition of Antisemitism);
5. At the July 23, 2019, regular Vancouver City Council meeting, a motion was
introduced calling for the City to adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance
Alliance (IHRA) non-legally binding working definition of antisemitism and list of
illustrative examples (“Combatting Antisemitism in Vancouver”);
6. The motion (“Combatting Antisemitism in Vancouver”) was referred to the City’s
Racial and Ethno-Cultural Equity Advisory Committee to provide
recommendations to Council on how the City of Vancouver can increase action
to combat all forms of racism and hatred, including Antisemitism, with further
direction to staff to work with the Racial and Ethno-Cultural Equity Advisory
Committee and report back with recommendations “as soon as possible, or by
early 2020.”; ii
7. Every person in the City of Vancouver has the right to realize their potential
without fear of discrimination, and to live in conditions of dignity, respect; and
peace;
8. Antisemitism is on the rise around the world, and antisemitic and anti-Jewish
hate has flourished in the digital age;
9. Statistics Canada reports that members of the Jewish community are the most
frequently targeted religious minority group when it comes to police-reported hate
crimes in 2021. Anti-Jewish hate crimes include beatings, vandalism of
synagogues, racist slurs, harassment, intimidation and the plastering of
swastikas at schools;

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, November 16 and 22, 2022 9
10. In response to the rise of antisemitism and anti-Jewish hate crimes, on July 21,
2021, the Government of Canada and the Honourable Irwin Cotler, Canada’s
Special Envoy on Preserving Holocaust Remembrance and Combatting
Antisemitism, convened the National Antisemitism Summit to identify ways in
which organizations, communities, individuals, and the federal government can
work together to increase public awareness, enhance community security,
combat misinformation and online hate and identify new measures necessary to
combat antisemitism;
11. In June 2022, the Province of BC started working with the International Holocaust
Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) non-legally binding working definition of
antisemitism. In a letter sent to the Pacific region office at the Centre for Israel
and Jewish Affairs (CIJA) in Vancouver, BC Premier John Horgan wrote:
“Our government understands that systemic racism looks different for different
communities and that it can change over time.… We also understand that to
effectively combat one of the world’s oldest forms of hatred, we must first clearly
identify it. In this light, we see the IHRA definition as an important non-legally
binding educational tool to help us determine what is and what is not antisemitic,
which allows us to work toward a society that is better for all British Columbians.”
12. More recently, on October 14, 2022, the Government of Canada reiterated its
strong condemnation of the alarming rise of antisemitism at home and abroad
and committed to countering online antisemitism by introducing new legislation,
along with strengthening the Canada Human Rights Act and the Criminal Code;
13. The City of Vancouver website states: “As we continue to develop our anti-racism
and equity strategies to ensure that Vancouver is a more inclusive and fair place,
it is more important than ever that the lessons learned and the horrors of the
Holocaust remain present in the public consciousness so they are never
repeated.”; iii
14. To date, and in the face of the alarming global increase in antisemitism and
anti-Jewish hate and the significant and meaningful actions taken by the federal
and provincial governments, the City’s actions are not as emphatic or supportive
as the situation demands. In the face of ongoing and increasing antisemitism,
Council should take a strong stance to combat antisemitism in our city and
provide the practical tools, such as the IHRA non-legally binding working
definition of antisemitism, to identify antisemitism when and wherever it manifests
in our community.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT the City of Vancouver adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance
Alliance (IHRA) non-legally binding working definition of antisemitism and list of
illustrative examples, as adopted by the IHRA plenary on May 26, 2016, and the
Government of Canada in June 2019, which reads:
“Antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as
hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, November 16 and 22, 2022 10
are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property,
toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities.”
B. THAT Council direct staff to share this motion and the International Holocaust
Remembrance Alliance non-legally binding working definition of antisemitism with
the Vancouver Police Board, Vancouver Public Library, Vancouver Park Board
and Vancouver School Board for their review and consideration as an additional
practical and educational tool, in addition to any existing working definitions, in
identifying antisemitism.

i Since 2005, the United Nations and its member states have held commemoration ceremonies to mark
the anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau and to honour the victims and the survivors of the
Holocaust. The purpose of this Day is to commemorate the victims of the Nazi regime, and to promote
Holocaust education throughout the world.
ii The stated purpose of an August 2022 staff memo to Mayor and Council, which followed up on a March
2021 Anti-Racism and Cultural Redress update to Mayor and Council, was to provide an update on the
development of an anti-racism action plan as directed through Council motion 13927: Standing Up to the
Rise in Anti-Asian Racism, All Racism & Hate Crimes 13927 (Nov 2020). The work to address the Council
motion 13367: Combatting Anti-Semitism in Vancouver 13367 (Jul 2019) was included as part of this
effort. https://vancouver.ca/files/cov/2022-08-05-cm-update-on-anti-racism-strategy.pdf

become one of Vancouver’s official observances.

10. Urgent Measures to Uplift Vancouver’s Chinatown (Member’s Motion B.3)
At the Council meeting on November 15, 2022, Council referred the above-noted motion to the
Standing Committee on Policy and Strategic Priorities meeting on November 16, 2022, in order
to hear from speakers, followed by debate and decision.

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, November 16 and 22, 2022 11
The Committee heard from four speakers in support of the motion, one speaker in opposition of
the motion, and two speakers speaking to other aspects of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
WHEREAS
1. Vancouver’s Chinatown is a cultural gem and holds an irreplaceable place in the
fabric of our city and in the hearts and minds of Vancouver residents;
2. Historically, Vancouver’s Chinatown community was established before the city
was even incorporated and is considered to be the largest Chinatown in Canada.
It has been a designated National Historic Site since June 2010;
3. Symbolic of the resilience and strength of Chinatown and Chinese Canadians in
the face of adversity, are the 20th century’s two world wars where Chinese
Canadians fought for a country where they could not vote, where they had been
the target of race riots spurred by anti-Asian sentiment, and been subjected to
discriminatory policies from all three levels of government including: the Chinese
head tax, a freeway plan that would have paved over Chinatown, and even a
federal order to ban the sale of delectable Chinese barbecued meats;
4. In April 2018, Vancouver City Council officially apologized to the Chinese
Canadian community, recognizing the historical discrimination against Chinese
People in Vancouver, and committed to conserving, commemorating, and
enhancing the living heritage and cultural assets of the community;
5. In recent years, Vancouver’s Chinatown has been hit by – and struggled with –
challenges ranging from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic to ongoing anti-
Asian hate in the city. Anti-Asian hate crime incidents saw a 400 percent increase
from 2018 to 2022 YTD, with violent assaults and random attacks on local
seniors, ongoing safety concerns, and increasing graffiti and vandalism impacting
small businesses, cultural organizations, and institutions;
6. According to a preliminary report to Council by City staff, vacancy rates have
increased in Chinatown by 23.7 percent compared to pre-pandemic levels, hitting
17 percent relative to the Vancouver citywide average of 10 percent. Broken
windows are common, and nuisance and damaging graffiti are now a constant
that shopkeepers and building owners cannot keep up with (yet many were
further challenged by punitive City by-laws that levy fines if graffiti is not removed
quickly enough);
7. The economic survival and vibrancy of the Chinatown community is being
hindered by these issues that are not being suitably addressed, and the impacts
are being felt by area residents, small businesses, cultural organizations, locals,
and visitors alike;
8. Without immediate action, more than 700 small businesses and arts and culture
organizations that operate in Chinatown are very much at risk. Many are
culturally relevant or legacy businesses, such as the community hub Goldstone
Bakery and Restaurant which recently closed after 30+ years of operation. The

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, November 16 and 22, 2022 12
character and the customs of these businesses that could soon be lost forever
are what make Chinatown what it is. Collectively they comprise the unique,
intangible qualities and living cultural heritage upon which the contemplated
UNESCO World Heritage Site designation hinges;
9. Recently, the Vancouver Police Foundation supported a visit of representatives
and community leaders to San Francisco’s Chinatown in order to learn firsthand
how this historic neighbourhood had overcome similar challenges to those faced
by Vancouver’s Chinatown. City of Vancouver staff were invited to be part of that
initiative. The findings the delegation identified highlighted the fact that the
success in addressing the problems of San Francisco’s Chinatown was built on
strong partnerships between local community groups, the San Francisco police
department, and the City of San Francisco Public Works department, as well as
through the establishment of clearly defined programs, communications
protocols, and resource allocation;
10. Specifically, San Francisco set about tackling issues in their Chinatown through a
multi-pronged approach including:
• Alley beautification
• Graffiti response & mural programs
• Clean-up efforts
• Volunteerism and community initiatives
11. Success in San Francisco was achieved by explicitly directing that City sanitation
and cleaning resources be stepped up and dedicated to the initiative, including
activities such as weekly power washing of sidewalks and alleys, enhanced
cleaning and needle pick-up, placemaking through beautification of alleys and art
projects with local artists, removal of punitive by-laws that fine businesses for not
removing nuisance graffiti quickly enough, shifting to a help-centered approach
with a dedicated number to call the City’s Public Works for assistance, and
volunteer groups that would do patrols and also help with cleanup and other
efforts;
12. Vancouver’s Chinatown is a cultural gem under siege. Rectifying the situation
requires immediate leadership from Vancouver City Hall in partnership with the
local community to invest in and support uplifting Chinatown to help return
vibrancy to this important neighbourhood.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to report back by the first regular Council meeting in
January 2023 with a draft action plan to support urgent measures to uplift
Chinatown, including engaging with the VPD and community leaders regarding
the San Francisco experience to inform the action plan;
FURTHER THAT the plan to uplift Chinatown shall include, but not be limited to,
recommendations for enhanced support from Streets & Engineering including
robust street, alley, and sidewalk cleaning, litter and needle pick-up, new graffiti
removal strategies, place-making, new murals or local artwork, as well as

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, November 16 and 22, 2022 13
outreach opportunities that include local community groups in graffiti clean-ups,
safe walks, and seniors support.
B. THAT the above direction to staff in A above, identify the required resources from
the 2023 Operating Budget, and that consideration be given to extending the
impact of these resources through use of the Community Stewards Program and
engagement with the Chinese Policing Centre.
C. THAT staff report back as soon as possible on potential by-law changes to
remove or waive fines to property owners and businesses that are repeat victims
of nuisance and damaging graffiti.
D. THAT Council direct staff to establish a satellite City office in Chinatown, such as
within the City-owned Chinatown Plaza, or within another City-owned property or
reasonable alternative, to provide Mayor and Council with the ability to work from
the space and meet with community members as desired.
amended
AMENDMENT MOVED by Councillor Fry,
THAT the following be added to the motion, as A:
AND FURTHER THAT the plan to uplift Chinatown shall include, but not be limited to
populations with intersecting lived experiences in the neighbourhood: seniors, new
immigrants, residents of single room occupancy hotels, Urban Indigenous people,
LGBTQIA2S+, people experiencing poverty, people experiencing homelessness, and
people who use drugs; with an explicit goal to return vibrancy and safety to the
community without exclusion or displacement of vulnerable residents.

the target of race riots spurred by anti-Asian sentiment, and been subjected to
discriminatory policies from all three levels of government including: the Chinese
head tax, a freeway plan that would have paved over Chinatown, and even a
federal order to ban the sale of delectable Chinese barbecued meats;
4. In April 2018, Vancouver City Council officially apologized to the Chinese
Canadian community, recognizing the historical discrimination against Chinese
People in Vancouver, and committed to conserving, commemorating, and
enhancing the living heritage and cultural assets of the community;
5. In recent years, Vancouver’s Chinatown has been hit by – and struggled with –
challenges ranging from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic to ongoing anti-
Asian hate in the city. Anti-Asian hate crime incidents saw a 400 percent
increase from 2018 to 2022 YTD, with violent assaults and random attacks on
local seniors, ongoing safety concerns, and increasing graffiti and vandalism
impacting small businesses, cultural organizations, and institutions;
6. According to a preliminary report to Council by City staff, vacancy rates have
increased in Chinatown by 23.7 percent compared to pre-pandemic levels, hitting
17 percent relative to the Vancouver citywide average of 10 percent. Broken
windows are common, and nuisance and damaging graffiti are now a constant
that shopkeepers and building owners cannot keep up with (yet many were
further challenged by punitive City by-laws that levy fines if graffiti is not removed
quickly enough);
7. The economic survival and vibrancy of the Chinatown community is being
hindered by these issues that are not being suitably addressed, and the impacts
are being felt by area residents, small businesses, cultural organizations, locals,
and visitors alike;
8. Without immediate action, more than 700 small businesses and arts and culture
organizations that operate in Chinatown are very much at risk. Many are
culturally relevant or legacy businesses, such as the community hub Goldstone
Bakery and Restaurant which recently closed after 30+ years of operation. The
character and the customs of these businesses that could soon be lost forever
are what make Chinatown what it is. Collectively they comprise the unique,
intangible qualities and living cultural heritage upon which the contemplated
UNESCO World Heritage Site designation hinges;

9. Recently, the Vancouver Police Foundation supported a visit of representatives
and community leaders to San Francisco’s Chinatown in order to learn firsthand
how this historic neighbourhood had overcome similar challenges to those faced
by Vancouver’s Chinatown. City of Vancouver staff were invited to be part of that
initiative. The findings the delegation identified highlighted the fact that the
success in addressing the problems of San Francisco’s Chinatown was built on
strong partnerships between local community groups, the San Francisco police
department, and the City of San Francisco Public Works department, as well as
through the establishment of clearly defined programs, communications
protocols, and resource allocation;
10. Specifically, San Francisco set about tackling issues in their Chinatown through a
multi-pronged approach including:
• Alley beautification
• Graffiti response & mural programs
• Clean-up efforts
• Volunteerism and community initiatives
11. Success in San Francisco was achieved by explicitly directing that City sanitation
and cleaning resources be stepped up and dedicated to the initiative, including
activities such as weekly power washing of sidewalks and alleys, enhanced
cleaning and needle pick-up, placemaking through beautification of alleys and art
projects with local artists, removal of punitive by-laws that fine businesses for not
removing nuisance graffiti quickly enough, shifting to a help-centered approach
with a dedicated number to call the City’s Public Works for assistance, and
volunteer groups that would do patrols and also help with cleanup and other
efforts;
12. Vancouver’s Chinatown is a cultural gem under siege. Rectifying the situation
requires immediate leadership from Vancouver City Hall in partnership with the
local community to invest in and support uplifting Chinatown to help return
vibrancy to this important neighbourhood.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to report back by the first regular Council meeting in
January 2023 with a draft action plan to support urgent measures to uplift
Chinatown, including engaging with the VPD and community leaders regarding
the San Francisco experience to inform the action plan;
FURTHER THAT the plan to uplift Chinatown shall include, but not be limited to,
recommendations for enhanced support from Streets & Engineering including
robust street, alley, and sidewalk cleaning, litter and needle pick-up, new graffiti
removal strategies, place-making, new murals or local artwork, as well as
outreach opportunities that include local community groups in graffiti clean-ups,
safe walks, and seniors support.
B. THAT the above direction to staff in “A” identify the required resources from the
2023 Operating Budget, and that consideration be given to extending the impact

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, November 16 and 22, 2022 16
of these resources through use of the Community Stewards Program and
engagement with the Chinese Policing Centre.
C. THAT staff report back as soon as possible on potential by-law changes to
remove or waive fines to property owners and businesses that are repeat victims
of nuisance and damaging graffiti.
D. THAT Council direct staff to establish a satellite City office in Chinatown, such as
within the City-owned Chinatown Plaza, or within another City-owned property or
reasonable alternative, to provide Mayor and Council with the ability to work from
the space and meet with community members as desired.
E. THAT staff report back on possible changes to neighbourhood transportation
policies and practices in terms of people and goods movement with specific
reference to pickup, delivery, and parking that is supportive of neighbourhood
retail activities.

Health Nurses (Member’s Motion B.5)

MOVED by Councillor Dominato
WHEREAS
1. Mental illness and addictions are experienced by residents from all corners of the
city;
2. The Vancouver Police Department (VPD) has a number of successful Mental
Health Initiatives to serve people living with mental illness. For more than 40
years the VPD has partnered with Vancouver Coastal Health (VCH) to help
improve the quality of life for mutual clients living with mental illness, substance
use, and addiction;
3. The VPD collaboration with VCH and other community partner aims to reduce
harm to both clients and the community, and to reduce a client’s involvement with
the criminal justice system, law enforcement, and emergency health services, by
providing a coordinated response;
4. The VPD’s mental health initiatives and partnerships include (but are not limited
to):
• Car 87/88 – Mental Health Cars – VPD officers partner with mental
health professionals to provide assessments and intervention for people
living with mental illness. Specially-trained officers in plainclothes team up
with psychiatric nurses seven days a week and respond to requests from
patrol officers and Assertive Outreach Team members for mental health
assistance. They determine the most appropriate action in each case,
which can include immediate referrals for community-based mental health
services or emergency intervention.
• Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) Teams – A small group of
clients have repeated and frequent use of the emergency medical system
and extensive contact with police. They also encounter barriers to
housing and employment. It makes living in the community challenging.
ACT teams provide full-service mental health programs and “wrap-
around” care for clients with a history of complex mental health issues.
The teams help clients transition to traditional community-based care.
Teams are 10 to 12 people, and include police officers, nurses, social
workers, psychiatrists, and vocational counsellors.
• Assertive Outreach Team (AOT) – While ACT addresses the most high-
risk, high-needs clients through long-term, wrap-around services, the
Assertive Outreach Team (AOT) provides short-term bridging services to
clients to help them transition from hospital or jail to longer-term
community-based services, such as ACT. VPD officers collaborate with

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, November 16 and 22, 2022 18
Vancouver Coastal Health psychiatrists, nurses, and clinical supervisors
to reduce incidents of violence and self-harm, prevent further
deterioration in quality of life, and reduce involvement with the criminal
justice system.
• VPD Mental Health Unit – The VPD Mental Health Unit works to reduce
the number of people cycling through the criminal justice system as a
result of untreated mental health disorders. The Unit works with
Vancouver Coastal Health Mental Health clinical staff. Together, they
ensure a coordinated response.
5. On December 8, 2020, Council approved a net VPD budget of $316,079,342 plus
$300,000 in separate funding for CPCs, resulting in a VPD budget shortfall of
$5,689,974 for 2021. The VPD quantified this funding shortfall as being
equivalent to 61 police recruits, or 4.5% of the VPD’s authorized sworn strength;
6. On March 8, 2021, the Police Board appealed to the Province’s Director of Police
Services for a review of Council’s decision under section 27(3) of the Police Act;
7. In March 2022, B.C.’s Director of Police Services, Wayne Rideout, ruled that the
Vancouver Police Department should not have been denied the additional $5.7
million it requested in December 2020 to fully fund its 2021 operating budget;
8. The nature, scope, and magnitude of the mental health and addiction crisis
facing Vancouver requires a significant and substantial increase in supports and
actions to improve the quality of life for those living with mental illness, substance
use, and addiction in our city.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council empower the Mayor to write to the Vancouver Police Board (VPB)
and the Board of Vancouver Coastal Health (VCH) on behalf of Council to
formally advise of Council’s intention to make funding available to the Vancouver
Police Board and VCH to enable the requisitioning and hiring of 100 new police
officers and 100 mental health nurses to support various mental health initiatives
and partnerships between the two agencies;
FURTHER THAT copies of the Mayor’s letters be sent to the senior management
of the Vancouver Police Department (VPD) and VCH, the Vancouver Police
Union, local Indigenous Governments, and other relevant partners and
stakeholders.
B. THAT Council direct staff to allocate an initial block of funding in the City’s 2023
operating budget in the amount of $4.5 million to enable the Vancouver Police
Department (VPD) to requisition and hire new police officers. Such funding will
be made available to the VPD on or after January 1, 2023 subject to Council’s
acceptance of plan from the VPD for hiring and deploying the additional police
officers to enhance and expand mental health initiatives and partnerships
between VPD and Vancouver Coastal Health (VCH), such as the Car 87/88
program, Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) Teams and Assertive Outreach

FINAL MOTION AS APPROVED
WHEREAS
1. In October 2012, Vancouver City Council approved the Transportation 2040 plan.
The plan serves as the City’s long-term strategic vision to help guide
transportation and land use decisions, and public investments for the years
ahead;
2. The plan sets long-term targets and includes both high-level policies and specific
actions to achieve this vision;
3. In November 2020, City council approved the Climate Emergency Action Plan,
which included actions to significantly cut carbon emissions from the biggest
local sources such as burning gas and diesel in vehicles and using natural gas in
buildings;
4. As part of the Climate Emergency Action Plan, transportation actions were
developed to create more options for transit, cycling and walking, and to create
more walkable communities. To further encourage the shift to active
transportation and transit, Council directed staff to assess the feasibility of
transport pricing, otherwise known by terms such as road pricing, congestion
pricing, and a road tax;
5. Transport pricing (i.e., a road tax) would be a fee for vehicles to drive into, and
through Vancouver’s city centre;
6. Encouraging active transportation and greater transit use, while reducing the
number of private vehicle trips in the city, are desirable objectives. However, the
public have clearly indicated that they do not support a road tax in order to
achieve the city’s transportation and climate objectives.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Vancouver City Council direct staff to ensure
that all work and processes specific to the planning and implementation of Transport
Pricing, by and exclusively within the City of Vancouver, planned or otherwise or by any
other technical definition or name, including any planning for the implementation of
Transport Pricing for Downtown Vancouver and the Central Broadway Corridor as per
the CEAP, is suspended except as is related to current and ongoing regional and
provincial work on transport pricing within Metro Vancouver;
FURTHER THAT any and all City staff who may be engaged in work related to the
implementation of Transport Pricing by and within the City of Vancouver, exclusive of
staff participation in regional transportation discussions and conversations, shall be –
and shall be confirmed to be – reassigned to work on other transportation priorities in the
city.
