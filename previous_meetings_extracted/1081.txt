A. THAT Council approve the Northeast False Creek Plan and associated Public
Benefits Strategy, as presented in Appendix A of the Policy Report dated
January 19, 2018, entitled “Northeast False Creek Plan (“NEFC Plan”) and
Viaducts Replacement Project”, as a guiding policy framework for the

waterfront district with a new destination waterfront park, with the following
amendments as set out in the Memorandum dated February 12, 2018, from the
General Manager of Planning, Urban Design and Sustainability, entitled
“Northeast False Creek Plan and Viaducts Replacement Project – Recommended
amendments to respond to speakers’ concerns”, as follows:
1. CHINATOWN
• 1a. Council commit the City Manager to convene regular meetings with the
Chinatown Working Group and Chinese Benevolent Association (CBA) of
Vancouver, and have staff work with these groups to establish guiding
principles for the Chinatown Cultural District that can help inform work on
the UNESCO application process and inform further design of the new NEFC
parks, streets, and land use planning for Sub-area 6D.
• 1b. Council direct staff to report back with a financial strategy for
delivering on the objectives of the NEFC Plan, including scenarios for
increasing the amount of rental and non-market housing that can be
achieved in Sub-area 6D, including housing for vulnerable seniors, and the
financial implications of these scenarios.
• 1c. That language within sections 4, 9 and 14 of the NEFC Plan be
strengthened to reinforce the importance of Northeast False Creek being a
‘front door’ to Chinatown, including:
• A grand promenade on the Carrall Greenway alignment through the park
that establishes a strong gateway from the False Creek waterfront,
• Improvements to Andy Livingstone Park, and the portions of Keefer
Street and Quebec Street adjacent to Andy Livingstone Park to better
integrate renewed park features into Chinatown, and

Pacific Boulevard that allows improved access into Chinatown.
• 1d. That policy within sections 4, 9 and 14 of the NEFC Plan be amended to

Chinatown Gateway on Main Street, including elements relating to the
multi-cultural heritage, adjacent land uses and built form, retail curation,

important historical sites, cultural centre, streetscape design, land trusts,
and the issue of neighbourhood boundaries.
• Replace section 4.3 of the NEFC Plan with the following:
“The city of Vancouver was not immune to the interstate freeway boom’ of
the 1950s and 60s. Three major freeways were planned to cut through the
city, two in an east-west direction and one in a north-south direction. The
Georgia and Dunsmuir Viaducts were a tiny piece of a massive interchange
planned as part of the freeway system. With the old Georgia Viaduct
propped up by timber braces and shedding lumps of concrete it needed to
be replaced and a successful plebiscite was held to approve the
construction of the new and expanded viaducts; two separate ribbons of
raised concrete, sweeping eastward from downtown, with the ultimate
goal of connecting through the eastern neighbourhoods of Grandview
Woodlands and Hastings Sunrise to the Trans-Canada highway.
This connection and the proposed connecting overpasses for the Waterfront
freeway along Carrall and Gore Avenue would significantly impact
Chinatown and the Strathcona neighbourhood. Area residents who had
already successfully fought the urban renewal proposals, now turn their
attention to the freeways and joined a city-wide coalition of residents
determined to stop it.
In 1967, the Waterfront route’s funding collapsed and soon opposition to
the rest of the network prevailed with the federal government saying that
without community support federal funding would not be forthcoming. The
defeat of both urban renewal and the freeway are considered turning
points that significantly shaped the city’s future and bolstered the idea
that neighbourhoods are at the heart of city planning.
If the traffic issues can be resolved or managed ... the removal of the
viaducts is a huge opportunity to heal some of the scars the historic
Chinatown district has had to endure from the failed urban renewal
projects of another era.
The construction of the Georgia and Dunsmuir Viaducts displaced an
eclectic mix of warehouses, junk yards, Chinese laundries, single family
homes, rooming houses and a significant apartment complex facing Main
Street.
The Chinatown Community along with the residents of Strathcona were
instrumental in the fight against the real threat of displacement and
erasure brought by the proposed urban renewal and freeway networks. The
building of two large housing projects, the clearance of the entire block
bounded by Gore, Jackson, Pender and Keefer, and the building of the
Viaducts all had a long lasting impact on the community. Chinatown’s
growth was restricted by the artificial and imposed borders of Gore Avenue
and the Viaducts. Beyond the land expropriated for the Viaducts, the
connections between Chinatown and the south of Main Street were broken,
businesses were lost and community members moved away.” - Historical
Discrimination Against Chinese People in Vancouver Advisory Group.

Special Council Meeting
Minutes, Tuesday, February 13, 2018 4
The Northeast False Creek Plan presents a real opportunity to heal the
wounds for all involved and a not to be missed chance to reconnect
communities and repair the urban fabric.
• 4.3.1 Conserve, commemorate and enhance living heritage and
cultural assets in Chinatown by securing heritage funding in the
public benefits strategy that can be used for capital and cultural
funding.
• 4.3.2 Support the Keefer Memorial Square redesign and reimagining
it as a future gateway to Chinatown and ensure the Andy
Livingstone Park redesign integrates recreation and cultural
programming for Chinese seniors and the community, and that
policies for Quebec and Keefer Street build upon and enhance the
design context.
• 4.3.3 Seek opportunities to identify appropriate and relevant names
for assets within Northeast False Creek based on the history and
contribution of the Chinese Community.
• 4.3.4 Explore opportunities to create and designate cultural space
within Northeast False Creek for story-telling and other activities
with a focus on Chinese Canadian culture.
• 4.3.5 Work with stakeholders in Chinatown to co-design an
engagement strategy that aligns the planning efforts in Chinatown
and reaches out to the Chinese speaking community, including
addressing translation and interpretation needs, and deploy staff
who demonstrate cultural competency in their work.
• 4.3.6 Invest in cultural programming with a focus on Chinese
Canadian history and culture, and partner with community
organizations in establishing and enhancing walking tours in
Chinatown.
• Add: 4.3.7 Support the process towards a UNESCO designation of World
Heritage Site for Chinatown, supported through the implementation of the
Chinatown Cultural District, and an engagement strategy that aligns
discussions about the future of this area, including:

• Maximizing positive impacts to Chinatown businesses (see Chapter 8
of the NEFC Plan for additional details), and
• Ensuring Retail Curation Strategies submitted for new retail
development in Sub-area 6D (Main Street blocks) are responsive the
cultural heritage of the area.

Special Council Meeting
Minutes, Tuesday, February 13, 2018 5
• Add the following introduction to section 9.5 of the NEFC Plan:
Vancouver’s Chinatown continues to be the vibrant centre of an
evolving and enduring culture, with a valuable living heritage, with
tangible and intangible characteristics of a unique universal value.
Chinatown constitutes a Cultural Landscape as defined by UNESCO. To
that end all initiatives must recognize the fragile balance of
community, culture and business, and the unintended consequences
brought by surrounding development.
The NEFC Plan is cognizant of the City’s developing approach to
working with community groups, businesses, and other levels of
government to apply for Chinatown’s inclusion on Canada’s Tentative
List for World Heritage Sites. The Plan recognizes and supports this
overall goal by establishing a Chinatown Cultural District that links
historic Chinatown with the adjacent lands in NEFC along Keefer and
Quebec streets and puts in place guiding policy to support and enhance
the cultural heritage of the area in and adjacent to NEFC. The work on
this application reinforces the idea that reconciliation and cultural
redress should be a guiding principal in the development of such an
important area of the city.
• Within the Places for Public Life in Northeast False Creek Graphic in
Section 9, Add a ‘#12 Reconnecting Chinatown’ symbol to Keefer Street.
• Add 9.5.1 Recognize that the Chinatown Cultural District should be a
welcoming ‘front door’ to Chinatown from the waterfront, including the
following objectives:
• Andy Livingstone Park should include opportunities to integrate and
support cultural programming in Chinatown,
• Establish strong gateways on the Carrall and Quebec connections as
‘cultural fingers’ that reconnect Chinatown with the waterfront, and
that support economic development in Chinatown by leveraging the
activity and energy of the Events and Entertainment District and
waterfront,
• Improve access for all transportation modes into Chinatown from the
new Pacific Boulevard at Abbott Street, Quebec Street, Main Street and
Gore Avenue, and
• New park and streets should include key utility supports for community
events.
• Add 9.5.8: Support opportunities to advance a Living Heritage and Cultural
Assets Management Plan process that will support the UNESCO application
process, including aspects related to:
• future developments in Chinatown,
• affordable and accessible housing for seniors,
• public space and retail curation that is responsive to the cultural
heritage of the area,
• tangible and intangible living heritage and cultural assets of
Chinatown, and

cultural assets in Chinatown by securing heritage funding in the

• Limiting land speculation on nearby sites in Chinatown,
• Maximizing positive impacts to Chinatown businesses (see Chapter 8
for additional details), and
• Ensuring Retail Curation Strategies submitted for new retail
development in Sub-area 6D (Main Street blocks) are responsive the
cultural heritage of the area.
• Add the following introduction to section 9.5 of the NEFC Plan:
Vancouver’s Chinatown continues to be the vibrant centre of an
evolving and enduring culture, with a valuable living heritage, with
tangible and intangible characteristics of a unique universal value.
Chinatown constitutes a Cultural Landscape as defined by UNESCO. To
that end all initiatives must recognize the fragile balance of
community, culture and business, and the unintended consequences
brought by surrounding development.
The NEFC Plan is cognizant of the City’s developing approach to
working with community groups, businesses, and other levels of
government to apply for Chinatown’s inclusion on Canada’s Tentative
List for World Heritage Sites. The Plan recognizes and supports this
overall goal by establishing a Chinatown Cultural District that links
historic Chinatown with the adjacent lands in NEFC along Keefer and
Quebec streets and puts in place guiding policy to support and enhance
the cultural heritage of the area in and adjacent to NEFC. The work on
this application reinforces the idea that reconciliation and cultural
redress should be a guiding principal in the development of such an
important area of the city.
• Within the Places for Public Life in Northeast False Creek Graphic in
Section 9, Add a ‘#12 Reconnecting Chinatown’ symbol to Keefer Street.
• Add 9.5.1 Recognize that the Chinatown Cultural District should be a
welcoming ‘front door’ to Chinatown from the waterfront, including the
following objectives:
• Andy Livingstone Park should include opportunities to integrate and
support cultural programming in Chinatown,
• Establish strong gateways on the Carrall and Quebec connections as
‘cultural fingers’ that reconnect Chinatown with the waterfront, and
that support economic development in Chinatown by leveraging the
activity and energy of the Events and Entertainment District and
waterfront,
• Improve access for all transportation modes into Chinatown from the
new Pacific Boulevard at Abbott Street, Quebec Street, Main Street and
Gore Avenue, and
• New park and streets should include key utility supports for community
events.
• Add 9.5.8: Support opportunities to advance a Living Heritage & Cultural
Assets Management Plan process that will support the UNESCO application
process, including aspects related to:
