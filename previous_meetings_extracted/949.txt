Public Hearing
Minutes, Thursday, April 4, 2019 2
Planning, Urban Design and Sustainability staff provided a presentation on the four applications
listed on the agenda and, along with the City Manager and staff from Engineering, responded to
questions.
Council also had before it a memorandum dated March 26, 2019, from the Assistant Director,
Rezoning Centre, Planning, Urban Design and Sustainability, noting a change to the title and
preamble of Part 1 of Appendix B of the Policy Reports dated February 26, 2019, entitled
“Rezoning: 76-96 West King Edward Avenue”, “Rezoning: 976 West 52nd Avenue and
6822-6868 Oak Street”, “Rezoning: 628-682 West 28th Avenue and 4435 Ash Street”, and
“Rezoning: 6250-6410 Oak Street”.
After referral of the above-noted policy reports to public hearing on March 12, 2019, it became
apparent that Part 1 of Appendix B of the reports incorrectly referred to Council approval of a
form of development for the rezoning sites. Since these applications entail rezoning from RS-1
to RM-8A or RM-8AN, there is no form of development for Council to approve as there would be
if the rezonings were to CD-1 (Comprehensive Development). While this procedure is explained
in the above-noted reports, Appendix B of each of the above-noted reports were inadvertently
prepared with the incorrect language. The correct title and preamble are as follows:
“PART 1: CONDITIONS OF APPROVAL OF THE DEVELOPMENT APPLICATION
THAT, in reviewing a development application for the site, the Director of Planning shall
have particular regard for the following:”
The Summary and Recommendation for each of the above-noted items included corrections to
Appendix B.
1. REZONING: 76-96 West King Edward Avenue
An application by Shape Architecture was considered as follows:
Summary: To rezone 76-96 West King Edward Avenue from RS-1 (One-Family Dwelling)
District to RM-8AN (Multiple Dwelling) District to permit a townhouse
development with a floor space ratio (FSR) up to 1.2. The form of
development will be reviewed through a subsequent development permit
process.
The General Manager of Planning, Urban Design and Sustainability recommended approval
subject to conditions set out in the Summary of Recommendation of the Public Hearing agenda.

Council received two pieces of correspondence in opposition to the application, since being
referred to public hearing and prior to the close of the speakers list and receipt of public
comments.
