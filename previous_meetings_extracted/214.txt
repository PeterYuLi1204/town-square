2. Reimagining and Replacing Kitsilano Outdoor Pool
MOVED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
SECONDED by Mayor Sim
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. The Kitsilano Outdoor Pool (Kits Pool) is one of Vancouver’s most unique pools
and has been a cherished and beloved community asset in the city for 50 years,
providing residents and visitors alike with recreational and instructional swimming
opportunities;
2. Kits Pool is Vancouver’s only saltwater swimming pool and the longest of its kind
in North America at 137 metres in length, with approximately the same capacity
as fifteen regular sized 25-metre six-lane pools;

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, June 26, 2024 14
3. Kits Pool is heated, has a water park, two slides, is wheelchair accessible, and
located in an unbeatable oceanside location;
4. At about 50 years old, and having sustained storm damage to the structure, Kits
Pool is now at the end of its service life, with many components failing,
deteriorating, and in need of significant repairs and/or complete replacement;
5. Despite investments, membrane renovation work completed in 2018 in response
to sustained damage, and further repair work over the past year during the off-
season, Kits Pool continues to leak millions of gallons of water daily, and
therefore pool chemicals cannot be kept in proper balance to meet established
public health standards. As a result, a disappointing decision was made to close
the pool entirely for the Summer of 2024;
It is expected that the extended closure of Kits Pool in 2024 will allow staff to fully
investigate the ongoing water loss and make the needed repairs to the
underground piping and basin to extend the facility’s useful life on an interim
basis through measures such as by installing a cost-effective custom liner, while
planning for next steps;
6. An opportunity exists to reimagine and replace Kits Pool to better serve the
needs of Vancouverites and the City’s growing population, while enhancing
accessibility and incorporating sustainable, climate resilient design principles;
7. The Vancouver Board of Parks and Recreation approved the Vancouver
Aquatics Strategy (VanSplash) on October 28, 2019, laying out a 25-year vision
for the future of aquatics in the City, and made the case for significant capital
investment to deliver new pools for residents.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council affirm the value of the iconic Kitsilano Outdoor Pool by committing
to an urgent process to reimagine and replace the pool as a priority action for this
Council;
FURTHER THAT staff be directed to work in partnership with the Vancouver
Park Board to provide a report on an urgent basis regarding all measures that
can be taken to sustain the ongoing use of the existing Kits Pool in the interim
short-term horizon before a new, reimagined Kits Pool can be constructed and
operational, including identifying various costing and funding options.
B. THAT Council direct staff to expedite the Kits Pool replacement feasibility study
work recommended in the mid-term Capital Plan update, in partnership with the
Vancouver Park Board, in order to plan for and fund the replacement of Kits Pool
with a new, modernized outdoor aquatics facility that is more resilient to climate
change, storm, and storm impacts, and report back to Council with
recommendations and options to prioritize the pool replacement project in the

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, June 26, 2024 15
upcoming 2026-2030 capital plan;
FURTHER THAT this direction to staff include exploration of additional aquatics
amenities in association with a replacement Kitsilano Outdoor Pool to provide for
the health and wellness needs of residents and pool users, such as whirlpools,

3. Enabling Outdoor Cold Plunges and Saunas
MOVED by Councillor Dominato
SECONDED by Councillor Klassen
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. Outdoor cold plunging and saunas are common in Nordic cultures. The practice
typically involves alternating between the intense heat of a sauna and the
invigorating chill of a cold plunge. Cold plunging is believed to offer a wide range
of health and wellness benefits such as increased circulation and blood flow,
faster muscle recovery, and general mental and physical refreshment;
2. Spirit baths and sweat lodges, which hold profound significance in Coast
Salish culture for physical purification, spiritual renewal, and community
bonding, share similarities with the growing cold plunge and sauna culture in
Vancouver, which offer an approachable way to promote physical wellness
and communal experiences while ensuring that more citizens of Vancouver

Minutes, Wednesday, June 26, 2024 16
have access in their communities to these important health and spiritual
modalities;
3. There is a growing interest and demand for outdoor cold plunges and saunas
among the residents of Vancouver, and a number of small businesses in the city
focused on holistic wellness, self-improvement, and personal growth have either
expressed an interest in the growing trend and/or have added cold plunging to
their health and wellness services;
4. At present, the City’s land use policies and zoning and licensing by-laws do not
allow for the operation of outdoor cold plunging and saunas. Under the City’s
policies and by-laws, cold plunges – where they may exist in the city – must be
located within a completely enclosed building;
5. In addition to the City’s licensing and zoning policies and by-laws, cold plunging
has various public health implications that are of interest to and under the
jurisdiction of Vancouver Coastal Health;
6. The City of Vancouver is committed to supporting small businesses, including
those that contribute to the health and well-being of the city’s residents; and
7. Council has devoted considerable time and energy seeking to modernize and
streamline zoning and licensing policies and objectives, such as allowing pop up
retail and other services in underutilized public spaces.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to review, develop, and propose for consideration by
Council amendments to the Zoning and Development By-law and Licence By-
law, and other by-laws if necessary, to allow for the operation of outdoor cold
plunges and saunas in appropriate locations within the city, including, for
example, underutilized commercial and industrial spaces, while ensuring they
meet all necessary health, safety, and environmental standards, and report back
by Q1 of 2025;
FURTHER THAT Council direct staff to explore and report back on options for
interim measures to enable existing cold plunge and sauna businesses to
operate while staff update the city’s zoning and licensing by-laws.
B. THAT Council direct staff to engage with Vancouver Coastal Health to request
the health authority develop an appropriate regulatory framework for enabling
outdoor cold plunges and saunas to protect the health and safety of users.
