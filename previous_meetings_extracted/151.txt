* * * * *

Standing Committee on City Finance and Services
Minutes, December 11 and 12, 2024 6
MOVED by Councillor Fry
SECONDED by Councillor Carr
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. From the late 1800s Japanese “Issei” immigrants to British Columbia found
employment in fishing, lumber, and farming contributing to the growth of the
province’s nascent resource industries. These Issei settled and established
themselves in historic communities throughout BC’s coast and in Vancouver
notably around the False Creek and Hastings Mills at Fairview and Powell Street
respectively;
2. By the late 1930’s, Japanese Canadians had well established themselves in
British Columbia, with local-born “Nisei” finding success and assimilation in
business and education, even enlisting to fight for the Canadian Forces in World
War I. With 90% of Japanese Canadians living in British Columbia and 32% of
the total population living in Vancouver, the cultural heart was centered in the
area of Powell Street, known as Paueru-gai or formerly referred to Japantown,
which nurtured community and commerce, education, spirituality, and the
legendary champion Asahi baseball team;
3. Following Canada's declaration of war with Japan on February 16, 1942,
Vancouver City Council unanimously resolved that “Vancouver City Council
representing the citizens of Canada’s largest Pacific Coast City implores the
Federal Government to remove all residents of Japanese racial origin and enemy
aliens to areas of Canada well-removed from the Pacific Coast.” 1 Subsequently,
the Canadian government decreed all persons of Japanese racial origin living
within 100 miles of the Pacific Coast be forcibly removed, detained and
incarcerated without evidence, charge or trial, and dispossessed of their property
and assets, in the name of national security;
4. From 1942 to 1943, prior to their incarceration away from the coast, over 8,000
Japanese Canadians including many Vancouverites were confined in livestock
barns and exhibition halls at the Pacific National Exhibition at Hastings Park.
Hospital patients with tuberculosis were transferred into a ward next to healthy
women and children and some patients died there. These residents of Japanese
descent were unable to return to the City of Vancouver until 1949, four years
after the end of World War II, and after most of their assets had been liquidated
(up to 1952) and reimbursed pennies on the dollar;

Standing Committee on City Finance and Services
Minutes, December 11 and 12, 2024 7
5. In 1988, the Government of Canada formally apologized to Japanese Canadians
for wartime atrocities. In 2013, the City of Vancouver apologized “for its
complicity, its inaction, and for failing to protect her residents of Japanese
descent,” pledging to “do all it can to ensure such injustices will not happen again
to any of its residents, thereby upholding the principles of human rights, justice
and equality now and in the future;” 2
6. The historic Livestock Barns at Hastings Park still stand today and remain a
powerful and painful testament to past injustices:
For many Japanese Canadians, this was a terrible, fearful experience.
They were forcibly removed from their homes, lost all of their belongings
and many families were separated. The conditions at Hastings Park were
extremely primitive and unsanitary. The primary memory for many people
was the horrible smell, followed by the noise, the boredom and the terrible
food. 3
7. Despite some formal acknowledgements and plaques, the experience of
Japanese Canadians in Hastings Park continues to be largely unknown to the
general public. Civil society groups including National Association of Japanese
Canadians, Nikkei National Museum & Cultural Centre, Tonari Gumi, Powell
Street Festival Society and others have advocated and fundraised for a
permanent and comprehensive commemorative project at Hastings Park
acknowledging the 1942-1949 incarceration;
8. In an agreement dated July, 2024 the Pacific National Exhibition (the PNE) have
acknowledged the significance of their location in the context of the 1942-1949
internment, and wish to license the construction of an interpretative monument,
ramp and display booth (collectively, the “Interpretive Centre”) within Hastings
Park in a portion of the Livestock Barns for a nominal license fee and in
perpetuity to the Japanese Canadian Hastings Park Interpretive Centre Society
(the licensee); and
9. The Japanese Canadian Hastings Park Interpretive Centre Society (JCHPICS)
have developed an architectural plan and cost schedule for renovating an
Interpretive Centre in the Livestock Barn ($2.7m - $3.3m) with partial funding
from the Japanese Canadian Legacy Society (JCLS). They are currently and
actively seeking an additional $1m grant from the JCLS by year end 2024, and
moving forward will require supplemental fundraising within the Japanese
Canadian community and financial sponsorship from the City of Vancouver and
senior governments.

direct staff to work with the Japanese Canadian Hastings Park Interpretive Centre
Society and PNE and report back with further considerations for decision in Q1 2025;
AND FURTHER THAT Council empowers the Mayor to write to the appropriate
Provincial and Federal government Minister(s) and Ministries, the Japanese Canadian
Legacy Society and any other identified funding partners to advise them of Council's
support for a Japanese Canadian Hastings Park Interpretive Centre.

2. The East Van Cross: Making Vancouver’s Iconic Landmark More Vibrant and
Accessible
* * * * *
On December 11, 2024, following the introduction of Members’ Motion 2, “The East Van Cross:
Making Vancouver’s Iconic Landmark More Vibrant and Accessible,” the Committee recessed at
11:59 am and reconvened at 1:06 pm.
* * * * *
The Committee heard from three speakers who spoke in support of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Klassen
SECONDED by Councillor Meiszner
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. The Monument to East Vancouver (also known as the East Van Cross) by artist
Ken Lum was installed in January 2010 and has become Vancouver’s most
iconic public artwork, symbolizing the city’s pride, resilience, and the rich cultural
history of East Vancouver;
2. The East Van cross symbol dates back to the 1940s and is rooted in graffiti
culture. The symbol reflects themes of marginality, defiance, and hope for East
Vancouver, representing the diverse immigrant and working-class communities
that have defined the area;
3. The East Van Cross is currently situated at the intersection of Clark Drive and
East 6th Avenue, a location with a view now partly obscured by nearby

Standing Committee on City Finance and Services
Minutes, December 11 and 12, 2024 9
development and limited by private property constraints, which reduce public
visibility and accessibility;
4. Relocating the monument to a more accessible and visible location would
enhance its symbolic significance and provide residents and visitors with a
dedicated space to experience, photograph, and engage with the artwork;
5. Relocating the East Van Cross would tangibly reaffirm the City’s commitment to
public art and the legacy of East Vancouver’s cultural history;
6. The relocation project could be financed through a combination of developer-
funded public art programs and philanthropic contributions, avoiding reliance on
general City of Vancouver revenues;
7. A new site for the East Van Cross could potentially incorporate opportunities for
commercial revenue through merchandise sales and food/beverage services,
further supporting the monument’s upkeep and community engagement; and
8. Relocating the East Van Cross to a more accessible and visible location
represents an opportunity to celebrate the cultural identity of East Vancouver
while also addressing current challenges of visibility and accessibility. By
engaging with the artist and Vancouver’s arts community, as well as potential
sponsors, the City can ensure that Ken Lum’s Monument to East Vancouver
(East Van Cross) public artwork will continue to inspire and connect with
Vancouverites and visitors for generations to come.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to explore options for relocating the Monument to East
Vancouver (East Van Cross) to a prominent, highly visible and accessible
location on the city’s east side, so that the monument continues to serve as a
cultural and geographical landmark for East Vancouver for generations to come;
FURTHER THAT the relocation plan should include, but not be limited to:
i. Public access and amenities to allow visitors to experience the monument
and take photographs safely and conveniently;
ii. A design that respects the monument’s original intent and artistic vision
while integrating it with the chosen site; and
iii. Opportunities for revenue generation, such as branded merchandise or
on-site food and beverage offerings that support the monument’s upkeep
and enhance community engagement;
AND FURTHER THAT staff be directed to report back by Q3 2025 with a
proposed relocation plan, timeline, and funding strategy, developed in
consultation with artist Ken Lum and relevant stakeholders including local First
Nations, with a plan for the relocation project that prioritizes private revenue

Standing Committee on City Finance and Services
Minutes, December 11 and 12, 2024 10
sources, including developer contributions through the Public Art Program and
other philanthropic partnerships.
B. THAT Council direct the Monument to East Vancouver relocation project be
included in the City’s sponsorship and naming rights efforts to help attract
potential sponsors and donors to the initiative, while preserving the monument’s
artistic integrity and established public significance.
Following discussion, the Committee agreed to separate the vote on the components of the
motion.
The motion was put with A having CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY (Vote No. 10416) with Councillor
Kirby-Yung absent for the vote; and with B having CARRIED (Vote No. 10417) with Councillors
Carr and Fry opposed, and Councillor Kirby-Yung absent for the vote.
3. Preserving of the City’s Purchasing Power Through Diversification of Financial
Reserves – Becoming A Bitcoin Friendly City
The Committee heard from 26 speakers who spoke in support of the motion and three speakers
who spoke in opposition of the motion.
Following discussion, it was,
MOVED by Mayor Sim
SECONDED by Councillor Montague
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. The City of Vancouver holds financial reserves intended to serve as a safeguard
for the city’s fiscal health;
2. The City of Vancouver has a fiduciary responsibility to manage its financial
reserves prudently and to safeguard the purchasing power of its funds;
3. The purchasing power of traditional fiat currencies through centralized monetary
systems has faced increasing challenges in recent years due to inflationary
pressures, expansive monetary policy (i.e., excessive money printing), and
economic instability, leading to significant currency debasement;

Standing Committee on City Finance and Services
Minutes, December 11 and 12, 2024 11
4. In 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) published the famous Bitcoin
whitepaper titled Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System which laid out
the foundational principles of Bitcoin as a decentralized, digital currency
impervious to the ups and downs of centralized monetary systems; 4
5. As an open, decentralized, and secure digital asset, Bitcoin has been recognized
by many financial experts and analysts as a potential hedge against inflation and
currency debasement and represents a viable store of value due its capped
supply and growing adoption in the global economy;
6. As regulatory frameworks have evolved over the course of Bitcoin’s 16-year
existence, and the use of Bitcoin has diversified, Bitcoin has earned a solid
reputation and gained broad acceptance and garnered institutional interest.
Bitcoin has been the number one best performing financial asset over the past 16
years, and major institutions and investors are increasingly coming to see Bitcoin
as a legitimate, long-term store of value. Examples include Fidelity, BlackRock,
Charles Schwab, Deutsche Bank, Agricole, and Banco Santander, all of which
have become Bitcoin investors / supporters, as well as various exchange-traded
funds (ETF);
7. A growing number of cities globally have begun to explore the integration of
Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies into their financial strategies, demonstrating
proactive measures to preserve capital in a changing economic
landscape, enhance the stability and growth of their financial reserves, and even
by integrating Bitcoin into everyday transactions within their local economies
such as accepting Bitcoin as a method of payment. This including payment for
municipal services and fees;
8. A review of cities and other jurisdictions that have explored and/or adopted
Bitcoin highlights the diverse ways it is being embraced globally, whether it be
tourism initiatives or addressing local economic challenges, including making it a
key component in day-to-day and long-term financial activities. Examples
include:
• Zug, Switzerland – dubbed "Crypto Valley" – was one of the first
municipalities to accept Bitcoin for public services and taxes. This small
city with a population of fewer than 30,000 people has since become a
global center for blockchain and crypto startups due to Switzerland's
supportive regulatory environment. It is now considered to be one of the
most technologically advanced cities in the world.
• Seoul, South Korea has embraced digital currencies, with local
government initiatives exploring blockchain integration in municipal
operations. Residents can use Bitcoin for various payments and services,
supported by local exchanges and innovative fintech companies.
4 On January 3, 2009, Nakamoto mined the first block, known as the genesis block or Block 0, marking the start of
the Bitcoin blockchain and the creation of the first bitcoins. Bitcoin has gone from being a niche experiment to a
significant global asset and the foundation of a multi-billion-dollar cryptocurrency industry.

Standing Committee on City Finance and Services
Minutes, December 11 and 12, 2024 12
• El Salvador became the first country to make Bitcoin legal tender in 2021,
primarily in the coastal town of El Zonte, also known as "Bitcoin Beach."
This initiative has encouraged widespread Bitcoin use, supported by
government wallets and tax incentives for crypto-based businesses.
These innovative financial strategies have helped El Salvador earn two
bond upgrades since adopting Bitcoin as legal tender and committing to
buying 1 Bitcoin per day since 2021. El Salvador’s Bitcoin strategy has
contributed significantly to the country’s economic growth, with
projections suggesting El Salvador may achieve debt freedom by 2028. In
contrast, the U.S. has faced two bond downgrades during this same
period.
• Lugano’s Plan ₿ is a joint initiative between the City of Lugano and Tether
to accelerate the use of and leverage bitcoin technology as the foundation
to transform the city’s financial infrastructure. The plan will scale
blockchain and Bitcoin throughout the city to positively impact all facets of
daily life for the residents of Lugano. From small transactions with local
merchants to larger efforts – such as paying annual taxes – blockchain
will serve as the foundation for the city’s financial exchanges. 5
https://planb.lugano.ch/
• The Pennsylvania House of Representatives recently passed a bitcoin
legislation bill to position the state at the forefront of digital asset
regulation and to foster innovation in the sector in recognition of
blockchain technology’s transformative potential. Bill 2481 enshrines the
rights of individuals and businesses to self-custody digital assets, operate
blockchain nodes, and conduct transactions without interference from
restrictive municipal ordinances. Additional legislation under consideration
(i.e., the Pennsylvania Bitcoin Strategic Reserve Act), would enable the
state treasurer to allocate up to 10% of Pennsylvania’s General Fund,
Rainy Day Fund, and State Investment Fund into bitcoin and crypto-
based exchange-traded products (ETPs) – up to $970 million – to
leverage Bitcoin’s potential as both a hedge against inflation and a long-
term growth asset. Ten other states are reportedly exploring similar
legislation to enable adding Bitcoin to their strategic reserves as is the
incoming federal administration in Washington, DC on the national level.
9. For people living in underdeveloped countries in Africa, where over 600 million
people live without electricity, Bitcoin mining provides a significant social impact
pathway. A prime example is the village of Bondo in Malawi where Gridless – a
Kenyan company that designs, builds, and operates Bitcoin mining sites –
installed a micro-hydro mini-grid in the village. The micro-hydro mini-grid
harnesses renewable, clean power of the plentiful water resources in the
mountainous region to generate electricity and mine Bitcoins. Gridless not only
earns income to sustain the mini-grid, the organization also provides affordable
electricity now to over 1,800 homes in Bondo. Villagers have access to electricity

now to power light bulbs, fridges, TVs, and phones and are also starting new
businesses, and preserving food, storing medicine, and being able to study at
night;
10. Bitcoin mining has shown environmental benefits by consuming low-cost, excess
energy from stranded renewable sources and waste methane, thus reducing
emissions and supporting grid stability. Research indicates that Bitcoin miners
seek the cheapest power available, frequently opting for intermittent renewable
energy that would otherwise go unused thanks to the "interruptible" nature of
Bitcoin mining. The energy use profile of Bitcoin mining not only helps to balance
electricity demand and avoid peak strains on infrastructure, Bitcoin also makes
renewable energy projects financially viable (and in fact helps renewable energy
projects get built that would not otherwise be built) while also stabilizing energy
prices and advancing global decarbonization efforts;
11. Vancouver is recognized as an important hub for blockchain and cryptocurrency
innovation in Canada, with a vibrant blockchain ecosystem that gained
international recognition when the world's first Bitcoin ATM was installed in a
Vancouver coffee shop in 2013. Vancouver is also home to a number of
prominent blockchain companies, such as Dapper Labs (creator of CryptoKitties),
HIVE Blockchain, and Victory Square Technologies, which have contributed to
advancing blockchain-based applications across sectors like digital collectibles,
cryptocurrency mining, and AI-driven solutions. By becoming a Bitcoin friendly
city, it ensures that Vancouver plays a leadership role in fostering new jobs and
creating economic value similar to Silicon Valley’s role in the development of the
internet and signals Vancouver’s willingness to embrace innovation;
12. Diversifying the City of Vancouver's financial reserves and payment options to
include Bitcoin would not only enhance the resilience of our City’s financial
portfolio it would ultimately benefit the city’s taxpayers by preserving the value
and purchasing power of precious tax dollars and other financial resources
against the volatility of traditional currencies while also aligning the City with the
innovative financial strategies and approaches needed to combat economic
challenges in the digital age, including currency debasement and inflation, and
13. It would be irresponsible for the City of Vancouver to not look at the merits of
adding Bitcoin to the City’s strategic assets to preserve the City’s financial
stability.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
THAT Council direct staff to explore options to make Vancouver a “Bitcoin Friendly City”
by undertaking a comprehensive analysis of the potential to integrate Bitcoin into the
City of Vancouver's financial strategies, such as (but not limited to) accepting taxes and
fees in Bitcoin as well as the potential conversion of a portion of the City’s financial
reserves into Bitcoin to preserve purchasing power and guard against the volatility,
debasement, and inflationary pressures of traditional currencies, and

Standing Committee on City Finance and Services
Minutes, December 11 and 12, 2024 14
FURTHER THAT staff be directed to report back to Council on the feasibility, risks, and
potential benefits of such a “Bitcoin Friendly City” strategy by the end of Q1 2025, with
specific direction to, but not be limited to:
i. consulting with financial advisors, cryptocurrency experts, and relevant
stakeholders to:
a. ensure a thorough understanding of the implications of asset conversion and
establishing a safe and secure method for managing the assets acquired
through Bitcoin, including any legislative changes that may be required;
b. develop a comprehensive framework for the management, storage, and
potential liquidation of Bitcoin assets to ensure full transparency and
accountability to the citizens of Vancouver by implementing appropriate
policies and guidelines to govern the procurement and holding of Bitcoin
reserves;
c. engage with the wider community, including local stakeholders, residents,
and experts in the cryptocurrency space, to gather feedback and foster an
informed dialogue regarding this strategic proposal; and
d. promote transparency in this initiative by keeping the public informed about
developments and engaging citizens in discussions about the potential
impact of this strategic shift.

THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. During the 2021 “heat dome” 619 people died in BC; more than 100 in
Vancouver. Most of the deaths occurred amongst older residents in older
buildings without cooling;
2. The City of Vancouver has developed a Climate Emergency Action Plan and
associated policy that has been widely praised for its focus on reducing
Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. The largest source (about 57 percent) of
Vancouver’s GHG emissions is buildings – specifically the heating of space and
hot water. Policy to date has largely focused on regulating new building

Standing Committee on City Finance and Services
Minutes, December 11 and 12, 2024 15
construction—the easiest, least costly and most effective strategy. More
challenging is the energy retrofit of existing buildings. A Council decision on
November 26, 2024, maintained policy that restricts the use of fossil fuels in new
housing which will mean fewer buildings in the future will need to be retrofitted,
leaving the focus on older buildings, which largely contain the most affordable
housing, constructed prior to the policy’s implementation;
3. Vancouver City Council has allocated $5M in capital budgets that helped to
retrofit civic buildings which resulted in almost all of the city’s Branch libraries
getting air cooling equipment (HVAC or heat pumps), enabling them to serve as
“safe places of retreat” for vulnerable residents during extreme heat events;
4. Amongst the most challenging, and most impactful, of existing buildings to retrofit
include affordable, non-profit housing, where it’s important to ensure that the cost
of retrofits doesn’t fall on residents or affect the affordability of the housing;
5. A working group, established by Councillor Carr in 2023 and originally comprised
of representatives from Vancouver City (Council and Mayor’s office), Metro
Vancouver, the Zero Emissions Innovation Centre (ZEIC) and Vancouver Airport
Authority (YVR), began exploring strategies to establish a voluntary carbon offset
program to offer YVR air travellers. That work has continued through 2024 and
expanded to include the BC Non-Profit Housing Association (BCNPHA);
6. BCNPHA is an independent society that receives no government funding for its
own operation. It supports non-profit housing providers that own and/or operate
affordable housing in Vancouver and other BC municipalities, including
affordable, transitional, supportive and subsidized housing. The society is
engaged in assisting in the retrofits of buildings, including in measuring GHG
reductions to enable reporting on outcomes;
7. YVR, as part of the working group in developing this project, has indicated its
interest in pursuing a trial “carbon offset” program that could include offering
travellers to and from Vancouver an opportunity to voluntarily purchase carbon
offsets to support energy retrofits in local non-profit housing that achieve
measurable carbon reductions, possibly in the time period around FIFA 2026;
and
8. To date the project has been facilitated off the side of a Councillor’s desk. There
is a need for a lead coordinating body to facilitate the communications between
project partners, coordinated implementation and follow-up.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
THAT Council directs staff to:
i. Engage partners, including Vancouver Airport Authority (YVR), BC Non-
Profit Housing Association and others if appropriate, in developing a trial
voluntary carbon offset project that would offer YVR air travellers,
possibly in the period of time around the FIFA 2026 games the
opportunity to offset the carbon emissions associated with their air travel,

the completion of the trial project, with an analysis of outcomes and set of
recommendations regarding potential follow-up.

CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY (Vote No. 10421)
FINAL MOTION AS APPROVED
WHEREAS
1. During the 2021 “heat dome” 619 people died in BC; more than 100 in
Vancouver. Most of the deaths occurred amongst older residents in older
buildings without cooling;
2. The City of Vancouver has developed a Climate Emergency Action Plan and
associated policy that has been widely praised for its focus on reducing
Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. The largest source (about 57 percent) of
Vancouver’s GHG emissions is buildings – specifically the heating of space and
hot water. Policy to date has largely focused on regulating new building
construction—the easiest, least costly and most effective strategy. More
challenging is the energy retrofit of existing buildings. A Council decision on
November 26, 2024, maintained policy that restricts the use of fossil fuels in new
housing which will mean fewer buildings in the future will need to be retrofitted,
leaving the focus on older buildings, which largely contain the most affordable
housing, constructed prior to the policy’s implementation;
3. Vancouver City Council has allocated $5M in capital budgets that helped to
retrofit civic buildings which resulted in almost all of the city’s Branch libraries
getting air cooling equipment (HVAC or heat pumps), enabling them to serve as
“safe places of retreat” for vulnerable residents during extreme heat events;
4. Amongst the most challenging, and most impactful, of existing buildings to retrofit
include affordable, non-profit housing, where it’s important to ensure that the cost
of retrofits doesn’t fall on residents or affect the affordability of the housing;
5. A working group, established by Councillor Carr in 2023 and originally comprised
of representatives from Vancouver City (Council and Mayor’s office), Metro
Vancouver, the Zero Emissions Innovation Centre (ZEIC) and Vancouver Airport
Authority (YVR), began exploring strategies to establish a voluntary carbon offset
program to offer YVR air travellers. That work has continued through 2024 and
expanded to include the BC Non-Profit Housing Association (BCNPHA);

reductions to enable reporting on outcomes that would engender trust in the air
travellers who want evidence that their offset purchase would actually reduce
carbon emissions;
7. YVR is exploring ways to enable airport users to join collaborative efforts to
reduce travel-related carbon footprints during the FIFA gams. Currently in the
exploratory phase, YVR will continue to work with the City of Vancouver on
sustainability initiatives related to FIFA and beyond;
8. To date the project has been facilitated off the side of a Councillor’s desk. There
