2. Creating a Regulatory Framework for Retail Sales of Psilocybin and Entheogens in
Vancouver
The Committee heard from 11 speakers who spoke in support of the motion, and two speakers
who spoke to other matters of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Fry
SECONDED by Councillor Carr
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. Vancouver has seen the number of unlicensed and unregulated retail shops
selling “magic” mushrooms (psylocibin) and other entheogens rapidly increase in
recent years. Although most mushrooms and entheogens are classified as
controlled substances, there has been no prosecution or conviction of their
retailers, and to date no business license regulations specific to their sale or
display;
2. Entheogens are psychoactive substances that alter perception, mood, or
behaviour, for spiritual, therapeutic, and/or inspirational purposes. First termed by
ethnobotanists and anthropologists in the late 20th century, entheogens have
been used by indigenous peoples around the world for millennia and may be
variously referred to as hallucinogens and psychedelics in scientific literature and
popular vernacular respectively. Examples of naturally occurring (plant/fungi)
entheogens include Cannabis, Psilocybin (aka magic mushrooms), Peyote,
Mescaline, Auyahuasca, and Kratom;
3. Entheogenic substances are generally considered safer than opioids since
psychedelics are not known to cause physical dependencies or risk of overdose.
There is much scientific and medical research on this topic - see John Hopkins
Medicine Center for Psychedelic and Consciousness Research1. The National
Library of Medicine, an official website of the United States Government notes:
“They (psychedelics) are generally considered physiologically safe and do not
lead to dependence or addiction”;2

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, April 10, 2024 8
4. Therapeutic use of psychedelics has been applied for depression, anxiety,
smoking cessation, PTSD, Alzheimer’s, ADHD, anorexia, and to treat substance
use disorders including alcohol and opioid addiction. A National Library of
Medicine article concludes: “The possibility exists that drugs like psilocybin can
meet a major unmet need in the treatment of psychiatric disorders”; 3
5. Vancouverites are consuming entheogens. Recreational use of natural
psychedelics in North America has doubled in the last three years, in particular
among adults aged 19-30.4 Awakened interest in natural psychedelics promoted
on social media, lifestyle blogs, film, literature, and popular science as well as a
documented trend away from alcohol consumption in younger demographics
have all contributed to increased popularity and consumption. Anecdotally, in
Vancouver in particular, fear of toxic contaminated supply of other illicit “party
drugs” has prompted a shift towards entheogens and natural psychedelics,
generally seen as niche, natural, and safer. Other users, eschewing prescription
pharmaceuticals, are “micro-dosing” 5 regular, small amounts of psychedelics as
a therapeutic natural health supplement;
6. Legally, many (but not all) entheogens are designated under Schedule 3 of
Canada’s Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA), which prohibits
possession except as authorized through exemptions, including to individuals for
their own therapeutic use. Schedule 3 drugs are described as drugs with low to
moderate potential for abuse and/or addiction. However, some scheduled
substances –Psilocybin in particular– are being studied, considered for
therapeutic use, and are made available with permission of Health Canada
through Section 56 Exemptions or Special Access Programs;
7. Despite the CDSA, mushroom dispensaries have popped up across Canada and
online, selling psilocybin and entheogenic products, powders, tinctures, capsules,
growing kits, and raw materials for recreational and therapeutic use. In
Vancouver, close to two dozen mushroom dispensaries sell recreational and
therapeutic psychedelics. To date and over the span of several years, no
mushroom dispensary in Vancouver has been charged or convicted of any
criminal activity: possession, trafficking or otherwise, under provincial or federal
law;
8. In 2016, responding to a significant increase in drug-related overdoses and
deaths, attributable to an unregulated and unsafe supply of drugs by organized
crime, BC declared a public health emergency, which remains in effect. Despite
the emergency, the November 1, 2023, BC Coroners Service Death Review

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, April 10, 2024 9
Panel report notes that the number of deaths due to toxic drugs, primarily
fentanyl, continues to rise. In a news article on mushroom dispensaries in the
City of Toronto, a spokesperson for Toronto police noted that rather than focus
on mushroom dispensaries, the service’s drug enforcement is “largely focused on
the trafficking of illegal drugs that are resulting in overdose deaths”; 6
9. In Vancouver, policing and public safety priorities do not target drug possession
for personal therapeutic or recreational use, except in cases of street disorder or
another substantive criminal offence:
“Historically, the VPD adopted a very low level of enforcement directed at
‘narcotic in possession’ (NIP) offences, as well as liquor offences... In response
to community complaints, as well as a strategic commitment to reduce street
disorder… enforcement strategy is based primarily on the behaviour and location
of a person in possession of or using a psychoactive substance.”; 7
10. In 2015, faced with a similar proliferation of unregulated, yet well used retail
shops selling CDSA-prohibited products, the City of Vancouver introduced the
Medical Marijuana Related Uses (MMRU) framework. The unique license starting
cost was $33,000/ year (2015) to operate a retail cannabis store and included
provisions and conditions for public safety including prohibiting sales to minors,
and distancing from youth and vulnerable population-serving facilities.
The framework leveraged the City’s powers of licensing, zoning, and land use to
ensure availability of MMRU services sufficient to meet local needs and that
business was conducted appropriately in the context of health, safety, and the
public interest. The comprehensive City of Vancouver MMRU framework 8 was
rendered redundant and discontinued when cannabis was legalized in 2018, but
the authority and ability to license and regulate dispensaries was described thus:
"The Vancouver Charter accords Council the authority to regulate land use and
businesses such as retail shops (S. 272). The City has no authority to regulate
the sale of controlled substances such as marijuana; accordingly, this report
recommends land use and business regulations, and does not seek to regulate
the product itself.”;
11. A subsequent BC Supreme Court decision (Hinkson, 2018) on MMRU reaffirmed
the City’s authority over land use and ability to regulate street front cannabis

sales, even as they were federally illegal; 9
12. Other recent and relevant Council authority and previous decisions germane to
the sale of psylocibin and entheogens, and in response to the toxic drug crisis,
include:
a) In 2003, late Vancouver Mayor, Phillip Owen, challenged the prevailing
view of drug addiction as a criminal activity and championed a health
informed harm reduction approach through supervised injection services;
b) In December 2018, Council approved the Mayor’s Overdose Emergency
Task Force recommendations 10 which recognized the City has a limited
but essential role to play in responding to the overdose crisis related to
creating supportive built environments, including safe places and spaces,
and partnering with all levels of government on drug policy reform;
c) In June 2019, Council approved the motion Cannabis as an Alternative to
Opiates and More Dangerous Drugs on the Downtown Eastside; 11
d) In September 2019, Vancouver City Council rejected a motion to
proactively prohibit the sale of psilocybin in Vancouver,12 and in part
informed by an interest in protecting the therapeutic use of psilocybin for
opioid use disorder treatment;
e) In November 2020, Vancouver City Council unanimously resolved to ask
the federal government to decriminalize simple possession of illicit drugs
in Vancouver with an exemption from the CDSA under the provision of

13. The Vancouver License By-law 4450 Section 4(12) states that “the issuance by
the City of a licence is not a representation of any kind that a business is
compliant with any federal, provincial or other laws, including bylaws.”; 14
14. Since the City has no authority to regulate the legal sale of entheogens, but has
clear jurisdiction in the area of running a business and appropriate land use
decisions, the City could consider:
a) Creating conditions and a framework to manage and promote public
safety, best practices, appropriate operations and land use;
b) Ignoring the issue of unlicensed and unregulated entheogen retailers
altogether; or
c) Enforcing via by-law authority against unlicensed and unregulated
retailers, driving the trade and consumption of entheogens to a less safe,
less visible underground market;
15. When Vancouver became the first Canadian city to regulate marijuana
dispensaries in 2015, there was significant pushback from Health Canada and
the federal government.15 Nevertheless, experts like chief medical health officer
for Vancouver Coastal Health, Dr. Patricia Daly defended the move as reducing
potential harms and VPD Chief Constable clarifying that shutting down
dispensaries was a low priority; 16 and
16. There were 138 overdose deaths in Vancouver in 2015, when Vancouver
pioneered the MMRU Framework. In 2023, there were 644 deaths in Vancouver
and as of 2024, over nine per week.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council is committed to public safety, including harm reduction for people
who use drugs, and recognizes that a regulated market of safe supply
mushrooms and entheogens can be considered a form of harm reduction:
a. as a substitute for more harmful drugs (e.g. alcohol, tobacco, prescription
opiates and some illegal drugs such as heroin or cocaine); and

b. as a means to reduce the rates of opioid overdose deaths and opioid-
related morbidity.
B. THAT Council direct staff to examine and report back with jurisprudence and the
legal context necessary, including relevant local by-laws, licensing, zoning, and
development policies to apply a retail framework to regulate business licenses for
retailers of entheogens like psilocybin, peyote, mescaline, auyahuasca, and
kratom.
C. THAT Council direct staff to examine the Medical Marijuana Related Uses
(MMRU) framework of 2015-2018 and report back with a framework and cost-
recovery model for licensing that could be applied to entheogens, to achieve a
careful balance between ensuring adequate availability for those in need and
ensuring community health, safety, security, aesthetics, equity, and enjoyment of
property, with considerations to include:
a. education and advocacy with a focus on harm reduction, safe, and
responsible consumption;
b. best practices for retail operations, security, and public safety;
c. distancing from youth and youth-serving facilities; and
d. attention to the store location, exterior and premise including signage,
displays, and public visibility;
FURTHER THAT Council direct staff to present alternate considerations for
entheogen dispensaries including ignoring the issue altogether, and the pros and
cons of actively prohibiting entheogenic retailers in the City of Vancouver.
D. THAT the Mayor on behalf of Council write the Federal and Provincial Ministers
of Health and Public Safety respectively, advising the proliferation of, and public
desire for access to entheogens; and the necessity of an evidence-based harm
reduction approach that considers expanding safe, accessible, and appropriately
regulated supply for people who use them.

Minutes, Wednesday, April 10, 2024 13
WHEREAS
1. Vancouver has a relatively small footprint, gentle topography, low pollution rates,
a mild climate, and an extensive network (close to 80%) of local roads without a
centre line. Vancouver also has a high cost of living that is further compounded
by transportation expenses. These factors, combined with a healthy outdoor-
loving population, a cultural imperative to embrace sustainability, and bolstered
by government investments in supportive infrastructure and transportation
demand management position Vancouver to be a global leader in intra-city active
transportation;
2. Active transportation is human-powered mobility like walking, biking, or rolling. In
recent years active transportation has been significantly enhanced by low-power
personal (micro)mobility devices such as electric-assist e-bikes, e-scooters, and
e-skateboards, share platforms, and multi-modal opportunities for first-and-last
kilometre active transportation with transit;
3. Active transportation allows mobility choice and equity for youth, tourists, people
with limited mobility, low income, or without a driver's licence. Active
transportation can support lower absenteeism and decrease lost productivity due
to traffic congestion;
4. Transportation 204017 (approved 2012) set strategies and targets to ensure that
by 2040 at least two-thirds of all trips are by active transportation and transit, and
there are zero traffic-related fatalities. To reach these goals, the City must:
a. Invest in constructing and maintaining public infrastructure like streets,
sidewalks, bikeways and public spaces;
b. Encourage supportive infrastructure in private development through
policies and guidelines;
c. Manage street use through rules and regulations; and
d. Empower residents to make sustainable transportation choices;
5. Evidence suggests that safety and perceptions of safety are determinants of
increasing active transportation mode share. To meet that objective and
Transportation 2040, in 2016 Vancouver developed a Vision Zero Transportation
Safety Action Plan with a goal to have zero traffic related fatalities and serious
injuries;18
6. Vision Zero highlights the probability of pedestrian survival is about 90% if struck
by a motor vehicle travelling at 30 km/h, but survival is reduced to 20% if struck

by a motor vehicle travelling at 50 km/h. Accordingly, lower speed limits are more
compatible with active transportation, and healthier, equitable communities;
7. Unanimously approved by Vancouver City Council in 2019, the resolution Safer
Slower Streets: 30 km/h Residential Street Pilot 19 recognized the BC-based
Road Safety Law Reform Group recommendation that, “A default provincial
speed limit of 30 km/h for Local Streets (no centre line, less than 1,000
vehicles/day) should be included in the Motor Vehicle Act, with municipalities
enabled to increase speed limits on local streets in a case by-case basis by by-
law and posted signage.”; and the conventional understanding at the time that a
blanket speed limit reduction for local streets would require significant signage
costs for the City (notably, a sign on every block of every street). The motion
resolved to:
a. Direct staff to identify a local street, area, or areas within the city to pilot a
30 kilometre per hour speed limit demonstration project; and
b. Submit a resolution, subsequently passed, at UBCM that called on the
Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure (MoTI) to consider an
amendment to the Motor Vehicle Act (MVA) that would allow incorporated
municipalities to institute blanket speed zones in residential areas;
8. Following the City of Vancouver-led UBCM Resolution20 requesting blanket
speed reductions, the MVA was amended in 2019 to allow speed reduction Pilot
Projects. Notably, Part 13 (304-305)21 of the MVA prescribes a “Three-year time
limit for regulations for pilot projects under this Part.” Additionally, the MoTI
replied in the following Response Package 306334 - Municipal Speed Limits22:
“The MVA does not specify the frequency or placement of speed limit signage–it
is not necessarily the case that a municipality establishing either a 30 or 40 km/h
speed limit on roads within specific geographic areas in the community will need
to post speed signs on every block.” (p16. #306334);

policy changes allow micromobility devices to travel on major roadways (instead
of adjacent sidewalks) at posted speeds of 50 km/h it should be noted that the
International Transport Forum (ITF) defines micromobility as speeds less than 45
km/h. In reality most e-scooter drivers travel at speeds typically between 20-30
km/h.
The International Transport Forum further notes that “motor vehicles are involved
in about 80% of crashes that result in the death of bicycle or e-scooter riders”
suggesting cities “Reallocate road and parking space to micromobility users,
cyclists and pedestrians” and advocating “Speed limits for all motor vehicles
should be no higher than 30 km/h where motorised vehicles and vulnerable road
users share the same space.”
“30 km/h is the maximum limit recommended for cars in city streets to reduce the
risk of death or serious injury from a collision of cars with pedestrians and other
vulnerable road users. Limiting cars, motorised two-wheelers and micromobility
to the same low speeds on streets with mixed motorised and non-motorised
traffic is a logical approach.”;30 and
14. Vancouver is faced with projected and actual growth in active mobility, driven by
a desire for less expensive and more sustainable transportation, reduced parking
requirements in new construction, planning for complete communities, pandemic
recovery, generational changes in attitudes around driving and automobile
ownership, and the rapid growth in inexpensive micromobility devices and
regulations to support their safe and accessible use. The imperative to support
safe, sustainable, resilient and inclusive active transportation through reduced
speed limits on the vast network of local streets is crucial to meeting the City’s
climate, sustainable development, and transportation goals.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to report back with analysis of benefits to slower, safer
streets –specifically, 30 km/h maximum speed limits in residential areas on local
streets without a centre line—as a means to enhance safety, support mixed
mode use, including micromobility and active transportation, in order to foster
healthier, equitable communities.
B. THAT Council direct staff to provide clarity on interpretation of the Motor Vehicle
Act speed limit reduction sign-frequency requirements versus previous
assumptions of a per block necessity, considering the recent Ministry of
Transportation and Infrastructure response package, and analysis of Victoria’s 30
km/h local street speed limit initiative and roll out, and as potentially pertains to
local implementation;

(Councillor Bligh absent for the vote)
In order to participate in debate on the amendment on Motion 3 - Revisiting and Refreshing
Vancouver’s Commitment to Safer Slower Streets, Chair Klassen relinquished the Chair to

The amendment having carried, the motion as amended was put and CARRIED
UNANIMOUSLY (Vote No. 09906) with Councillor Bligh absent for the vote.
FINAL MOTION AS APPROVED
WHEREAS
1. Vancouver has a relatively small footprint, gentle topography, low pollution rates,
a mild climate, and an extensive network (close to 80%) of local roads without a
centre line. Vancouver also has a high cost of living that is further compounded
by transportation expenses. These factors, combined with a healthy outdoor-
loving population, a cultural imperative to embrace sustainability, and bolstered
by government investments in supportive infrastructure and transportation
demand management position Vancouver to be a global leader in intra-city active
transportation;
2. Active transportation is human-powered mobility like walking, biking, or rolling. In
recent years active transportation has been significantly enhanced by low-power
personal (micro)mobility devices such as electric-assist e-bikes, e-scooters, and

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, April 10, 2024 19
e-skateboards, share platforms, and multi-modal opportunities for first-and-last
kilometre active transportation with transit;
3. Active transportation allows mobility choice and equity for youth, tourists, people
with limited mobility, low income, or without a driver's licence. Active
transportation can support lower absenteeism and decrease lost productivity due
to traffic congestion;
4. Transportation 204031 (approved 2012) set strategies and targets to ensure that
by 2040 at least two-thirds of all trips are by active transportation and transit, and
there are zero traffic-related fatalities. To reach these goals, the City must:
a. Invest in constructing and maintaining public infrastructure like streets,
sidewalks, bikeways and public spaces;
b. Encourage supportive infrastructure in private development through
policies and guidelines;
c. Manage street use through rules and regulations; and
d. Empower residents to make sustainable transportation choices;
5. Evidence suggests that safety and perceptions of safety are determinants of
increasing active transportation mode share. To meet that objective and
Transportation 2040, in 2016 Vancouver developed a Vision Zero Transportation
Safety Action Plan with a goal to have zero traffic related fatalities and serious
injuries;32
6. Vision Zero highlights the probability of pedestrian survival is about 90% if struck
by a motor vehicle travelling at 30 km/h, but survival is reduced to 20% if struck
by a motor vehicle travelling at 50 km/h. Accordingly, lower speed limits are more
compatible with active transportation, and healthier, equitable communities;
7. Unanimously approved by Vancouver City Council in 2019, the resolution Safer
Slower Streets: 30 km/h Residential Street Pilot 33 recognized the BC-based
Road Safety Law Reform Group recommendation that, “A default provincial
speed limit of 30 km/h for Local Streets (no centre line, less than 1,000
vehicles/day) should be included in the Motor Vehicle Act, with municipalities
enabled to increase speed limits on local streets in a case by-case basis by by-
law and posted signage.”; and the conventional understanding at the time that a
blanket speed limit reduction for local streets would require significant signage
costs for the City (notably, a sign on every block of every street). The motion

a. Direct staff to identify a local street, area, or areas within the city to pilot a
30 kilometre per hour speed limit demonstration project; and
b. Submit a resolution, subsequently passed, at UBCM that called on the
Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure (MoTI) to consider an
amendment to the Motor Vehicle Act (MVA) that would allow incorporated
municipalities to institute blanket speed zones in residential areas;
8. Following the City of Vancouver-led UBCM Resolution34 requesting blanket
speed reductions, the MVA was amended in 2019 to allow speed reduction Pilot
Projects. Notably, Part 13 (304-305)35 of the MVA prescribes a “Three-year time
limit for regulations for pilot projects under this Part.” Additionally, the MoTI
replied in the following Response Package 306334 - Municipal Speed Limits36:
“The MVA does not specify the frequency or placement of speed limit signage–it
is not necessarily the case that a municipality establishing either a 30 or 40 km/h
speed limit on roads within specific geographic areas in the community will need
to post speed signs on every block.” (p16. #306334);
9. To facilitate the Pilot Projects under Part 13 and in response to changing
transportation mode share and patterns resulting from COVID-19 the City
introduced the Slow Streets Program37 to help reshape how we view and use
local streets using barriers, signage, and placemaking, and the Neighbourhood
Traffic Management Program38 to improve the comfort and safety of people
walking, biking, or rolling on local streets, with neighbourhood pilots throughout
the city;
10. Polling by Research Co. (June 2022)39 asked what Vancouverites thought of a
speed reduction to 30 km/h on select residential streets in the City. 72% thought
it was a “good” or “very good” idea (9% were “not sure”);
