CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY
B. Motions on Notice
1. Call for a Public Inquiry into Money Laundering in B.C. and Impacts on Vancouver
Real Estate and the Overdose Crisis
MOVED by Councillor Boyle
SECONDED by Councillor Fry
WHEREAS
1. Peter German’s ‘Dirty Money’ report commissioned by B.C.’s Attorney General,
revealed significant money laundering taking place in Lower Mainland casinos,
estimating over $1 million has been laundered in B.C.;
2. The work of local investigative journalists, including findings from an RCMP
study, has revealed links between money laundering, fentanyl distribution, and
Vancouver real estate. These reports estimate that over $1 billion could have
been laundered through Vancouver homes;
3. The Provincial Government continues to investigate these links, through an
Expert Panel on Money Laundering, an anonymous tip portal, and a second
study by Peter German to be completed in March 2019;
4. Vancouver City Council passed a motion on January 29, 2019, submitted by
Councillor De Genova, on Deterring and Preventing Money Laundering and the
Business of Organized Crime in the City of Vancouver. That motion included that:
a. Page 16 of the Dirty Money Report, recommendation “R45” suggests
“That the Province undertake research into allegations of organized crime
penetration of the real estate industry”;
b. In “Dirty Money” Mr. German states “79. Part 2 overviews the
phenomenon of transnational organized crime and the unique position in
which Vancouver finds itself. It describes the ‘Vancouver Model’, which
provides a very practical framework for what has occurred in recent
years. A primer is included on money laundering”;
c. Mr. German also states in his report the most lucrative crimes in
Vancouver are related to illegal drug sales. The drugs of choice cover the
spectrum, from natural products such as cannabis, cocaine and heroin, to
chemical creations such as opioids and hallucinogens;

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, February 12, 2019 13
5. As of December 16, 2018, an estimated 353 overdose deaths have occurred in
Vancouver in 2018, which is almost on par with the 369 overdose deaths that
occurred in 2017, despite the extensive harm reduction investments in
Vancouver. Vancouver continues to have the highest rates of death per capita in
BC, with 58 deaths per 100,000 people this year, and Vancouver continues to be
the most impacted city of the overdose crisis in Canada;
6. Vancouver’s housing affordability crisis has skyrocketed over recent years. Data
from the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver shows that the average price
of a single-family detached home in Greater Vancouver increased as much in
2016 as it did from 1981 to 2005. Local housing costs far exceed local incomes,
and the gap between housing costs and local incomes increased sharply
between 2011 and 2016.
7. Charbonneau Commission deputy chief prosecutor Simon Tremblay has stated
that an inquiry could exist side-by-side with any other investigation in B.C., as
happened in Quebec. Meaning that existing investigations needn't be a barrier to
beginning a larger Public Inquiry.
8. British Columbians are in favour of a public inquiry into money laundering. A
Research Co poll last August showed that three-in-four residents (76%) believe
the provincial government should “definitely” or “probably” call a public inquiry.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council endorse a call for the Provincial Government to launch a Public
Inquiry into money laundering in B.C., similar to the Charbonneau Inquiry in
Quebec, to begin after Peter German’s review of money-laundering in B.C. real
estate, due in March.
B. THAT the Mayor write a letter to the Premier, the Minister of Finance, and the
Attorney General, communicating Vancouver’s support for a Public Inquiry.
C. THAT Council request the terms of reference for this Public Inquiry include:
i. Investigation into money laundering in Vancouver real estate that may
have deepened the city’s housing affordability crisis;
ii. Investigation into links between organized crime, money laundering, and
the overdose crisis, which resulted in the deaths of nearly 1500 people
across BC in 2018, including an estimated 353 people in Vancouver.

2. Interim Funding for School Meal Program
MOVED by Councillor Fry
SECONDED by Councillor Bligh
WHEREAS
1. Vancouver’s Healthy City Strategy is comprised of thirteen long-term goals and
an integrated plan for healthier people, healthier places, and a healthier planet;
2. The Healthy City Strategy includes goals both that Vancouver's children have the
best chance of enjoying a healthy childhood, and a healthy, just, and sustainable
food system;
3. Nutritionally-balanced school meal programs are widely considered to have a
positive effect on school performance, as well as cognitive and social-emotional
skill development;
4. Since 2014, the City of Vancouver though Arts Culture and Community Services
has been providing $320,000 per year to the Vancouver School Board and
$80,000 per year to the Strathcona Community Centre Association for school
food programs;
5. Over the past three years, costs of the Vancouver School Board meal provision
supported by the City of Vancouver have increased which has led to a reduction
in students served from 258 per day to 200 per day;
6. Other nutritious meal programs are delivered more cost-effectively
(e.g. Strathcona Community Centre $3.54, Carnegie Community Centre $4.36 to
$6.20);
7. City staff have encouraged the Vancouver School Board to deliver nutritious
meals at a lower cost per meal, enabling more students to be fed;
8. In 2017, the Vancouver School Board commissioned a food services review to
inform a three-year Food Services Plan which is expected to be shared with the
City in April 2019;
9. As part of the 2019 budget process, staff put forward a reduction of $160,000 to
the grant to balance the operating budget and because of the increasing costs of

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, February 12, 2019 15
the Vancouver School Board meal program where increasing cost per meal was
impacting the reach of the program. Staff also identified that while City resources
make a contribution, school meal provision is a Provincial mandate;
10. The City maintained $80,000 in the 2019 Operating Budget for the Strathcona
Community Centre Association meal program because nutritious meals are
delivered at a reasonable cost, enabling the City to support more children with its
grant;
11. That Vancouver School Board (VSB) staff are intending to review the imminent
VSB 3-year Food Services Plan and advise City staff as to whether concerns
about cost per meal can be addressed to ensure maximum reach for the City’s
investment;
12. Without immediate alternate funding, efficiencies in food services provision, or
internal reprioritization of Vancouver School Board (VSB) resources by the VSB,
there are concerns that the currently served vulnerable children may experience
school-day hunger that reinforces stigma and impacts children’s ability to learn,
and general health outcomes;
13. That under the existing operating model, the funding gap to maintain the existing
meal program until the end of the 2018/2019 school year is $32,000 should the
Vancouver School Board choose to apply the current $160,000 grant to the
remainder of the 2018/2019 school year.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council approve a one-time $32,000 grant to the Vancouver School Board
Meal Program to enable them to complete the 2018/2019 school year with the
current model, source of funds to be reprioritization within the 2019 Operating
Budget.
B. THAT City staff be directed to report back no later than mid-July 2019 with
recommendation for City support of the Vancouver School Board (VSB) meal
program for the 2019/2020 school year, provided the VSB presents a meal
program with a cost per meal that is in-line with the range of costs of other
nutritious meal programs.
C. THAT if the Vancouver School Board is unable to present a meal program with a
cost per meal that is more in-line with other nutritious meal programs, City staff
be directed to engage in discussions with other community partners to explore
other models for more affordable delivery of nutritious meals to students.
D. THAT Council direct the Mayor to liaise with the Vancouver School Board (VSB)
Chair, encouraging them to consider internal reprioritization within the VSB
budget to increase support this program.
E. THAT Council direct the Mayor to write a letter to the Province requesting
increased Provincial investment in school meal programs in BC, working toward
a universal meal program in all schools, in alignment with their commitment to
health promotion and poverty reduction.

4. Changing Vancouver’s Housing By-laws, Policies and Budgets to Achieve Real
Housing Affordability
The motion below contains changes from the original motion on the agenda. Changes are noted
in bold italics.
MOVED by Councillor Carr
SECONDED by Councillor Wiebe
WHEREAS
1. The lack of rental housing available at rents affordable for low to average income
earners in Vancouver is a primary cause of Vancouver’s housing affordability and
homelessness crisis;
2. Over 50 percent of Vancouver residents are renters, with 44 percent (more than
50,000 renter households) paying more than 30 percent of their income on rent
and utilities and 25 percent paying more than 50 percent of their income on rent
and utilities (source: Vancouver Courier May 8, 2018);
3. The standard definition of affordable housing used by the Canada Mortgage and
Housing Corporation (CMHC) and BC Housing states that a household should
pay no more than 30 percent of their gross income on rent;
4. The City of Vancouver offers incentives to build rental housing including the
waiving of Development Cost Levies if proposed rents are at or below rents
specified in the city’s Rental Incentive Guidelines, currently ranging from
$1,496 for a studio to $3,365 for a 3-bedroom unit on the East side and $1,646
for a studio to $3,702 for a 3-bedroom unit on the West side, the lowest of which
would require a household income of $59,840 to be affordable;

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, February 12, 2019 17
5. Vancouver’s 2018 Housing Data Book reveals that 12 percent of Vancouver
renter households earn less than $15,000 per year; 18 percent earn between
$15,000 and $30,000 per year, and 20 percent earn between $30,000 and
$50,000 per year. Given that 50 percent of Vancouver renter households earn
less than $50,000 per year, affordable rents for half of Vancouver’s renter
households should be, at the most, $1,250 per month or less;
6. Vancouver has been primarily incentivizing and subsidizing rental housing only
affordable for households at higher incomes. From 2006 to 2016, as a portion of
all renter households, households earning below $25,000 per year have dropped
from 38 to 27 percent and renter households earning over $100,000 per year
rose from 7 to 19 percent (City of Vancouver 2018 Housing Data Book);
7. The Vancouver Housing and Homelessness Strategy Reset passed by Council
on March 29, 2017 states that the City will change business practices and
connect new and existing housing supply to local residents’ incomes, family size
and location, and the Housing Vancouver Strategy of November 28, 2017
focuses city efforts on the “right supply” of housing, but only states that new
housing must be in line with the broad range of local incomes in Vancouver.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to:
i. Review all existing Vancouver housing programs to identify ways to meet
Vancouver residents’ needs for affordable housing at rates in line with the
Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) and BC Housing
definitions of housing affordability (a household paying no more than
30 percent of gross household income on rent);
ii. Report back in 2019, through the upcoming review of rental
incentive programs (e.g. Rental 100), the development of a new
incentive program for Community-based Housing, and the
development of the governance model and implementation strategy
for the Vancouver Affordable Housing Endowment Fund on, specific
changes to our housing program goals and targets as well as changes to
by-laws, policies and incentive programs that will incentivize and enable
delivering the ‘right’ supply of housing to truly match residents’ needs for
affordable housing based on CMHC’s definition of housing affordability;
iii. Propose for Council’s consideration and incorporation into Vancouver’s
2020 capital and operating budgets the funds needed to move forward on
the housing program changes needed to achieve the delivery of the ‘right’
supply of housing to truly match residents’ needs for affordable housing
based on CMHC’s definition of housing affordability.

5. Canadian Pride in Vancouver’s Chinatown Memorial Square
MOVED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
SECONDED by Councillor Hardwick
WHEREAS
1. At the November 1, 2017, Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic
Priorities, City Council unanimously approved the Administrative Report dated
October 20, 2017, entitled: “Historical Discrimination Against Chinese People in
Vancouver” including the following key actions:
i. Adoption of the “Preliminary Research on Historical Discrimination
Against Chinese People in Vancouver” report that provides context and
background for the initiative;
ii. A request for a public acknowledgement and a formal apology for past
legislation, regulations and policies of previous Vancouver City Councils
that discriminated against residents of Chinese descent;
2. Recommendation #2 in the Historical Discrimination Report aims to Strengthen
Relations with the Chinese Canadian Community through Legacy Actions that
can confirm the values of a just and inclusive community;
3. The City of Vancouver values opportunities to celebrate our rich multiculturalism
through public arts, installations and events that instill civic pride. There is no
greater symbol of unity than the Canadian flag;
4. Council has previously provided support for a redesign of the Keefer Memorial
Square and reimagined it as a future gateway to Chinatown as part of a
UNESCO Heritage site application. Such a redesign is a number of years away
from completion;
5. An engaged community group wishes to create a legacy action through the
funding and installation of a flagpole at Chinatown Memorial Square that can
proudly fly the Canadian flag. The Vancouver Chinatown Lions Club is prepared
to underwrite the purchase and installation of a 30-foot flagpole, believing that
the display of this symbol of Canadian pride would complement the resident
statue that is dedicated to Chinese Canadian pioneers and veterans;
6. Installation of a flagpole would contribute to the continued work of building
connected communities that celebrate Vancouver’s cultural diversity, and

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, February 12, 2019 19
positively recognize the contributions of Chinese people to the history, fabric, and
success of our city and country;
7. The Vancouver Chinatown Lions Club will be celebrating its 65th anniversary in
2019 and sees an opportunity to bring the community together for a public
flag-raising event on May 5, 2019;
8. The initiative is supported by Pacific Unit 280 of the Army, Navy and Air Force
Veterans in Canada as well as the Chinese Canadian Military Museum Society;
9. Acceptance of funding to support the installation of a flagpole in partnership with
Vancouver’s Chinese community is a timely and significant gift opportunity.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council endorse the installation of a flagpole at or in proximity to
Chinatown Memorial Square through the acceptance of a flagpole and support
base gift from the Vancouver Chinatown Lions Club as a symbol of unity and
cross-cultural pride.
FURTHER THAT such acceptance be subject to review by Planning, Urban
Design and Sustainability, and Engineering staff.
B. THAT Council direct staff to discuss the potential for installation of a flagpole now
with a moveable base vs. the consideration of waiting for the installation as part
of the Memorial Square redesign.
C. THAT ongoing maintenance and any nighttime lighting costs would be the
responsibility of the City of Vancouver.
D. THAT staff work with the donor and Chinatown community organizations on
flagpole siting options.
E. THAT Council acknowledge that this initiative supports work underway in
reconciliation of the “Historical Discrimination Against Chinese People in
Vancouver”.

Earlier in the meeting, Council agreed to withdraw this item from the agenda.
7. Collecting Fines and Exploring Ways to Recover Costs Related to Public Safety in
the City of Vancouver's Entertainment District
MOVED by Councillor De Genova
SECONDED by Councillor Dominato
WHEREAS:
1. i) The City of Vancouver website, lists "Fighting" as a City of Vancouver
by-law fine;
ii) The City of Vancouver Street and Traffic By-Law No. 2849 section 69.A
states under the section titled "Fighting" that "A person must not fight or
engage in any other similar physical confrontation with one or more other
persons in, on, or near a street or other public place";
2. An overwhelming majority of fighting fines are issued in Vancouver's
Entertainment District and specifically, in the Granville Entertainment District
(GED). Issuing, enforcing and collecting unpaid fines under bylaw No. 2849
Section 69.A requires the Vancouver Police Department (VPD) and City of
Vancouver resources; and the cost is funded by taxpayers, residents and
businesses in the City of Vancouver;
3. Persons who are street homeless, individuals with no fixed address and
individuals challenged with debilitating mental illness are not among the
demographics typically issued fines for fighting under By-Law 2849 section 69.A
in Vancouver's Entertainment District;
4. Marginalized individuals are less likely to possess British Columbia Identification
(BCID), British Columbia Driver's Licenses (BCDL), and or motor vehicle
insurance. For this reason, they are less likely to be impacted by any fines or
penalties require payment, in advance of renewing identification or insurance;
5. The City of Vancouver and the VPD have no certainty that fines will be collected
for tickets issued for fighting under By-Law 2849 section 69.A;
6. There is general knowledge among people who receive fines for "fighting" under
By-Law 2849 section 69.A, that ramifications are minimal, and are not on the
same scale as tickets or fines issued under the Motor Vehicle Act (e.g. requiring
payment of outstanding fines as a condition of a renewing BCDL, BCID or car
insurance in British Columbia.);
7. Vancouver Police Department data shows that in 2015 (66%) and 2016 (64%)
of individuals who are the subject of police calls in Granville Entertainment
District, and were booked in the Vancouver Jail between Friday-Saturday
nights between 10pm-4am and the early hours of Sunday morning reside
outside of the City of Vancouver.

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, February 12, 2019 21
8. Pursuing the payment of a fine issued for "fighting" in the Street and Traffic
By-Law No. 2849 Section 69.A may result in a greater cost to the City of
Vancouver if sent to collections, than revenue the fine would generate, if
collected;
9. The British Columbia Ministry of Public Safety and Solicitor General require
penalties and fines for an Immediate Roadside Prohibition (IRP) including
prohibition from driving for 3, 7 or 30 days in the case of a warn IRP, or for 90
days in the case of a fail or a refusal IRP, as outlined on a served IRP Notice of
Prohibition. Total costs also include driver license reinstatement fees and all
costs associated with a vehicle impoundment. Fees for review are $200 for an
oral review and $100 for a written review;
10. The British Columbia Ministry of Public Safety and Solicitor General require
penalties and fines for the use of an electronic device for communicating with
another person or another device by email or other text-based message, e.g.,
texting, emailing, talking or dialing. Fines are $368 and 4 penalty points. As of
March 1, 2018, drivers who have two or more distracted driving tickets in a
three-year period will pay a Driver Risk Premium (DRP) and could see their total
financial penalties rise to as much as $2,000 – an increase of $740 over the
existing penalties. This is in addition to their regular insurance premium, and all
fines must be paid before a driver's license and or car insurance will be renewed;
11. The City of Vancouver faces issues of affordability, homelessness and the City of
Vancouver operating budget annually faces increased costs for public safety, by
Vancouver residents, business and property owners;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to consult with the
Vancouver Police Department and the Province of British Columbia, in the interest of
public safety to:
i. Consider policies or enact by-laws to help the City of Vancouver achieve
greater success collecting fines issued and/ or recovering costs
associated with offences under By-Law 2849 section 69.A and other
related offences in the City of Vancouver Entertainment District.
ii. Consider the benefit of requesting amendments to provincial legislation,
that may require fines issued for fighting or similar offences to be paid
before the individual can:
• renew or purchase motor vehicle insurance in British Columbia
• renew British Columbia Driver's License (BCDL)
• renew British Columbia Identification (BCID)
iii. Explore the authority of the City of Vancouver to associate outstanding
fines for By-Law 2849 section 69.A and an individual’s credit rating.
FURTHER THAT staff report back to Council and present their findings and any
recommendations before the end of Q4 2019.

NOTICE OF MOTION
1. Review of SNC-Lavalin relationship with the City of Vancouver
Submitted by: Councillor Hardwick
WHEREAS
1. On January 30, 2019, Vancouver City Council endorsed a Skytrain extension
from Arbutus Street to UBC;
2. SNC-Lavalin built the existing Skytrain system in Vancouver in 2005,
SNC-Lavalin was awarded a contract for the total engineering, procurement,
construction, partial financing, and operations and maintenance of the project
until 2040;
3. On February 11, 2019, it was announced that Federal Ethics Commissioner
Mario Dion will investigate allegations that the Prime Minister's Office pressured
former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to help Quebec engineering firm
SNC-Lavalin avoid criminal prosecution;
4. Recent media reports since February 6, 2019, have exposed current status of
corruption charges of SkyTrain technology supplier SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. for
bribery and fraud. The criminal prosecution through Public Prosecution Service of
Canada is requiring a trial rather than a negotiated settlement agreement;
5. SNC-Lavalin and Bombardier partner for SkyTrain projects in Metro Vancouver;
6. Bombardier is also reported as being investigated for allegations of corruption
through a World Bank audit and has been struggling to produce trains for existing
orders for rail equipment or to fix equipment problems. New York City Transit
Authority announced as reported on January 24, 2019, that they are halting
delivery of any new train cars from Bombardier until more of the existing ones are
fixed;
7. Tying Broadway rapid transit solely to SkyTrain technology could delay transit
delivery with additional costs;
8. City of Vancouver statements of financial information show a total of $2,916,452
in payments to SNC-Lavalin between 2010 and 2017; and
