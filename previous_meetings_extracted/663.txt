Minutes, April 13, 2021 17
B. Council Members’ Motions
1. Preserving Bus Ridership During COVID and Beyond
MOVED by Councillor Swanson
SECONDED by Councillor Hardwick
WHEREAS
1. COVID has drastically reduced transit ridership and rebuilding rider confidence
will be challenging;
2. Members of the City’s Seniors Advisory Committee do not approve of Translink’s
proposal to reduce the number of bus stops from various bus routes because it
forces seniors and persons with disabilities to travel farther on foot or on mobility
devices to reach their buses, causing hardship to a considerable number of
people;
3. The West End Seniors Network and Riley Park South Cambie Community
Visions Steering Committee among other organizations are opposed to removing
bus stops;
4. While Translink is consulting with some people on what they call bus line
“balancing”, many riders who would normally participate in such consultations
were following the Provincial Health Officer’s instruction to stay home and
therefore are not aware of the consultation or the changes;
5. The City of Vancouver should be applying the same equity lens to transit
decisions as to all other governmental decisions;
6. The proposals to reduce the number of bus stops fails to recognize that large
percentage of the people who use transit have lower incomes with fewer other
transportation options; are women and racialized; and
7. The planned fare increase of 2.3% to take effect on July 1 will undermine the
goal of increasing ridership and improving equity on transit.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct the Mayor to inform Translink that Vancouver
Council recommends that they consult with seniors and disability groups,
neighbourhood houses, community centres, and the unions of workers who
depend on buses before cutting the number of bus stops.
B. THAT Council direct the Mayor to ask Translink to seek other ways of speeding
up buses such as bus-only lanes and barring right hand turns by non-bus traffic.
C. THAT Council direct the Mayor to inform Translink that Vancouver Council does
not support bus fare increases.

2. Joint Vancouver City Council-Vancouver School Board Committee to
Collaborate on Capital Projects
MOVED by Councillor Carr
SECONDED by Councillor Boyle
WHEREAS
1. Wherever relevant, planning in Vancouver should be collaborative between
different levels of government;
2. Vancouver School Board (VSB) schools are integral to the city as the means to
deliver public education and as neighbourhood hubs for the broader community.
The VSB Long-Range Facilities Plan [vsb.bc.ca] (LRFP) outlines facilities
management strategies in support of long-term accommodation of projected
students in support of educational programs. The educational vision [vsb.bc.ca]
of the LRFP is to support student learning and well-being through neighbourhood
schools, safe schools, vibrant learning spaces and community partnerships;
3. The recently approved VSB LRFP included this action:
The Vancouver Board of Education would like to foster a closer collaborative
relationship with the City of Vancouver Council. As such, the Board will request
to the COV the establishment of a joint VSB/COV committee to collaborate on
advancing VBE (Vancouver Board of Education) capital projects (including
LRFP). The committee will consist of 3 Trustees and 3 councillors. The
Committee would meet bi-annually with a termination date at the end of
November 2022.
A letter with this request was sent by VSB Chair Cho to the City of Vancouver
Mayor and Council on March 1, 2021;
4. A collaborative relationship between the VSB and COV could enhance:
a. Planning for new schools/expansions in areas with increasing student
populations and community partnerships in undersubscribed schools;
b. Locating before-and-after-school and 0-4 childcare at school sites;

Council Meeting
Minutes, April 13, 2021 19
c. Community partnerships for out-of-school-hours use of school facilities
such as gyms, multi-purpose rooms, auditoriums, and grounds, including
school fields;
d. City-wide consideration for provision of, and equitable access to, public
open spaces;
e. Affordable housing projects for education sector workers;
f. Meeting climate emergency objectives;
5. In a number of cases, such as at Britannia and Coal Harbour school sites, the
VBE capital projects include collaboration not only with the City of Vancouver but
also with the Vancouver Parks Board.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT City Council direct staff to:
i. Consult with the Vancouver Board of Education and report back for Council’s
consideration:
a. Draft terms of reference for a joint Vancouver City Council-Vancouver
School Board committee to collaborate on capital projects; and
b. An implementation plan including a budget and expedited timeline to both
meet the VSB’s timeline and enable incorporation into the City’s 2022
Operating Budget;
ii. Report back to Council with a final report on the outcomes, pros and cons and
overall utility of this pilot joint committee, with recommendations regarding follow-
up, and forward this report to the Vancouver School Board; and
iii. Consider the utility of including representatives from the Vancouver Parks Board
in this joint committee either during the term of this committee (to the end of
November, 2022) and/or in a possible future iteration of this committee.

3. Enhancing Organizational Governance and Development
MOVED by Councillor Dominato
SECONDED by Councillor Wiebe
WHEREAS
1. The Community Charter states municipalities serve to:
(a) provide for good government of its community;
(b) provide for services, laws and other matters for community benefit;
(c) provide for stewardship of the public assets of its community; and
(d) foster the economic, social and environmental well-being of its
community;
2. The Vancouver Charter is the principal statute setting out the powers of the City
of Vancouver and provides that Council may provide for good rule and
government (Sec 189);
3. The Vancouver Charter (Sec 162A) also provides that Council may appoint a
Board of Administration and delegate to such Board any of the executive or
administrative powers exercisable by the Council;
4. The current Board of Administration By-Law No. 4017 defines the Board’s
powers and duties, consists of one person bearing the title of City Manager, and
has not been updated since 1992;
5. Vancouver City Council is on the cusp of hiring a new City Manager and a
successful governance-management relationship is critical to the organization’s
success;
6. Leadership-Focused Governance views “organizational governance” – the
combined roles of governing and managing – as a partnership between the
Board [Council] and the Chief Executive, in which the Board focusses on
governing, and the Chief Executive on management and operations;
7. Several guidance documents point to the importance of good governance in the
public sector, including the Auditor General of British Columbia's Public Sector
Governance: A Guide to the Principles of Good Governance (2008), which
identifies five underpinning principles: accountability, leadership, integrity,
stewardship, and transparency; and
8. Council is committed to good governance in both word and action.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to review the existing
governance policy framework, including the Board of Administration By-Law and other

Council Meeting
Minutes, April 13, 2021 21
governance-management linkages, with direction to staff to develop policy and
procedures for the governance orientation and training of incoming Council members,
including respective roles and responsibilities;
FURTHER THAT, in developing this framework it shall include, but not be limited to, the
onboarding process for Council members as well as the ongoing development of Council
members throughout a Council’s 4-year term;
AND FURTHER THAT Council direct staff to report back on the aforementioned work in
Q2 2022.
