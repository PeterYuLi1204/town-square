MOVED by Councillor Boyle
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. An increasing number of residents in Vancouver are struggling to find stable,
secure housing at a rate that is affordable for local incomes. Renters, including
seniors, people with disabilities, single parent (often female-led) households,
youth, and Indigenous communities are particularly squeezed by this housing
crisis, and are in even greater need of being able to access secure, affordable
housing;

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, December 07, 2022 8
2. In addition, the need for accessible and adaptable rental housing for seniors and
people with disabilities, at prices that are affordable to middle and low-income
residents, is significant and will increase even further over the next two decades;
3. Vancouver’s housing market has seen significant increases in land values and
housing costs, pricing a growing number of residents out of the housing market.
The escalation of home prices has also led to significant displacement,
particularly of renters, and low and middle-income residents, and has made it
increasingly difficult for local businesses to hire and retain staff;
4. Complete, walkable communities rely on essential workers such as health care
workers and grocery store clerks, who should have the opportunity to work near
their jobs, rather than having to commute long distances to get to their jobs.
Research suggests that mixed-income communities have better outcomes for all
residents (not just low-income residents) because of a greater access to
services;
5. The Housing Vancouver Strategy (2018-2027) includes a target of 12,000 new
social, supportive and coop homes by 2027. The City is also committed to
partnering with Indigenous organizations to deliver culturally appropriate housing
developments. The high number of households in Vancouver paying over 30% of
their income in rent indicates that more non-profit, co-op, and social housing is
needed;
6. We are in a window of strong alignment between Federal and Provincial
governments in terms of developing affordable and non-profit housing. The
National Housing Strategy is set to expire in 2027, and currently running out of
capital contributions in the Co-Investment Fund. Some of these senior
government funding programs require approved zoning for eligibility. Having
appropriate municipal zoning in place, and streamlining wherever we can, allows
non-profit and co-op housing providers to access this senior government funding
much more easily, speeding up timelines and achieving deeper levels of
affordability;
7. The Community Housing sector, made up of non-profit and co-op housing
providers, is an important partner in the provision of affordable non-market
housing across Vancouver, and the sector’s capacity in Vancouver has grown
significantly over recent years;
8. Housing created in partnership with the community housing sector is “speculation
free” housing because of the sector’s mission driven focus on maximizing
affordability, and the ability to place covenants on non-profit buildings that
prevent sale for profit;

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, December 07, 2022 9
9. The City’s definition of social housing in the Zoning and Development By-law
requires the housing be owned and operated on a not-for-profit basis by
non-profit housing societies, co-op, or government agencies. And it requires a
minimum of 30% of the units to be occupied by households with incomes below
Housing Income Limits (HILs) set out by the Province. This means that no profit
is generated, and it allows flexibility to cross-subsidize units. Many new
developments rely on mixed-income housing models, with a mix of affordability
levels to cover costs, typically with affordability deepening over time or
deepening through access to senior government funding. Many non-market and
co-op developments exceed the 30% HILs minimum, and will be even better
positioned to do through this approach;
10. City staff analysis has demonstrated that half of recent social housing
developments have required rezoning through a public hearing process,
compared to less than a third of market condominium development. Single
detached homes do not require a public hearing, even when a new detached
home is significantly larger and more expensive than the one it is replacing. The
added time and cost of requiring a public hearing impacts what type of housing
gets built, and it is currently not aligned with what type of housing is most
needed;
11. Rezoning for a non-profit typically takes a year or longer, and can add
approximately $500,000-$1,000,000 onto the cost of a project, as well as
requiring significant municipal staff time. This results in rents that are higher at
occupancy and/or means that limited capital subsidies from senior levels of
government get expended more quickly, meaning less housing overall. Reducing
the cost, time and risk required to build non-profit and coop housing will result in
savings for Vancouver residents and deeper affordability in the new housing
created;
12. Major redevelopments still include opportunities for public engagement. Even
when they don’t require a public hearing, the Development Permit process
includes public notification and opportunities for comment, and could still require
a Development Permit Hearing process, providing residents an opportunity to
address the Development Permit Board in a public meeting;
13. Vancouver’s Tenant Relocation and Protection Policy, updated by Council in
2019, outlines specific protections for tenants in the case of a redevelopment for
non-profit housing. These protections are more stringent than for for-profit market
development. Additional direction was given through the Vancouver Plan to
continue strengthening tenant protections for renters and co-op residents city
wide;

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, December 07, 2022 10
14. At Public Hearing on April 20th, 2021, Council unanimously approved
recommendations to allow development of up to six stories in the RM-3A and the
RM-4 and RM-4N zoning districts where 100% of the residential floor area is
developed as social housing or social housing in conjunction with a child day
care facility;
15. At the above Public Hearing, numerous local experts in non-profit and co-op
housing expressed a need for Council to be more ambitious in terms of both
height and FSR to give non-profit housing providers the flexibility to optimize the
number and affordability of new homes possible on each site. In response, City
legal and planning staff outlined that significant amendments at the Public
Hearing stage are not ideal, and that if Council wanted to be more ambitious in
this regard, a preferable route would be through a separate Council motion;
16. In a Women Transforming Cities municipal election survey in 2022, a majority of
incoming Council members answered yes to the following question:
Will you commit to reducing barriers to providing non-market housing by
delegating authority to city staff to approve non-profit, co-op, and social housing
initiatives of up to 12 stories in multi-family areas, and up to six stories in other
residential areas, without a rezoning requirement?
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to bring forward recommendations for Council to
consider referring to Public Hearing that would delegate authority to City staff to
approve developments of up to 12 stories (with a corresponding increase in FSR)
in the RM-3A and the RM-4 and RM-4N zoning districts where 100% of the
residential floor area is developed as social housing (coop, non-profit and non-
market housing), or social housing in conjunction with a child day care facility.
B. THAT Council direct staff to report back on considerations and recommendations
for allowing additional height and FSR in other zoning districts (including RS, RT,
RM, and mixed commercial-residential zones) where 100% of the residential floor
area is developed as social housing (coop, non-profit and non-market housing),
or social housing in conjunction with a child day care facility. And that this work
be prioritized within the Vancouver Plan implementation;
FURTHER THAT Council direct staff to report back with changes to current
Tenant Relocation and Protection Policy for Non-Market Housing Development
(3.1) consistent with the Tenant Protection for Market Rental Housing
Development (2.1) in order to provide an option for financial compensation based
on length of tenancy, where pre-existing market tenancies have been purchased
by a non-market or social housing provider for the purpose of redevelopment.
C. THAT Council direct staff to engage with the community housing sector on
clarifications or changes related to the city’s definition of social housing in order

Minutes, Wednesday, December 07, 2022 11
to strengthen public understanding and trust, without creating barriers to
developing community housing at break-even rents with no funding from senior
levels of government.

positioned to do through this approach;
10. City staff analysis has demonstrated that half of recent social housing
developments have required rezoning through a public hearing process,
compared to less than a third of market condominium development. Single
detached homes do not require a public hearing, even when a new detached
home is significantly larger and more expensive than the one it is replacing. The
added time and cost of requiring a public hearing impacts what type of housing
gets built, and it is currently not aligned with what type of housing is most
needed;
11. Rezoning for a non-profit typically takes a year or longer, and can add
approximately $500,000-$1,000,000 onto the cost of a project, as well as
requiring significant municipal staff time. This results in rents that are higher at
occupancy and/or means that limited capital subsidies from senior levels of
government get expended more quickly, meaning less housing overall. Reducing
the cost, time and risk required to build non-profit and coop housing will result in
savings for Vancouver residents and deeper affordability in the new housing
created;
12. Major redevelopments still include opportunities for public engagement. Even
when they don’t require a public hearing, the Development Permit process
includes public notification and opportunities for comment, and could still require
a Development Permit Hearing process, providing residents an opportunity to
address the Development Permit Board in a public meeting;
13. Vancouver’s Tenant Relocation and Protection Policy, updated by Council in
2019, outlines specific protections for tenants in the case of a redevelopment for
non-profit housing. These protections are more stringent than for for-profit market
development. Additional direction was given through the Vancouver Plan to
continue strengthening tenant protections for renters and co-op residents city
wide;
14. At Public Hearing on April 20th, 2021, Council unanimously approved
recommendations to allow development of up to six stories in the RM-3A and the
RM-4 and RM-4N zoning districts where 100% of the residential floor area is
developed as social housing or social housing in conjunction with a child day
care facility;
15. At the above Public Hearing, numerous local experts in non-profit and co-op
housing expressed a need for Council to be more ambitious in terms of both
height and FSR to give non-profit housing providers the flexibility to optimize the
number and affordability of new homes possible on each site. In response, City

Minutes, Wednesday, December 07, 2022 16
legal and planning staff outlined that significant amendments at the Public
Hearing stage are not ideal, and that if Council wanted to be more ambitious in
this regard, a preferable route would be through a separate Council motion;
16. In a Women Transforming Cities municipal election survey in 2022, a majority of
incoming Council members answered yes to the following question:
Will you commit to reducing barriers to providing non-market housing by
delegating authority to city staff to approve non-profit, co-op, and social housing
initiatives of up to 12 stories in multi-family areas, and up to six stories in other
residential areas, without a rezoning requirement?
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council affirm its commitment to reducing the barriers to providing
non-market housing in the city and direct staff to bring forward
recommendations and analysis for Council to consider toward enabling
the delegation of authority to City staff to approve developments of up to
12 stories (with a corresponding increase in FSR), as already
contemplated in the Vancouver Plan, in the RM-3A and the RM-4 and RM-
4N zoning districts where 100% of the residential floor area is developed
as social housing (coop, non-profit and non-market housing), or social
housing in conjunction with a child day care facility;
FURTHER THAT Council shall, upon receiving and considering staff’s
recommendations and advice toward reducing the barriers to providing
non-market housing in the city, give consideration to referring the matter to
a Public Hearing within the context of the Vancouver Plan planning
framework.
B. THAT Council direct staff to report back on considerations, feasibility, and
recommendations for allowing additional height and FSR in other zoning
districts (including RS, RT, RM, and mixed commercial-residential zones)
where 100% of the residential floor area is developed as social housing
(coop, non-profit and non-market housing), or social housing in
conjunction with a child day care facility, including recommendations for
how this work could potentially be prioritized within the Vancouver Plan
implementation framework.
C. THAT Council direct staff to report back with analysis and potential
changes to the City’s current Tenant Relocation and Protection Policy for
Non-Market Housing Development (3.1) – including any unintended
impact on new housing viability and affordability – consistent with the
Tenant Protection for Market Rental Housing Development (2.1) in order
to provide potential options for financial compensation based on length of

Minutes, Wednesday, December 07, 2022 17
tenancy, where pre-existing market tenancies have been purchased by a
non-market or social housing provider for the purpose of redevelopment.
D. THAT Council direct and otherwise empower staff to engage with the
community housing sector on potential clarifications and/or changes
related to the city’s definition of social housing in order to improve the
policy and strengthen public understanding and trust, without inadvertently
creating barriers to developing community housing at break-even rents
where there is no funding from senior levels of government;
FURTHER THAT staff report back on the impacts of a revised definition of
social housing that would be distinct from other government partners, and
the impact that it may have on accessing funding streams and securing
housing investment from senior levels of government.
E. THAT Council direct staff to include specific answers to the following
questions relative to clauses A, B, C, and D above in the various staff
recommendations, analysis, and reports back to Council as noted:
a. Do any actions contemplated in clauses A, B, C, or D above
complicate, interfere with, compromise, undermine, and/or contradict
any staff actions and/or plans currently underway such as the
Vancouver Plan and the Broadway Plan in ways that would require
staff and staff resources to be diverted away from existing work,
notably staff diverted away from work already underway in the
development of an Official Community Plan (OCP) for the city that is
also anticipated to streamline rezoning processes and timelines?
b. Are there any current and/or ongoing staff actions or efforts to increase
housing that could be negatively and/or unintentionally impacted or
slowed by the actions contemplated in this motion? For example,
current work by staff to clear the City’s significant housing approval
backlog.
c. Are BC Hydro and other utilities such as sewer, and water able to
accommodate the housing shift contemplated in this motion?
d. What impact will the shift contemplated in this motion have on
Vancouver’s tree canopy and efforts to address climate change and
the inequity evident from heat mapping data for the city?
e. What are the potential approaches that can be employed to mitigate
any land price inflation and additional speculation that could result from
the block up zoning contemplated in the motion?

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, December 07, 2022 18
f. What does the delegation of “final approval” to staff in this motion entail
in the context of the actions contemplated in clauses A, B, C, and/or D
in terms of process, and do staff believe that delegating authority to
staff will materially reduce approval times?
g. Do the actions and changes contemplated in this motion support and
appropriately fit helpfully into a clear, overarching citywide housing
plan?
8. Establishing Fixed-Rate Community Amenity Contributions (CACs) for Low-Rise
and Medium-Rise Projects City-Wide (Members’ Motion B.3)
At the Council meeting on December 6, 2022, Council referred this motion to the Standing
Committee on Policy and Strategic Priorities meeting on December 7, 2022, in order to hear
from speakers, followed by debate and decision.
The Committee heard from one speaker in support of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. Vancouver is supported by an extensive network of public benefits (i.e. amenities
and infrastructure). These public benefits play a large role in making Vancouver
one of the most liveable cities in the world and help to support new residents,
employees and visitors to the city;
2. The City strives to maintain its existing assets in an appropriate state of repair,
but also expand its network of public benefits to address population and
employment growth. Community Amenity Contributions (CACs) are one of the
sources of funds to achieve these objectives;
3. The Community Amenity Contributions Policy for Rezonings sets out the City’s
policies around how Community Amenity Contributions (CACs) are determined,
allocated and spent;
4. Currently, specific CAC policy areas apply to locations with their own CAC and/or
public benefit policies. For all rezonings in the area-specific CAC policies, the
CAC is determined through a CAC target and/or negotiated approach. For all
rezonings not determined through a CAC target, the CAC is determined through
a negotiated approach;
5. The City’s current process for negotiated CACs can be lengthy and adds risk and
cost uncertainties for housing providers. Fixed-rate CACs have proven to be a
more streamlined approach for many projects. They not only speed up the
delivery of urgently needed housing in the city, they simultaneously reduce risk

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, December 07, 2022 19
and cost uncertainties for housing providers that are seeking to build new
housing in the city; and
6. In the Fall of 2022, City staff began a review of CAC targets based on economic
testing to ensure the rates are aligned with market conditions. Any changes to
these rates will be brought to Council for consideration in early to mid-2023, and
if approved would take effect September 30, 2023. i
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to report back by the end of
Q1 2023 with a plan to implement fixed-rate Community Amenity Contributions (CACs)
for low-rise and medium-rise projects city-wide, including any current information
relevant to staff work on CAC targets.

9. Reviewing Vancouver’s Age-Friendly Action Plan and Aligning with WHO’s
Age-Friendly Cities Framework (Members’ Motion B.4)
At the Council meeting on December 6, 2022, Council referred this motion to the Standing
Committee on Policy and Strategic Priorities meeting on December 7, 2022, in order to hear
from speakers, followed by debate and decision.
The Committee heard from five speakers in support of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Klassen
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. The World Health Organization (WHO) Age-friendly Cities framework is a policy
tool that helps to identify and address barriers to the well-being and participation
of older adults in cities. The Age-friendly Cities framework is divided into eight
interconnected domains of urban life that overlap and interact with each other in
terms of the accessibility of public buildings and spaces and the range of
opportunities that a city offers to older adults for social participation,
entertainment, volunteering, and/or employment; i
2. An age-friendly city encourages active ageing by optimizing opportunities for
health, participation and security in order to enhance quality of life as people age.
In practical terms, an age-friendly city adapts its structures and services to be
accessible to and inclusive of older adults with varying needs and capacities;

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, December 07, 2022 20
3. “Population ageing and urbanization are two global trends that together comprise
major forces shaping the 21st century. At the same time as cities are growing,
their share of residents aged 60 years and more is increasing. Older adults are a
resource for their families, communities and economies in supportive and
enabling living environments.” (Global Age-friendly Cities: A Guide – © World
Health Organization 2007);
4. The City of Vancouver has an Age-friendly Action Plan, the goal of which is to
make Vancouver a safe, inclusive, and engaging city for seniors; ii
5. The City of Vancouver’s Age-friendly Action Plan has a series of 60-plus actions
the City designed to help make Vancouver a more safe, inclusive, and engaging
city for seniors, namely by seeking to improve facilities and services for seniors
across the full spectrum – from fully independent older adults and seniors, to
those who are more vulnerable and need additional support;
6. The City of Vancouver has a Seniors’ Advisory Committee which was established
by a Council resolution under the authority of the Vancouver Charter section 159;
7. The mandate of the Seniors' Advisory Committee is to advise Council and staff
on enhancing access and inclusion for seniors, the elderly, and their families to
fully participate in City services and civic life. The Seniors' Advisory Committee
identifies and suggests solutions to gaps and barriers that impede the full
participation of seniors and the elderly in all aspects of city life;
8. The Seniors' Advisory Committee produces an annual work plan with specific
objectives by April of each year, in consultation with Council and staff liaisons, for
distribution to Council and civic departments for information. The Committee
submits an annual report to Council describing its accomplishments for the year,
including reference to each objective set out in the work plan and any arising
issues to which the committee has responded;
9. The Seniors’ Advisory Committee (SAC) Report of Activities, 2021–2022, for the
period of May 18, 2021, to November 6, 2022, includes sixteen high priority
recommendations for the Incoming SAC and Council and also makes note of the
United Nations Decade of Healthy Ageing (2021–2030), “a global collaboration,
aligned with the last ten years of the Sustainable Development Goals, that brings
together governments, civil society, international agencies, professionals,
academia, the media, and the private sector to improve the lives of older adults,
their families, and the communities in which they live.”;
10. Embedded within the sixteen high priority recommendations from Seniors'
Advisory Committee, in context with a notation re: the United Nations Decade of
Healthy Ageing (2021–2030), is an observation that the City of Vancouver
currently “lacks strategic comprehensive planning for Ageing in Community and
the Continuum of Care with government and community partners.” The
Committee recommends that “As planning and implementation of an age-friendly
city matures further work should be advanced in supporting dementia care and
participating in the compassionate city charter.”

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, December 07, 2022 21
11. Societies benefit greatly from the significant contributions seniors make to our
cities and communities and every effort should be made to ensure cities have
safe streets and sidewalks and more inclusive and accessible facilities and
services;
12. It is incumbent upon the incoming Mayor and Council to reflect upon and review
the City’s Age-friendly Action Plan, in concert with the advent of United Nations
Decade of Healthy Ageing (2021–2030) and other age-friendly initiatives and
trends, to refresh and reinvigorate the scope and objectives of the City’s
Age-friendly Action Plan and ensure alignment with current best practices and
emerging global standards such as the World Health Organization (WHO)
Age-friendly Cities framework.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to prepare a report and
presentation on the City’s Age-friendly Action Plan on or before the end of Q1 of 2023,
including information on its current status, accomplishments to date, current challenges,
and emerging issues, in consultation with the City’s Seniors’ Advisory Committee and
other relevant stakeholders;
FURTHER THAT Council direct staff to include specific information in the report relating
to the potential to align with and/or adopt the World Health Organization (WHO)
Age-friendly Cities framework and any other relevant and/or emerging global standards
and best practices.

10. Harmonizing City of Vancouver and Provincial Childcare Policies and Licensing
Requirements (Members’ Motion B.5)
At the Council meeting on December 6, 2022, Council referred this motion to the Standing
Committee on Policy and Strategic Priorities meeting on December 7, 2022, in order to hear
from speakers, followed by debate and decision.
The Committee heard from six speakers in opposition to the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Dominato

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, December 07, 2022 22
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. Childcare is vital to life in our city. Childcare allows parents and guardians to
work, receive education and training, and to participate in and contribute to their
communities. Childcare helps to give children a good start in life, setting them up
for thriving in schools and improved lifelong physical and mental health;
2. The City of Vancouver has a long term vision whereby all Vancouver families can
access affordable, quality, and inclusive childcare and be able to work, learn, or
meet other daily needs as part of a universal, public system;
3. During the decades of limited senior government coordination and grant funding
for childcare, the City stepped forward to facilitate the development of a core
supply of stable, secured licensed group childcare facilities; supporting access to
quality childcare for local families, capacity-building of the non-profit sector, and
advocating greater involvement of senior governments in childcare;
4. Since the late 1970s, City investments and partnerships have facilitated the
creation of more than 4,500 licensed non-profit childcare spaces in Vancouver,
with a focus on purpose built full-day care serving children younger than school
age;
5. In 1990, in order to maintain a consistent standard across childcare facilities,
Council adopted a set of Childcare Design Guidelines;
6. Childcare is an essential service and part of the City’s plans to create complete
neighbourhoods. City-facilitated childcare spaces are developed and supported
through partnerships and a variety of funding tools, including development cost
levies (DCL) and community amenity contributions (CAC);
7. The City has a 10-year Childcare Strategy – “Making Strides” – which aims to
support access to a new universal system of early care and learning led by the
provincial and federal governments;
8. Less than half of families seeking licensed childcare in Vancouver today can find
a full time space;
9. In alignment with new provincial and federal commitments to deliver universal
childcare, the City will continue to work with local partners to identify sites and
opportunities to accelerate childcare space creation and to coordinate policies,
while also focusing on ways to streamline planning to enable the timely delivery
of childcare spaces;
10. Given the provincial and federal government commitments to a universal system
of childcare and early learning, it is essential for the City to align and set strategic
policy directions, goals, and action planning for the next decade to support senior
governments in the delivery of a universal childcare system that meets the needs
of families in the City; and

11. Currently, the City’s policies and design guidelines related to the creation of new
childcare spaces are not aligned with provincial regulations, constraining the
City’s ability to deliver much needed childcare.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to initiate a process with their
Provincial counterparts to harmonize and otherwise align the City’s childcare policies
and childcare design guidelines with those of the Province to more efficiently and
effectively enable a greater number of childcare spaces in the city of Vancouver and at a
more rapid pace;

11. Implementing Body-Worn Cameras (BWC) for the Vancouver Police Department
(VPD) (Members’ Motion B.6)
At the Council meeting on December 6, 2022, Council referred this motion to the Standing
Committee on Policy and Strategic Priorities meeting on December 7, 2022, in order to hear
from speakers, followed by debate and decision.
The Committee heard from two speakers in support of the motion and two speakers in
opposition to the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Zhou
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. The Vancouver Police Department (VPD) is a diverse and innovative police
department. The VPD is guided by its core values of integrity, compassion,
accountability, respect, and excellence (ICARE);
2. The VPD has over 1,000,000 contacts with the public every year, including
approximately 240,000 calls for service every year, or over 650 calls per day;
3. Police officers in B.C. have many layers of accountability, including multiple
independent civilian oversight bodies. The VPD welcomes police oversight and it
is appropriate and necessary given the powers granted to them as peace
officers;

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, December 07, 2022 28
4. The Police Act provides statutory authority to the government to develop and
implement police standards and to evaluate compliance of these standards,
which include training, use of force (e.g., firearms, intermediate weapons, and
restraints), and standards for equipment including body worn cameras; i
5. BC’s Provincial Policing Standards re: Equipment and Facilities (4.2.1 – Body
Worn Cameras) defines a “Body Worn Camera” (BWC) as “a wearable video and
audio recording system.”;
6. There is now an extensive body of academic research on BWC and its
applications. It has shown to decrease the number of public complaints against
police officers as well as to decrease the use of force by police officers. The
benefits associated with BWC must be weighed against privacy implications; ii
7. In 2014, a Special Committee of the Legislative Assembly of B.C. was
empowered to Review the Independent Investigations Office (IIO) and to
examine and make recommendations with respect to the administration and
general operations of the Independent Investigations Office in accordance with
section 38.13 of the Police Act [RSBC 1996] c. 367;
8. In February 2015, the Special Committee released its report which included a
recommendation that “The provincial government aggressively pursue the steps
necessary to implement the police use of body-worn cameras, in consultation
with police and non-police stakeholders.”;
9. In response to questions from the Special Committee regarding the usefulness of
BWC, the IIO Chief Civilian Director stated that “such devices were becoming
increasingly common in other jurisdictions, particularly in the US, and that
evidence from these jurisdictions suggested that body worn cameras could assist
certain IIO investigative files, including emergency response team deployments,
police dog handling issues, and conducted energy weapon incidents.”;
10. In statements made to B.C.’s Special Committee on Reforming the Police Act,
VPD Chief Constable Adam Palmer advocated for BWC to be in-stated as part of
a provincial policing standard. He supported the deployment of BWC as a tool to
strengthen public trust and confidence in police;
11. The provincial government has established policing standards for the deployment
of BWC, including direction that “Prior to deploying body-worn cameras (BWC) to
any of its officers, the chief constable, chief officer, or commissioner; and if
required under the police force’s policies or guidelines, the Police Board must –
among other things – ensure that a privacy impact assessment (PIA) has been
completed and approved by the appropriate head of the public body, that
information about the police force’s use of BWC is available to the public on the
police force’s website, that a written policy exists which covers at minimum that
only BWCs issued by the police force are permitted to be used and the
circumstances under which a BWC is permitted to be used to record an
encounter, and procedures for ensuring that any potential disclosure of BWC
video is consistent with applicable provincial or federal privacy legislation; iii

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, December 07, 2022 29
12. The purpose of the BC Provincial Policing Standards for Body Worn Cameras is
to ensure consistency and guide police agencies on how to implement this
technology;
13. The cost associated with BWC is often cited as a barrier to
implementation. These costs include not only significant costs associated
with acquiring the equipment, but also ongoing cost of administration,
maintenance, data storage, transcription and disclosure. It is important to
understand the full scope of implementing and maintaining a BWC
program and the significant investment of public funds involved;
14. The VPD has an authorized strength of 1348 sworn officers. Of these,
approximately 800 officers are assigned to front-line duties and would be the
most appropriate to be equipped with BWC (NOTE: Not all front-line officers are
on duty at the same time. The number of cameras required would be reflective of
the number of on-duty officers);
15. Nationally, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) is currently rolling out
BWC to their officers across the country. Between 10,000 - 15,000 body-worn
cameras will be deployed to RCMP officers across Canada starting with a field
test of 300 BWC in three different RCMP Divisions;
16. Public Safety Canada has estimated the annual per unit cost for the RCMP’s
BWC and Digital Evidence Management System (DEMS) program to be
$2,000 - $3,000 annually. The annual subscription is expected to include
software and data storage (as part of the DEMS system) and the yearly
subscription cost for BWCs; iv
17. The 2015-2016 IIO Annual Report noted a review of 71 IIO investigations to
determine whether the availability of BWC footage could have assisted in
expediting and concluding these investigations. The review concluded that BWC
footage would have potentially assisted in resolving 93% of the investigations
sooner and potentially led to corresponding cost savings, as well as reducing
stress for complainants and respondent officers; and
18. Given that the RCMP is currently rolling out a nation-wide BWC program, along
with the provincial government’s endorsement of BWC for police departments in
the province, the opportunity for Mayor and Council to support and otherwise
take steps to enable the VPD to implement BWC for all front-line and patrol
officers by 2025, is timely and warranted.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council formally support and take steps to enable the VPD to implement a
“Body Worn Camera” (BWC) program that will equip all front-line and patrol
officers by 2025.

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, December 07, 2022 30
B. THAT Council direct the Mayor to write to the Vancouver Police Board on behalf
of Council indicating support for the implementation of a “Body Worn Camera”
(BWC) program in Vancouver;
FURTHER THAT the Mayor’s letter be sent to the Vancouver Police Union,
B.C.’s Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General, and all other relevant
partners and stakeholders.
C. THAT Council direct staff to work with the VPD and other relevant partners and
stakeholders to identify the costs to implement and sustain a “Body Worn
Camera” (BWC) program for all VPD front-line and patrol officers by 2025, as
well as funding options and opportunities for implementing and sustaining a BWC
program;
FURTHER THAT staff be directed to report back to Council with information and
recommendations in early 2024.

ii The Supreme Court of Canada has noted that an individual does not automatically forfeit his or her
privacy interests when in public, especially given technological developments that make it possible for
personal information “to be recorded with ease, distributed to an almost infinite audience, and stored
indefinitely”. And as the Supreme Court added more recently, the right to informational privacy includes
anonymity which “permits individuals to act in public places but to preserve freedom from identification
and surveillance.” https://www.priv.gc.ca/media/1984/gd_bwc_201502_e.pdf
iii Under privacy legislation, law enforcement agencies are responsible for protecting personal information
from unauthorized access or use, disclosure, copying, modification and destruction, as well as loss and
theft. Reasonable steps must be taken to safeguard recordings.

iv As part of the RCMP's Vision150 modernization plan, the force is rolling out body-worn cameras
(BWCs) and a Digital Evidence Management System (DEMS) to RCMP officers across the country.
Between 10,000 -15,000 body-worn cameras will be deployed to contract and federal police officers who
interact with communities, across Canada's rural, urban and remote locations, starting with a field test
with up to 300 cameras in three different RCMP Divisions (https://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/en/body-worn-
cameras). The federal government’s 2020 Fall Economic Statement committed $238.5 million over six
years towards BWC. Part of this financial commitment includes fully funding the RCMP initiative until
2024/25, at which point contract partners will absorb all costs. https://www.ubcm.ca/about-ubcm/latest-
