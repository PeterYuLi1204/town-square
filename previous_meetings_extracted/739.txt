4. Mandatory Mask Policy for Vancouver Civic Facilities (Member’s Motion B.2)
At the Council meeting on October 20, 2020, Council referred the following motion to the
Standing Committee on City Finance and Services meeting on October 22, 2020, in order to
hear from speakers.
The Committee heard from 15 speakers in opposition of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Boyle
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. The COVID-19 pandemic impact has been significant causing many residents to
severely curtail their activities to adhere to physical distancing and health
guidelines. This has and continues to impact people’s daily lives and social and
mental well-being;
2. Municipalities across Canada are adopting new policies requiring masks to be
worn in all civic facilities including city halls, libraries, recreation and culture
facilities. Delta Council unanimously adopted a mask policy to take effect
October 1 as did Richmond at Committee with the final Council vote slated for
October 13;
3. Other public serving agencies have also introduced mandatory face mask
policies including TransLink, BC Transit and BC Ferries and compliance has
been high to date;
4. A recent Simon Fraser University study looking at mask mandates across
Ontario’s 34 public health units over a two-month period this summer found the
policies were associated with a 25 per cent or larger drop in weekly cases. The
study has not yet been peer-reviewed;
5. While the Province has not implemented a mandatory mask policy, the Provincial
Health Officer recommends wearing masks indoors where distancing may be
challenging, or where people may be for extended periods of time, as a good,
preventive measure;
6. With the fall upon us and winter approaching, people will naturally be spending
more time indoors;
7. The City of Vancouver and Vancouver Park Board closed all civic facilities in
March in response to COVID-19 and a civic declared emergency including civic
theatres, libraries, community centres and recreation facilities. These have been
gradually reopening as the City, Vancouver Park Board and Vancouver Public
Library work towards a return of services. These services play a vital role in the
mental, physical and social well-being of residents;
8. The impact of a second significant shutdown in the City (and Province) would
have devastating impacts on small business and residents;

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Thursday, October 22, 2020 11
9. The City has a key role to play in leading by example with safe operations
protocols as we continue through COVID-19 and work towards recovery; and
10. The City also has an obligation to support the health and safety of its frontline
staff.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council endorse a mandatory mask policy and direct staff to initiate a
mandatory mask policy for the duration of the COVID-19 response and recovery
as soon as possible for Vancouver Civic facilities.
B. THAT the policy include exemptions for children under five, persons with
disabilities and persons with underlying medical conditions that may inhibit them
from being able to wear masks.
C. THAT staff work with non-profit partners and/or utilize senior government Covid
restart funding to provide masks to support persons who may not be able to
afford them.
D. THAT the policy be widely communicated through social media, communications
and on-site signage at relevant facilities to raise awareness and ask the public for
compliance should they wish to utilize civic facilities.
E. THAT subject to approval of the above, this motion be sent to the Vancouver
Park Board, Vancouver Public Library Board, Vancouver Civic Theatres Board
and PNE Board for their consideration and encouragement to adopt a mandatory
mask policy for civic facilities under their respective jurisdictions.
amended
AMENDMENT MOVED by Councillor Boyle
THAT the recommendations be struck and replaced with the following:
A. THAT Council support a “strongly encourage” approach to mask wearing
at City facilities for the duration of the COVID-19 response and recovery,
and direct staff to enhance messaging and signage to strongly encourage
mask wearing.
B. THAT Council direct staff to work with non-profit, health authority or
senior government partners, seek donations, or consider City funds, to
ensure masks are available at City facilities for those who may not be
able to afford them.
C. THAT Council direct staff to ensure City staff are well supported and
provided with appropriate personal protective equipment to keep them
protected in their places of work, particularly given variation on the types

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Thursday, October 22, 2020 12
of work and ranges of interaction with the public that City staff are
engaged in during this pandemic.
D. THAT Council direct staff to develop an implementation plan in the event
Public Health Authorities recommend moving to a “mandatory mask”
approach, and that Council support that change if it is the
recommendation of public health.
carried
At 9:47 pm, during discussions, Councillor Hardwick rose on a point of order pursuant to Section
8.7(f) of the Procedure By-law that the amendment be ruled out of order as the
recommendations are already in place.
Subsequently after conferring with the City Manager, the Chair ruled that the amendment was in
order as the recommendations are not currently in place.
* * * * *
At 9:52 pm, during discussions, it was
MOVED by Councillor Bligh
THAT the meeting be extended past 10 pm in order complete the business of the
Committee and to convene and complete the business of the Council portion following
