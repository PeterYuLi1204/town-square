COUNCIL MEMBERS’ MOTIONS
1. Declaring Housing as a Human Right
The Committee heard from four speakers who spoke in support of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Orr
SECONDED by Councillor Fry
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. Vancouver and British Columbia struggle with an ongoing housing crisis. From
skyrocketing rents to expanding encampments, the failure to provide adequate
and affordable housing has become one of the province’s most pressing human
rights issues;

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, June 4, 2025 17
2. Housing as a Human Right has been legislated in Canada at the federal level
since 2019 and is included in the National Housing Strategy. This legislation is
Canada’s commitment to recognizing the right to housing under international
human rights law, and means governments must ensure that the housing system
enables everyone to live somewhere in security, peace and dignity;
3. The responsibility and jurisdiction in Canada for delivery of housing is primarily
with the provinces. Over the course of a decade British Columbia can expect
hundreds of millions of dollars in transfer funds and other incentives from the
federal government to administer towards the delivery of housing, predicated in
part by the commitment to housing as a human right; and
4. The recognition of housing as a human right leads to more effective, equitable
housing policy. Local governments across British Columbia are united in calling
for the province to declare housing as a human right.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
THAT the City of Vancouver submit the following resolution by June 15, 2025, for
consideration at UBCM’s 2025 Policy Convention.
Declaring Housing as a Human Right
WHEREAS recognizing housing as a human right fundamentally shifts
government motivations by adding critical urgency and responsibility to ensure
access to affordable housing (meaning housing costs are aligned with income)
through policies that prevent homelessness, address the escalating housing and
homelessness crisis, eliminate discrimination, and prioritize the needs of
vulnerable and marginalized populations;
AND WHEREAS the Government of Canada affirmed the right to housing as a
matter of international law and enshrined it domestically through the National
Housing Strategy Act (2019), recognizing housing as a human right and
establishing mechanisms for accountability and inclusion:
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
THAT the UBCM call for the BC Government to enshrine housing as a human
right in legislation and forthcoming housing and homelessness strategies,
ensuring that housing policy in British Columbia is grounded in principles of
equity, accessibility, accountability, and the inherent dignity of all people.
CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY (Vote No. 10760)
(Councillor Klassen absent for the vote)
2. Protecting Renters by Establishing a Tenant Advocacy Office

* * * * *
MOVED by Councillor Maloney
SECONDED by Councillor Fry
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. At the date of the 2021 census, renter households represented 54.5% of
Vancouver households (Canada Census 2021);
2. The overall rental vacancy rate is 1.6%, which was the highest rate measured in
the past 10 years, except in 2020, and the market remains relatively tight
especially in lower-priced segments (CMHC 2024);
3. In 2021, 39.4% of renter households were spending more than 30% of pre-tax
total income on housing and therefore their housing is not considered affordable.
(Canada Census 2021);
4. The City of Vancouver no longer has a department dedicated to tracking,
resourcing, and supporting Vancouver renters and renter issues;
5. As the Broadway Plan progresses, and buildings elsewhere in the City require
redevelopment it will be increasingly important that dedicated staff follow up on
issues in a timely way. Proactive monitoring and intervention is likely to reduce
stress and uncertainty for tenants and possibly prevent some tenants from being
tipped into homelessness. There are currently Planning staff assigned to follow
up on complaints regarding Tenant Relocation Plan (TRP) compliance as a core
function of their roles. Strengthening and better connecting these staff through a
tenant advocacy office could increase the impact of this work;
6. 30% of older adults in the City rent their homes and as of the last City of
Vancouver homeless count, 21% of people counted were over 55 years old and
almost half first experienced homelessness when they were already a senior
(City of Vancouver 2024);
7. Indigenous people are also more likely to be renters and face adverse rental
experiences. Indigenous renters in BC face increased rates of eviction and
eviction into homelessness than the non-Indigenous population. In addition,
many existing buildings supporting Indigenous people at affordable rents need
significant repairs. (Indigenous Housing Needs Data Resource Library);

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, June 4, 2025 19
8. Council allocates a number of Renter Services Grants to organisations such as
Tenant Resource & Advisory Centre (TRAC), however neither TRAC nor the BC
Residential Tenancy Branch (RTB) are able to enforce tenant protections
particular to the City of Vancouver, including agreements entered into by tenants
covered by protections included in the Broadway Plan. There is an existing group
of staff tasked with monitoring TRP compliance, including the Broadway TRP.
Strengthening and better connecting these staff through a tenant advocacy office
could increase the impact of this work; and
9. While the approval and development of dedicated rental accommodation
provides more stable housing for renters, this alone is insufficient to protect
renters, given the breadth of challenges facing renters and the number of tenants
who are not living in dedicated rental accommodation.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
THAT Vancouver City Council direct staff to identify gaps in the City’s system of
targeting, tracking, resourcing and supporting Vancouver renters and renter issues and
report back to City Council with an implementation plan, timeline and budget for
establishing a department or centre within the City of Vancouver that addresses these
gaps, including:
i. Providing an official City of Vancouver point of contact for renter and tenancy
issues, including standards of maintenance, tenant relocation and protections,
and renovictions and demovictions;
ii. Oversight of drafting of permit conditions dealing with tenant protections to
provide tiers of enforcement options, including financial bonds, that can be
imposed throughout the development process;
iii. Proactively monitoring developers for compliance with tenant protection
conditions;
iv. Enforcing conditions and obligations that benefit tenants living in the City of
Vancouver that do not fall within the jurisdiction of the RTB, and impose penalties
where necessary;
v. Developing and reviewing policy and ensuring that tenants’ interests are taken
into account in the City’s work;
vi. Where appropriate, liaising with existing renter advocacy groups including but not
limited to City of Vancouver’s Renter’s Advisory Committee, the Tenant
Resource and Advisory Centre (TRAC) and the Vancouver Tenants Union (VTU);
vii. Coordinating with City permits, building inspections, and licensing (including
business and Short-Term Rentals) departments and data in order to protect
tenants from illegal renovictions and monitor rate of change to affordable rental
housing stock;

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, June 4, 2025 20
viii. Advise and work across City agencies and departments to ensure that the needs
of market and non-market renters including public, non-profit, and co-op housing
are being taken into account;
ix. Options for connecting existing staff whose work includes TRP compliance and
other tenant support, to identify ways to improve service delivery and efficiency to
increase the impact of this City work.

MOVED by Councillor Fry

WHEREAS
1. On June 3, 2025, Council received an urgent motion submitted on behalf of the
Mayor’s Office, titled “Memorial Event for the April 26th Lapu-Lapu Day Tragedy
in the City of Vancouver”;
2. The resolution authorized the City Manager or designate to enter into a no-fee

producing a ticketed “Come Together: Vancouver Strong” event at Rogers Arena,
supported by a $50,000 City budget allocation and nominal ticket fee to cover
unavoidable hard costs;

event would be community-led, for the community, by the community, and
centering community voices; and
4. Following Council’s unanimous approval of the resolution, some members of the

intentions, the process to arrive at the urgent motion inadvertently excluded
some necessary voices, and that the timing, tone, and format of such an event
should be aligned with victims and the communities affected.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
