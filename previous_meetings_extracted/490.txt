Robert LeBlanc, City Prosecutor, Legal Services, was present on behalf of the City of
Vancouver. Russell Frinskie, the Applicant, was present and accompanied by Isaac
Shieh, Associate, Lawson Lundell LLP, the Applicants’ Counsel.
Mr. LeBlanc provided opening remarks and reviewed relevant legislation as set out in section
275 of the Vancouver Charter and sections 4(4) and 25.1(3) of Licence By-law No. 4450. Mr.
LeBlanc advised the Panel that should they decide to issue or deny the 2022 business license
to the Applicant for a short-term rental, to state the reasons for the decision.
In support of the allegations set out in the evidence brief, Mr. LeBlanc called Koji Miyaji,
Assistant Director, Community Standards, Development, Buildings and Licencing, as a witness.
Mr. LeBlanc directed questions to Mr. Miyaji who, in response, explained the reasons why the
Applicant does not meet the qualifications as a Short Term Rental Accommodation Operator.
Mr. Shieh, on behalf of the Applicant, also directed questions to Mr. Miyaji.

The Business Licence Hearing Panel recessed at 7:35 pm and reconvened 7:40 pm.

Following the recess, Mr. LeBlanc sought permission to question Mr. Miyaji on an issue arising
under his examination by Mr. Shieh. Mr. LeBlanc further advised the Panel that the issue could
be clarified by the admission of a land title document for consideration as part of the evidence in
the proceeding. Mr. Shieh objected to the admission of the land title document on the basis of
late disclosure and procedural unfairness.

Subsequently, the Business Licence Hearing Panel recessed at 7:44 pm, to seek
advice from staff and reconvened at 7:51 pm.
