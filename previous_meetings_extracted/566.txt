CARRIED UNIMOUSLY
2. Updating the Requirement for Members of Council to Rise to Speak at Council
Meetings
Paul Mochrie, City Manager, responded to questions.
MOVED by Councillor Bligh
SECONDED by Councillor Dominato
WHEREAS
1. The City of Vancouver is governed by the Vancouver Charter, and established by
and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of
British Columbia;1
2. British Columbia’s system of government is based on the United Kingdom’s
Westminster tradition of parliamentary democracy – a government system with a
long history dating back over 800 years to the 13th century;
3. Many rules, customs, and traditions have accrued to the British Parliamentary
system over the centuries. For example, there is a longstanding practice whereby
Members of Parliament must “stand” while speaking, unless they are unable to
do so, and similarly they must “rise or half-rise” from their seats in order to catch
the Speaker’s attention;
4. Likewise, the Rules of the Senate of Canada (Chapter Six: Rules of Debate –
Recognition in Debate / Recognition by the Speaker) states: “Senators wishing to
speak shall rise at their assigned place and, when recognized by the Speaker,
shall address the Senators.”;

Council Meeting
Minutes, November 16 and December 14, 2021 38
5. Section 13 of the House of Commons Procedure and Practice (Rules of Order
and Decorum) under the sub-heading of “Manner of Speaking” states: “Any
Member who wishes to participate in the proceedings must stand and be in his or
her designated place to be recognized and to speak….” with exceptions such as
circumstance where a Member is unable to rise as a result of an injury or illness
etc.;
6. Part 6 of the City’s Procedure By-Law No. 12577 (Conduct of Council Members)
under the sub-heading “Rules of conduct” for speaking states: “6.2 When
questioning or speaking, a Council member must: (a) rise unless a disability
prevents the Council member from doing so. Council members are not required
to rise to speak at a standing committee meeting (section 5.7);
7. The City’s Procedure By-Law is not immutable and has seen many updates and
changes over time, including at the regular Vancouver City Council meeting on
October 5, 2021, where Council formally approved an amendment to the By-law
regarding electronic meeting and other amendments to allow for “electronic
special, regular and committee meetings of Council” (By-law No. 13129);
8. The hybrid meeting model adopted by Council during the COVID-19 pandemic,
and the expanded electronic meeting provisions of By-law No. 13129, has led to
an inadvertent situation whereby Council members who are present electronically
at a regular Council meeting are not required to stand, while those members
present in the Chamber are required to stand. Members of the public and those
on Council have made noted of observable inconsistency;
9. Likewise, the Persons with Disabilities Advisory Committee has stated that the
requirement to stand or rise at meetings is non-inclusive given that not everyone
is able to stand to speak at a Council meeting. The requirement to rise to speak
disadvantages those who are not able to stand;
10. By way of informal observation, most City Councils in Metro Vancouver do not
require their members to rise or stand while speaking. Likewise, Vancouver Park
Board Commissioners and Trustees of the Vancouver School Board do not stand
while speaking. Seeking recognition to speak in the municipal sphere is typically
achieved by an electronic means or by a simple gesture to speak; and
11. The City of Vancouver and Vancouver City Council are committed to enhancing
access and inclusion for all persons, including those with disabilities and those
from the wide diversity of communities within our city. It is important that all
persons are fully able to participate in City services and civic life on an equal
footing, an objective that is reflected in the City’s core values and commitments
to advance truth and reconciliation, equity, diversity, and anti-racism, as well as
to better understand and acknowledge the colonial legacies and functional
artefacts embedded within the City’s practices and traditions. Council and the
City strive at all times to improve and work towards a fairer, safer, more inclusive
city.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Vancouver City Council direct staff to prepare a
suitable amendment to the City’s Procedure By-Law No. 12577 to the effect that rising
to speak at regular Council meetings shall be optional and at the discretion and
preference of individual members of Council;

Council Meeting
Minutes, November 16 and December 14, 2021 39
FURTHER THAT staff be directed to report back by the end of Q1 of 2022 on the
specific history, circumstances, and reasons whereby members of Council have been –
and are currently – required to rise in order to speak at regular Council meetings, with
the intent being to document this information as a matter of civic historical and cultural
interest.

3. In the event of sudden cardiac arrest, bystander use of an automated external
defibrillator (AED), along with CPR, is crucial and increases the chance of
survival to 75% or higher;
4. In the event of an overdose, Naloxone can quickly reverse the effects of opioid
drugs and can reverse slowed breathing within 3 to 5 minutes allowing for life-
saving intervention;
5. St. John Ambulance is Canada’s leading first aid charity with a mission to
empower all Canadians to save lives by providing first aid training and supplies;
and
6. Through their “Start Me Up BC” campaign1, St. John Ambulance (BC/Yukon)
hopes to addresses a serious gap in our public emergency preparedness
platform, through a campaign to place 1000 low cost one-of-a-kind freestanding
community defibrillator stands across British Columbia. These Publicly
Accessible Defibrillators (PADs) are equipped with an AED, first aid and naloxone
kits, as well as a connected alarm system to dispatch emergency first
responders.

Council Meeting
Minutes, November 16 and December 14, 2021 40
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to report back on
opportunities to install automated Publicly Accessible Defibrillators (PADs) equipped with
naloxone and first aid kits, in locations throughout Vancouver, including:
a. In consultation with St. John’s Ambulance in consideration of their “Start Me Up”
campaign;
b. As part of a public benefit amenities on new developments;
c. At city facilities and/or appropriate public spaces; and/or
d. In partnerships at key locations for entertainment, transit, and public gathering.

SECONDED by Councillor De Genova
WHEREAS
1. BC’s Crisis Line Network, a group of community-based non-profit crisis centres
from across our province, 1 support lifesaving crisis de-escalation services,
suicide risk assessment, and collaborative safety planning through specifically
skilled and effective 24/7 crisis service responders: answering calls to 1-800-
SUICIDE, 310-6789 Mental Health, and regional distress lines; providing
employment opportunities and local crisis expertise in Vancouver, Surrey,
Richmond, Nanaimo, Prince George, Kamloops, Kelowna, Trail, Cranbrook, and
Williams Lake; and diverting calls from 911 and police-based mental health
response;
2. To meet rising demand for crisis intervention, the Province announced a well-
intentioned decision to increase funding and centralize call technology for BC’s
Crisis Line Network. As the result of this investment and in accordance with trade
law however, the Province will now be obliged to open all crisis line services to
competitive bid through a Request for Proposals (RFP). In the case of crisis calls,
this raises the possibility of bids going to large, multinational, for-profit
corporations and privatizing crisis services across the province, adding: privacy
concerns; service quality concerns; impacts on labour and education; and
potentially downloading service to local governments as at-risk callers are
referred to 911 in order to reduce costs and corporate liability;
3. For-profit telemedicine counselling services are a rapidly-growing industry sector.
2, 3 Notably, for-profit private corporations have professional teams to develop
proposals to win contracts. Typically, non-profit crisis centres do not have access
to the same resources to prepare competitive bids, and at a time when their core
services are in greater demand than ever;
4. Crisis Lines are highly integrated in regional health authority mental health
services, providing jobs for over 110 staff members and opportunities for over
550 volunteers. Over 450 students are trained each year as volunteer Crisis Line
Responders in BC, many of whom go on to become doctors, teachers, social
workers, and emergency and mental health professionals in our communities;
5. This year, across BC, Crisis Lines safely de-escalated 99.5% of their calls with
over 2.5 million minutes of life-saving support, saving BC taxpayers

Council Meeting
Minutes, November 16 and December 14, 2021 42
approximately $10.4 million and reducing stresses on police and hospital
services by diverting 7,099 interventions from 911; 16,251 interventions by in-
person Crisis Response Teams; and 50,901 emergency Mental Health Worker
engagements;
6. Vancouver City Council has consistently supported non-policing interventions for
mental health issues where possible:
a. The Vancouver Crisis Centre de-escalated 19,129 mental health crisis
and/or suicide-related calls (including VCH regional and 1800SUICIDE
and 310 Mental Health calls) in 2019/20;
b. According to Vancouver Police Department’s 2020 Our Community In
Need 4 report, 13,592 of 265,000 police calls for service were mental
health related. The report continues: "2,259 [Calls for Service] may or
may not have required police attendance, which is the equivalent of 6
CFS/ day (VPD officers attend, on average, 727 CFS a day). These 2,259
CFS resulted in officers dedicating approximately 11,800 hours, and this
equates to 8 officer positions (the cost of which is, $1,051,935). Of note,
there is no current program/community resource in existence that could
have attended in lieu of police"; and
7. BC’s Special Committee on Reforming the Police Act 5 acknowledges “the role of
police with respect to complex social issues including mental health and
wellness, addictions, and harm reduction; and in consideration of any appropriate
changes to relevant sections of the Mental Health Act.” The August 2020
Statement from the Special Committee further commits to follow-up with other
ministries and independent offices, and seek input from advocacy groups,
subject matter experts, and individuals with frontline experience in several related
areas including mental health.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT The Mayor on behalf of Council write to Minister of Health, Minister of
Mental Health and Addictions, Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General,
and the Minister of Advanced Education and Skills Training with a letter of
support for funded local Crisis Centres supporting community needs that:
a. Acknowledges role of crisis centres in health and well being of residents;
b. Describes the importance of community-based local services;
c. Highlights the role of crisis centres in diverting 911 calls and police
intervention;
d. Communicates concerns that privatized centralized crisis centres may
result in an increased burden on 911 calls and police, and should be
considered under the scope of the Special Committee on Reforming the
Police Act;
e. Distinguishes that local crisis centres provide important jobs and
volunteer opportunities in the community, including valuable training for
students in the medical, mental health, social work and protective
services fields; and
f. Encourages the province to pursue a funding and support model for BC
crisis centre services that does not prejudice the process towards an
open-bid RFP and recognizes the unique role and importance of BC’s

Council Meeting
Minutes, November 16 and December 14, 2021 43
Crisis Line Network.
B. THAT the following enactment along with preamble clauses 1 and 2 above is
submitted to the LMLGA for endorsement and consideration at the 2022 UBCM
Convention, and a copy of the entire resolution be submitted directly the UBCM
Health and Social Development Committee for immediate consideration.
Therefore be it resolved that the UBCM urge the Province to pursue a
funding and support model for crisis centre services that that does not
prejudice the process towards an open-bid RFP and recognizes the
unique role and importance of BC’s Crisis Line Network, providing local
community-based services for vulnerable British Columbians, diverting
911 calls and police intervention, and encourages local employment,
training, and volunteer opportunities in communities across BC.

MOVED by Mayor Stewart
SECONDED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
WHEREAS
1. The C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group (“C40”) is a network of 97 cities around
the world that represents one twelfth of the world's population and one quarter of the
global economy;
2. C40 is a network collaborating to deliver the urgent action needed right now to

outlines bold steps to deliver an equitable and sustainable recovery from the
COVID-19 pandemic;
4. Vancouver has been a member of the C40 network of Cities since 2012 and has

6. Budget Transparency and Accountability in Municipal Election Years
MOVED by Councillor Dominato
SECONDED by Councillor De Genova
WHEREAS
1. The City of Vancouver is required by the Vancouver Charter, Library Act, and
Police Act to produce a consolidated operating budget incorporating the separate
internal budgets of the Board of Parks and Recreation, the Vancouver Public
Library Board, and the Vancouver Police Board, and is required by Public Sector
Accounting Standards to include the Vancouver Downtown Parking Corporation
(aka EasyPark) in its consolidated financial statements;
2. The City of Vancouver has a policy (Policy Number ADMIN-004: “Budgets –
Operating”) which outlines the requirements for Operating Revenues and

Council Meeting
Minutes, November 16 and December 14, 2021 45
Expenditures, including authorization requirements. The policy applies to all
Operating Revenues and Operating Expenditures undertaken by the City of
Vancouver and is intended to supplement and provide operational clarity and
promote best practices within the statutory requirements relating to budgeting as
set out in the Vancouver Charter, Police Act, and Library Act;
3. Section 219 (1) of the Vancouver Charter (“Director of Finance to report on
revenue and expenditure”) states: “As soon as practicable in each year and in
any event by April 30, the Director of Finance must prepare and submit to the
Council a report setting out the Director of Finance’s estimates in detail of the
anticipated revenues and expenditures of the city for that year.”;
4. With respect to the requirement for the City to set an Operating Budget, Policy
Number ADMIN-004 (“Budgets – Operating”) states, under section 2 (1.1), that
“The Director of Finance is to present an Annual Operating Budget for the
upcoming year as a report to Council in December of each year.” The policy
further states that “On an exception basis, as determined by the Director of
Finance, such as may occur in the year of a municipal election, an internal
working budget will be developed by December of that year, and a budget
will be adopted by Council no later than April 30th of the following year as
required by section 219 of the Vancouver Charter.”;
5. Additionally, Policy Number ADMIN-004 (“Budgets – Operating”) states, under
section 2 (1.2), that “In any year in which the budget is not approved by Council
before December 31st, Council may authorize expenditures as are necessary to
carry on the business of the City until the budget is adopted, if the following
conditions are met:
(a) the amounts for that Budget Line Item does not exceed the amount for
the Budget Line Item in the prior Annual Operating Budget, and
(b) the expenditure is approved by at least two-thirds of City Council.”;
6. There are clearly no statutory requirements relating to budgets, as set out in the
Vancouver Charter, Police Act, or Library Act, that would necessitate the
approval of a City of Vancouver Operating Budget in December of any year,
including a municipal election year. An “internal working budget” can be
developed by December of a municipal election year – or “In any year in which
the budget is not approved by Council before December 31st” – and a final
budget adopted by Council no later than April 30th of the following year, with
Council empowered to authorize expenditures necessary to carry on the
business of the City until the budget is adopted if the amounts for that Budget
Line Item does not exceed the amount for the Budget Line Item in the prior year’s
Operating Budget and the expenditure is approved by at least two-thirds of City
Council;
7. As a point of relevant comparison to the City of Vancouver’s budget policy, the
section of the City of Toronto Act (CoTA) 2006 that pertains to Toronto’s “Yearly
Budget” (i.e., section 228) includes an exception clause, namely subsection 228
(2), which states that “Despite subsection (1), a budget for a year immediately
following a year in which a regular election is held may only be adopted in the
year to which the budget applies.” 1 and

Council Meeting
Minutes, November 16 and December 14, 2021 46
8. Anecdotally, in municipal election years, other Metro Vancouver municipalities
approve their budgets in the year to which the budget applies, allowing the
incoming Council adequate and reasonable time to review the draft budget.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Policy Number ADMIN-004 (“Budgets –
Operating”) Section 2 (POLICY STATEMENTS) be amended to empower Council in its
governance and stewardship responsibilities, and to better reflect the budget
circumstances of a municipal election year where there is a new incoming Council by
striking subsection 1.1. under the heading “Requirement to set a budget” and replacing it
with the following amended wording:
• Section 1.1. “The Director of Finance is to present an Annual Operating
Budget for the upcoming year as a report to Council in December of each
year. In the year of a municipal election, an internal working budget will
be developed by December of that year, and a budget will be adopted by
Council in the year that it applies and no later than April 30th of that
year as required by section 219 of the Vancouver Charter.”

1 Subsection 228 (1) of the City of Toronto Act (CoTA) 2006 states that “For each year, the City

7. Working Collaboratively to Become a Restorative City
MOVED by Councillor Wiebe
SECONDED by Councillor Carr
WHEREAS
1. Vancouver is struggling to address the impacts of multiple crises. Many residents
feel unsafe and isolated, and are experiencing harm. The current justice system
alone is not able to deal with the complexities of the issues and meet people’s
needs. Systemic change is required, with calls for increased use of restorative
approaches;
2. Restorative justice is a different way to understand and achieve justice. It focuses
on addressing harm, healing and relationships. It’s a relational, inclusive, flexible
and participatory approach that can be complementary or an alternative to the

Council Meeting
Minutes, November 16 and December 14, 2021 47
legal system. It’s guided by values, principles and Indigenous teachings. Affected
parties – those who caused harm, those harmed, their families and community –
are given an opportunity to participate in determining meaningful accountability,
reparation, meeting needs and a path forward;
3. Restorative justice has been proven to be effective in addressing harm, reducing
recidivism, and increasing public safety. For example, Restorative Justice
Victoria is a city-wide program with data from over a decade and almost 1700
cases. They accept diverse and serious cases - robbery, assault, fatalities and
much more. Of all cases accepted into their restorative justice program, 95%
completed successfully. In all cases within the last 4 years, 96% of victims and
99% of offenders were satisfied. 100% of victims would recommend restorative
justice to others;
4. There are about 80 restorative justice programs across BC. Surrounding
municipalities support restorative justice programs, including North & West
Vancouver, Richmond, Surrey, Tri-Cities, Langley and Abbotsford;
5. In Vancouver, there is a huge gap in community-based restorative justice
programs and very limited justice options outside of criminal justice and courts.
An Indigenous program, Vancouver Aboriginal Transformative Justice Services
Society, offers services for Indigenous peoples. MCFD Youth Justice now has
two probation officers who offer restorative justice post-sentencing for youth.
Restorative approaches are available through fee-for-services offered
independently. Criminal justice options expanded to include the Downtown
Community Court and Drug Treatment Court; they have also expressed interest
in having more restorative justice;
6. A global restorative movement continues to grow. The United Nations endorses
and promotes it. In recent years, leadership has emerged from cities like Hull
(UK), Oakland (USA), and Whanganui (New Zealand) who have expanded the
focus from restorative justice programs to committing to becoming Restorative
Cities;
7. A Restorative City is a city that expands beyond criminal justice to implement
restorative values, principles and practices across multiple sectors. The basic
goals of a Restorative City include healthy people, safe streets, strong
communities, and a connected city that is invested in the humanity of all its
citizens. As Whanganui (NZ) said, it’s creating an environment for all “to thrive
and succeed together through respectful relationships”;
8. The potential benefits and outcomes of a Restorative City are vast. It could
change the trajectories away from ongoing impacts of colonization, polarization,
fragmented services, addiction, poverty, violence, incarceration, death and
environmental destruction; and result in a city deeply rooted in communities that
care for one another;
9. The foundation of becoming a Restorative City has already started in Vancouver
by a diverse collective. Peace of the Circle received initial funding through Civil

Council Meeting
Minutes, November 16 and December 14, 2021 48
Forfeiture Funds, Ministry of Public Safety and Solicitor General BC to launch
‘Building Partnerships for Restorative Justice in Vancouver’. At their latest
stakeholders meeting in October 2021, they reached a consensus to work toward
becoming a Restorative City. Through the coordination of Peace of the Circle,
this collective is collaborating across sectors to create a relational, holistic,
interdisciplinary, decolonizing approach to harm reduction, healing, safety, justice
and peace (see background information for list of participants);
10. Becoming a Restorative City aligns with many current initiatives and strategies of
the City, including: the Healthy City Strategy; the July 2020 motion council
passed: “Decriminalizing Poverty and Supporting Community-led Safety
Initiatives”; Safe Spaces for Women and Girls; Reconciliation and Equity; Anti-
Racism; Murdered and Missing Indigenous Women and Girls; and
11. The Vancouver restorative collective is able to oversee the development and do
the work necessary to move Vancouver towards becoming a Restorative City.
This requires deepening partnerships, support and funding. Achieving justice and
safety lies in the hands of communities, organizations, governments at all levels
and ultimately, all of us.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council endorse the aspiration of Vancouver becoming a Restorative City.
B. THAT Council direct staff to create training opportunities for staff to learn about
restorative justice and that they include opportunities to incorporate restorative
justice values, principles, and programing in future reports back to Council when
applicable.
C. THAT Council commits to having a representative participate in meetings of the
Vancouver restorative collective as a stakeholder;
FURTHER THAT Council direct staff to include an option for $200,000 to support
a restorative justice lens for consideration by Council for the 2022 Budget
process, specific allocation to be for a $150,000 one-time grant to the Restorative
Collective to work on the development of a Restorative City Framework and
$50,000 to support development and delivery of restorative justice training for
City staff and Council.

United Nations:
Has long endorsed restorative justice.
“Restorative justice is an inclusive, flexible and participatory approach to crime that can be
complementary or an alternative to the conventional criminal justice process. It provides an
opportunity to all affected parties – offenders, victims, their families and the community – to
participate in addressing the crime and repairing the harm caused by it. It is also often the only,
or one of very few, measures available for victims to participate in the resolution of a case and
seek redress. Underpinning restorative justice is the understanding that criminal behaviour not
only breaches the law, but also harms victims and the community.
In recent decades, the use of restorative justice in criminal matters has significantly increased
around the world. As the custodian of the Basic Principles on the Use of Restorative Justice
Programmes in Criminal Matters, UNODC assists Member States…”:

The 14th UN Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice was held March 7-12, 2021 in
Kyoto, Japan. This largest international meeting in the fields of crime prevention and criminal
justice is organised every five years. The Kyoto Declaration:
● Explicitly calls for the facilitation of “restorative justice processes at relevant stages in
criminal proceedings in order to assist the recovery of victims and the reintegration of
offenders” (article 42).
● Highlights the significance of victim-centred procedures and the key role of
practitioners' professional training “to strengthen their capacity to provide victim-centred
assistance and support that take into account the specific needs of victims” (article 34).

ENQUIRIES AND OTHER MATTERS
1. Follow-up on Motion “Public Safety: Evaluating and Addressing Any Impacts of
City of Vancouver Actions on Neighbourhood Safety”
Councillor De Genova requested an update from staff regarding work related to the motion
approved at the Special Council meeting of October 5, 6, and 7, 2021, entitled “Public Safety:
Evaluating and Addressing Any Impacts of City of Vancouver Actions on Neighbourhood
Safety”. The City Manager noted staff met on December 6, 2021, with the BIAs and the
Vancouver Police Department, and will be preparing a memo for distribution to Council that will
be publicly available by the end of the year.
2. Cleanliness Concerns at Overdose Prevention Site on Seymour Street
Councillor De Genova noted concerns on the cleanliness of Seymour Street near the Overdose
Prevention site, as the street was kept very clean during the filming of a movie but the upkeep of
the cleanliness of the street ended once the filming concluded. Councillor De Genova enquired
who is responsible for the street’s cleanliness in general, as well as during movie productions,
and enquired on whether access to the Overdose Prevention site was affected during the filming
of the movie. The City Manager noted the lessees are responsible for the cleanliness and
upkeep of the immediate frontage, and agreed to provide Council with a response regarding
who is responsible for keeping the street clean during filming.
3. Concerns with TransLink Service Reductions
Councillor Swanson raised concerns regarding numerous TransLink bus routes experiencing
cuts to frequency and/or cancellations around the city and enquired how Council could advocate
for transit riding citizens and the climate. The City Manager noted that due to the pandemic
TransLink is facing a historic funding shortfall; however, staff is in contact with TransLink and
can liaise Council’s concerns and request a response from TransLink of what is being done to
advocate for senior government funding.
4. Future Planning of Skeena Terrace
Councillor Wiebe enquired with staff on whether the future planning of Skeena Terrace can
have a similar model to False Creek. The City Manager will follow up with staff and provide a
response.
5. Provincial School Tax Relief for Businesses
Councillor Wiebe noted that in 2020 the Province provided a school tax waiver for the business
sector dealing with impacts from the pandemic. Councillor Wiebe enquired whether the City has
created a communications plan on this issue, and whether there have been any conversations
with the Province regarding additional help for businesses that are still recovering in 2021. The
City Manager noted staff had been in discussion with the Province earlier in the year and it was
made clear that the 2020 school tax waiver was a one time occurrence. The City Manager noted
staff were not aware of any Provincial plans for property tax relief for businesses and would not
be speaking to businesses about Provincial taxes as that would strictly fall on the Province.
