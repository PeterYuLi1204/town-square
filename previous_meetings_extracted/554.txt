At 11 am, during discussion on Councillor Boyle’s amendment to the amendment, Councillor

amendment to the amendment in order as the previously passed decision asked staff to bring
forth options for scenarios of up to 5% budget increases, and the final decision would still
remain with Council to decide during the 2022 Budget discussion.
At 11:09 am, during discussion on Councillor Boyle’s amendment to the amendment, Councillor
Kirby-Yung rose on a point of order under Section 8.7(f) of the Procedure By-law, noting this
amendment to the amendment is inconsistent with financial practice and conflicts with previous
advice received from staff on how one time and ongoing funds can be used. After consulting
with staff, Mayor Stewart ruled the amendment to the amendment in order as the $1.61M
shortfall will need to be off-set with an increase in the property tax, which Council will be
deciding on later in the discussion.

carried
At 11:53 am, during discussion on Mayor Stewart’s amendment to the amendment, Councillor
Kirby-Yung rose on a point of order under Section 8.7(b) of the Procedure By-law, noting this
amendment to the amendment is proposing to direct the work to the Auditor General, which per
the Auditor General By-law, Council is not allowed to do so, in order to maintain the Auditor
General’s independence. Duty Mayor Fry ruled the amendment to the amendment in order as
under Section 3.5 of the Auditor General By-law, it allows for groups to make a request to the
Auditor General for a review, which is what this amendment to the amendment is asking for.

De Genova rose on a point of order under Sections 8.7(a) and 8.7(b) of the Procedure By-law,

government of the City, and also conflicts with Section 3.4 of the Auditor General By-law.

During the ruling on the point of order above, Council recessed at 11:59 am and

Following the recess, Duty Mayor Fry ruled the amendment to the amendment in order as it
complies with both Sections 3.4 and 3.5 of the Auditor General By-law, as a board is able to
make a request to the Auditor General for a review and it is the Auditor General’s decision
whether or not to undertake that request.
At 1:15 pm, Duty Mayor Fry reminded Councillors to not impugn the motives of other Councillors
as under Section 6.1(c) under the Procedure By-law.
Prior to the vote, Council agreed to separate the components of the amendment to the
