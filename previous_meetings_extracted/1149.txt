Public Hearing
Minutes, Tuesday, June 13, 2017 68
(b) That, prior to approval by Council of the form of development, the
applicant shall obtain approval of a development application by the
Director of Planning, who shall have particular regard to the following:
Urban Design
1. Design development to improve the privacy of unit courtyards as
follows:
(i) provide a substantial landscape buffer between the
pathway west property line;
(ii) ensure that landscape species for the above will afford
privacy to neighbouring sites; and
(iii) provide confirmation that timed exterior lights or similar
will be used for these western facing units.
Note to Applicant: The foregoing are measures to mitigate
impacts and improve privacy to the western neighbour.
2. Design development to improve the privacy and overlook of the
proposal by:
(i) Reduce the family room window of Unit 1 from 14’-0” to
10’-0” in width;
(ii) Reduce the size and/or number of windows at the upper
levels (bedrooms) to the extent possible; and
(iii) Employ, if possible, translucent glazing.
Note to Applicant: In the case of bedroom windows, in two
instances, window widths should be reduced to 2’-6” in width.
The above conditions are to improve the privacy and overlook of
the proposal to the neighbouring site(s).
3. Design development to ensure and maintain the use of high
quality, durable materials.
Note to Applicant: All habitable rooms, including bedrooms
should have direct access to a window for provision of light,
views and ventilation. Primary living spaces, such as living
rooms, of north-facing units on the 2nd and 3rd floors must have
a direct outlook to the street or lane. Provision of light and
views must be achieved without negative impact on privacy of
neighbouring developments.
4. Design consideration to reduce the size of the master bedroom
deck, attic level, Unit 5.

Public Hearing
Minutes, Tuesday, June 13, 2017 69
Note to Applicant: The above area is not well integrated with
the roof design and massing of this structure.
Crime Prevention Through Environmental (CPTED)
5. Design development to consider the principles of CPTED, having
particular regard for security in the in between spaces towards
the lane.
Landscape Design
6. Design development to grades, retaining walls, walkways and
structural design, to ensure neighbouring grades are met and
outside private spaces are respected. This should be confirmed
by the provision of minimum three east-west sections, from
building face to west neighbouring property. The sections should
be of sufficient scale to detail fences, walls, walkway, stairs and
other landscape elements.
7. Design development to provide a higher quality landscape plan,
of similar character to neighbourhood context, to provide a
friendly orientation to both streets. This should consist of
additional front yard trees, substantial, layered planting beds
and open visually accessible front yards.
8. Design development to location of utilities.
Note to Applicant: Avoid the awkward placement of utilities (pad
mounted transformers, “Vista” junctions, underground venting)
visible to the public realm. Where utilities must be located near
a street or sidewalk, a secondary circulation route is the
preferred location. Every effort should be made to integrate
utility access into structures and behind lockable, decorative
gates or screened with landscaping. No trenching for utility
hook-ups shall take place inside tree protection zones.
9. Provision of further arboricultural information, to discuss in
detail methods of safe protection for retained trees, in context
of proposed revised footprint, grades and other site constraints.
Report to include a scaled and dimensioned tree protection plan

construction methods should be detailed, such alternate
methods of tree protection, exploratory digging to determine
actual extent of Critical Root Zones, possibility of hydro-vac or
other arboricultural measures.
10. Provision of improved sustainability by the provision of edible
plants.

Public Hearing
Minutes, Tuesday, June 13, 2017 70
Note to Applicant: Edible plants can be used as ornamentals as
part of the landscape design.
11. Design development to locate, integrate and fully screen lane
edge gas meters and parking garage vents in a manner which
minimizes their impact on the architectural expression and the
project’s open space and public realm.
12. Consideration to explore design options that respect the City of
Vancouver Bird Friendly Design Guidelines.
Note to Applicant: Refer to relevant documents -
http://council.vancouver.ca/20150120/documents/rr1attachme
ntB.pdf and
http://council.vancouver.ca/20150120/documents/rr1attachme
ntC.pdf
13. Provision requirements at the time of Development Permit
application:

submitted. The Landscape Plan should illustrate proposed
plant materials (with common and botanical names, plant
sizes and quantities), paving, walls, railings, light
fixtures, site grading and other landscape features. Plant
material should be listed in a Plant List that is clearly
keyed to the Landscape Plan. The Landscape Plan should
be a minimum 1:100 or 1/8” scale.
(ii) Section details at a minimum scale of 1/4”=1’-0” scale to
illustrate typical proposed landscape elements including
benches, fences, gates, arbours and trellises, and other
