UNFINISHED BUSINESS
1. Standardized Apartment Districts and City-Initiated Zoning Changes to Implement
Broadway Plan and Cambie Corridor Plan
June 30, 2025
At the Public Hearing on September 16, 2025, Council heard the staff presentation, asked
questions of the staff and applicant, heard from public speakers and closed the speakers list
and receipt of public comments for this item. Council subsequently referred closing comments,
questions to staff, debate and decision to the Council meeting on October 7, 2025, as
Unfinished Business.
Council had before it a yellow memorandum dated September 2, 2025, entitled "Standardized
Apartment Districts and City-Initiated Zoning Changes to Implement Broadway Plan and
Cambie Corridor Plan – Amendment to Council Report”, which noted corrections to Appendix A
and Appendix I of the Referral Report dated June 30, 2025, entitled “Standardized Apartment
Districts and City-Initiated Zoning Changes to Implement Broadway Plan and Cambie Corridor
Plan”. The above-noted memorandum also noted a typographical error in the above-noted
report which incorrectly refers to Appendix “M” instead of Appendix “J’ on page 16 of the same
report.
Council also had before it a second yellow memorandum dated September 12, 2025, entitled
"Standardized Apartment Districts and City-Initiated Zoning Changes to Implement Broadway
Plan and Cambie Corridor Plan – Amendments to Council Report and Draft Zoning and
Development By-law”, which determined a correction was required to remove three sites,
comprised of seven parcels, from the City-initiated rezoning. The yellow memorandum directed
that the three CD-1 By-laws for the sites be excluded from the City-initiated rezoning, which
