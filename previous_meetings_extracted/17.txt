2. Baby change tables, once vandalized, are no longer safe to use,
consistent with the principle that baby car seats and bike helmets that
have been in an accident are safety-compromised, and cannot be relied
upon to protect a child while in use; and
3. Addressing the identified issue of vandalism to baby change tables in the
city is not about cost-cutting but rather it is about preventing harm to
children.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to prioritize the
prompt replacement of vandalized baby-change tables in areas where there are
high levels of family use in the 30 locations experiencing repeated vandalism,
and continue to search for:
(a) more resilient materials and designs that are harder to damage and
easier to maintain;
(b) alternative installation locations within facilities to reduce exposure to
vandalism; and
(c) design improvements for future installations, such as tamper-resistant
fixtures and improved sightlines.

increase for an average detached single family home in Vancouver;

own is under $3 million and their primary residence is a home they own in

to homeowners on how to apply with their 2026 tax notice;
