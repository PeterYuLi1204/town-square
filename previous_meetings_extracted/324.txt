CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY
(Councillor Boyle absent for the vote)
A3. Addressing the Hotel Supply Gap to Support Tourism Economy and Reduce
Pressure on Local Housing
MOVED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
SECONDED by Councillor Klassen
WHEREAS
1. The lack of hotel capacity in Vancouver could cost the city billions in lost
economic impact and thousands of unrealized full-time jobs. The latest
Destination Vancouver modelling shows demand is poised to exceed supply as
early as 2026;
2. In March 2023, Destination Vancouver identified that in order to close the gap
between current supply and projected demand, 20,000 new hotel rooms are
needed in Metro Vancouver by 2050; with 10,000 of those new hotel rooms
necessary in Vancouver, according to the newest study Economic Analysis of
Hotel Supply and Projected Demand in Metro Vancouver;
3. Without new rooms, the lack of hotel supply in Metro Vancouver will translate into
significant losses to the provincial economy. Between 2022 and 2050, the
cumulative economic impacts are projected to be:
• $30.6 billion in foregone output;
• $16.6 billion in forgone GDP;
• 168,000+ FTEs of foregone employment; and
• $7.5 billion in foregone tax revenue for all three levels of government;
4. Vancouver’s continued loss of hotel rooms was identified by the tourism sector
prior to the pandemic and is due to development policies that provided
geographic and zoning restrictions. The high cost of land is also resulting in
alternate use of sites including conversion to residential housing, and the high
costs of operating properties are also a barrier. Lengthy approval processes,

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, September 13, 2023 12
view cone restrictions and stringent shadow protections have created additional
challenges. With the advent of Covid-19, hotel inventory was further reduced
through initiatives such as the Federal Government’s Rapid Housing Initiative
that resulted in the sale and acquisition of a number of properties for conversion
to shelter and supportive housing;
5. The only new hotels that have been built and completed since, have been mixed-
use hotel and market strata condo in areas where commercial uses (hotel is
classified as ‘service uses’ under commercial) were mandatory while residential
uses were allowed. Conversely, where commercial uses are not mandatory and
residential uses are allowed, there is no reason for a proponent to consider hotel
use since hotel will have a negative impact on overall financial performance due
to a commitment to long-term high operating costs.
In commercial uses only areas, it’s uncommon to see a mixed-use hotel and
office development due to differing floor plate requirements; office usually
requires larger floor plates (12,000 square feet or more) whereas hotel usually
requires smaller floor plates (approx. 7,500 to 9,000 square feet akin to
residential sizing);
6. The future for our tourism industry looks bright if we can close the gap on new
rooms. Over the next few years Vancouver will host tennis’s Laver Cup, the
Invictus Games, Grey Cup, and in 2026 the world’s largest single sport event, the
FIFA World Cup, and several significant and economy boosting business
conventions and conferences;
7. Cities of a comparable profile have been building new hotels at a steady pace. At
the same time, Vancouver’s hotel supply has been contracting; Vancouver has
lost 1,500 rooms since 2010. The pandemic removed an additional 550 rooms
from the city’s inventory, with purchases by BC Housing and City of Vancouver
that converted those rooms to supportive housing;
8. According to Destination Vancouver data, the city has the majority (57%) of the
23,000 hotel rooms in Metro Vancouver but trends show this to be on the decline.
A further 1,674 hotel rooms are at risk in the short and medium term for
redevelopment. Continued loss of hotel accommodation will constrain job growth
in the tourism industry and put further pressure on the use of residential homes
for short-term rentals;
9. Over the past few years, legal and illegal short-term rental (STR) of residences in
the downtown and adjacent neighbourhoods have met some of the increased
demand for tourist accommodation, but the shortage of hotel rooms can put
pressure on local housing stock. While City staff acknowledge the benefit STRs
provide to the tourism industry, in the face of an affordability crisis and record low
rental vacancy rates, the City has naturally prioritized housing for people who
want to live and work in Vancouver;
10. In 2017, Council introduced new regulations on short-term rentals to minimize the
loss of rental housing to STR use by limiting STRs to those associated with
principal residences. By increasing the supply of hotel rooms, it is hoped this will

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, September 13, 2023 13
not only help to expand and support the tourism economy, but will also reduce
STR use of residential apartments by visitors;
11. The Interim Hotel Development Policy approved by Council at Public Hearing on
July 31, 2018, was put in place to flag issues related to loss of hotel rooms in the
city. The Interim Hotel Development Policy does not provide incentives for the
development of hotels, nor is it an enabling policy for rezoning. The policy aimed
to:
a. Reaffirm the importance of hotels and related meeting facilities to
Vancouver’s economy, especially in the downtown and emerging office
areas;
b. Be used in the evaluation of enquiries and applications for the development
of new hotels, the expansion of hotels and the demolition of existing hotels;
c. Moderate the loss of hotel rooms and encourage new hotels while limiting
impacts to existing housing. This includes the introduction of a hotel
conversion policy to minimize the loss of rental housing stock and of hotel
rooms;
d. Inform community planning such as the Broadway Plan and other City-wide
planning initiatives;
e. Aim to produce no net loss in the city's hotel room stock until new targets are
brought forward to Council for consideration;
f. Retain hotel uses in the downtown by including hotel as a conditional use in
the Downtown Official Development Plan (DODP) Areas 'L1' and 'N';
12. The visitor economy plays a critical role in supporting the city and region’s
economy. In 2019, the direct spending impact to Vancouver was approximately
$8.5B supporting over 57,000 full-time jobs. In addition to:
• Delivering more to the Provincial GDP ($4B) than almost any other
primary resource industry;
• Wages and salaries of $2.8B;
• Provincial, Regional and Municipal Tax Revenue of $1.5B; and
• On an average day, a visitor to Vancouver spends more than double what
a resident does in local shops, restaurants and on local services;
13. Work to better understand options for increasing hotel supply has been emerging
but not a key priority: the Phase 2 Report of the Employment Lands and
Economy Review, approved by Council in Oct. 2020, included the following
direction for hotels: “Consider increasing capacity in mixed use and job only
areas to meet needs over the long term, including land use tools to support new
hotels.”;

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, September 13, 2023 14
14. The City can play an important role in further enabling and prioritizing the delivery
of new hotels to address the critical shortage of rooms to encourage new
development;
15. Existing development applications and permits for additional hotel capacity
submitted to the City of Vancouver are insufficient to replace the losses. The total
estimate of approximately 1,100 new rooms in rezoning, planning, or permitting
stages through to 2026 is not guaranteed; and
16. Lack of available hotel rooms will make visiting Vancouver even more expensive,
and the city will be less competitive in attracting major conferences, large
sporting events and leisure group travel, resulting in lost business and overall
diminished global competitiveness. Vancouver is running short on time to
prepare for the influx of visitors and the economic impact they contribute to the
city. Those visitors will just go elsewhere.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to consider and report back by the end of Q1 2024 on
opportunities to build upon The Interim Hotel Development Policy to expand and
encourage new hotels and hotel room supply, including but not limited to
geographic expansion of this policy, building upon Council direction for hotel use
in the Granville Entertainment District and Broadway Plan, mixed tenure
developments that might include hotel and residential use, hotel and office use,
or conversion of office to hotel, potential to amend the 2009 Rezoning Policy for
the CBD and CBD Shoulder Areas to allow consideration of mixed-use hotel and
residential development recognizing that hotel can meet the commercial density
requirements to ensure no net loss of job space, innovative hotel types, as well
as other development policies and tools that would enable new units in the City
to support the continued viability of Vancouver’s visitor economy.
B. THAT Council direct staff to bring back options to set targets for new hotel
delivery and tracking of new rooms coming online, similar to the City setting
targets for Housing Vancouver, in order to track progress towards addressing the
shortage of 10,000 new rooms.
C. THAT Council direct staff to identify and report back on all current hotel or mixed
use hotel proposals at the LOE, rezoning or permitting stages, to highlight
challenges and identify potential solutions in order to expedite the delivery of new
hotels.
D. THAT Council direct staff to engage with key relevant stakeholders including but
not limited to Destination Vancouver, the Vancouver Convention and Exhibition
Centre, the Vancouver Hotel Association, the Vancouver Hotel Destination
Association, the British Columbia Hotel Association and the development sector
for input on current challenges and potential policy solutions to better enable
development of new hotels;

Force, including the participation of the above-referenced stakeholders.
