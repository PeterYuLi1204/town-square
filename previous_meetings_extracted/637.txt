8. Accessible Washrooms and Elevators on Millennium Broadway Line Extension
(Member’s Motion B.5)
At the Council meeting on May 18, 2021, Council referred this motion to the Standing
Committee on Policy and Strategic Priorities meeting on May 19, 2021, in order to hear from
speakers, followed by debate and decision.
The Committee heard from four speakers in support of the motion.

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, May 19, 25, 26 and 27, 2021 4
MOVED by Councillor Wiebe
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. The Persons with Disabilities Advisory Committee (PDAC) has communicated
the need for TransLink to include, on opening day of the Millennium Broadway
Line Extension, universally accessible gender-neutral public washrooms and
paired elevators within all stations of the Millennium Line Broadway Extension, as
outlined in the motions passed by PDAC on September 7, 2017, and
January 23, 2020;
2. It is PDAC’s understanding that many of the stations will have washrooms that
can only be accessed upon request by the transit user to SkyTrain staff, and
therefore the washrooms are not publicly available. This is an affront to the
dignity of persons with disabilities and others, particularly those who need to
access a toilet on a frequent and urgent basis due to health challenges and
misses the opportunity to fulfill accessible goals put forward in TransLink’s
Access Transit Strategy, the current development of the Provincial Accessibility
Act by the BC government and the City of Vancouver’s commitment to the
development of an Accessible City Strategy;
3. Only Broadway-City Hall and Arbutus Stations has space allotted for universally
accessible washrooms and allow for future elevators to be added at the
Oak-VGH station and the Arbutus station with only the Broadway-City Hall station
would have paired elevators; and
4. On December 10, 2020, the Persons with Disabilities Advisory Committee
approved the following motion: THAT the Persons with Disabilities Advisory
Committee write a letter to Mayor Kennedy Stewart, identifying, as a priority,
starting on opening day of the Millennium Broadway Line Extension, the inclusion
of universally accessible public gender-neutral washrooms and paired sets of
elevators within all six stations of the Millennium Broadway Extension.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council requests the Mayor to address with
TransLink, through the Mayor’s Council, serious accessibility concerns in the
construction of the planned Millennium Line Broadway Extension, specifically the
inclusion of universally accessible, public gender-neutral washrooms and paired
elevators at each station.
amended
AMENDMENT MOVED by Councillor De Genova
THAT the following be added at the end:
FURTHER THAT Council request the Mayor write a letter on behalf of Vancouver
City Council, to the BC Minister of Environment and Climate Change notifying
them of this motion and emphasizing the importance of providing universally
accessible public washrooms to further encourage and increase active
transportation and public transportation province-wide.

MOVED by Councillor Boyle
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. An increasing number of residents in Vancouver are struggling to find stable,
secure housing at a rate that is affordable for local incomes. Renters, including
seniors, people with disabilities, single parent (often female-led) households,
youth, and Indigenous communities are particularly squeezed by this housing

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, May 19, 25, 26 and 27, 2021 9
crisis, and are in even greater need of being able to access secure, affordable
housing;
2. In addition, the need for accessible and adaptable rental housing for seniors and
people with disabilities, at prices that are affordable to middle and low-income
residents, is significant and will increase even further over the next two decades;
3. Vancouver’s housing market has seen significant increases in land values and
housing costs, pricing a growing number of residents out of the housing market.
The escalation of home prices has also led to significant displacement,
particularly of renters, and low and middle-income residents;
4. Complete, walkable communities rely on essential workers such as health care
workers and grocery store clerks, who should have the opportunity to work near
their jobs, rather than having to commute long distances to get to their jobs.
Research suggests that mixed-income communities have better outcomes for all
residents (not just low-income residents) because of a greater access to
services;
5. The Housing Vancouver Strategy (2018-2027) includes a target of 12,000 new
social, supportive and coop homes by 2027. As of Q4 2020, the City has
approved new development applications to meet 47% of this target. The City is
also committed to partnering with urban Indigenous organizations to deliver
culturally appropriate housing developments. The high number of households in
Vancouver paying over 30% of their income in rent indicates that more non-profit,
co-op, and social housing is needed;
6. The City’s definition of social housing in the Zoning and Development By-law
requires the housing be owned and operated on a not-for-profit basis by
non-profit housing societies, co-op, or government agencies. And that at a
minimum 30% of the units are occupied by households with incomes below
Housing Income Limits set out by the Province. Many new developments rely on
mixed-income housing models, with a mix of affordability levels to cover costs,
typically with affordability deepening over time or deepening through access to
senior government funding;
7. The Community Housing sector, made up of non-profit and co-op housing
providers, is an important partner in the provision of affordable non-market
housing across Vancouver, and the sector’s capacity in Vancouver has grown
significantly over recent years;
8. Housing created in partnership with the community housing sector is “speculation
free” housing because of the requirement through the CRA to maximize
affordability, and because of the ability to place covenants on non-profit buildings
that prevent sale for profit;
9. City staff analysis has demonstrated that half of recent social housing
developments have required rezoning through a public hearing process,
compared to less than a third of market condominium development. Single
detached homes do not require a public hearing, even when a new detached
home is significantly larger and more expensive than the one it is replacing. The

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, May 19, 25, 26 and 27, 2021 10
added time and cost of requiring a public hearing impacts what type of housing
gets built, and it is currently not aligned with what type of housing is most
needed;
10. Rezoning for a non-profit typically takes a year or longer, and can add
approximately $400,000-$800,000 onto the cost of a project, as well as requiring
significant municipal staff time. This results in rents that are higher at occupancy
and/or means that limited capital subsidies from senior levels of government get
expended more quickly, meaning less housing overall. Reducing the cost, time
and risk required to build non-profit and coop housing will result in savings for
residents and deeper affordability in the new housing created;
11. We are in a window of strong alignment between Federal and Provincial
governments in terms of developing affordable and non-profit housing. Some of
these senior government funding programs require approved zoning for eligibility.
Having appropriate municipal zoning in place allows non-profit and co-op housing
providers to access this senior government funding much more easily, speeding
up timelines and achieving deeper levels of affordability;
12. Major redevelopments still include opportunities for public engagement. Even
when they don’t require a public hearing, the Development Permit process
includes public notification and opportunities for comment, and could still require
a Development Permit Hearing process, providing residents an opportunity to
address the Development Permit Board in a public meeting;
13. There are currently about 526 non-profit and government owned housing
properties in Vancouver, serving 26,000 households. 107 of those properties are
in the RM-3A, RM-4 and RM-4N zoning districts;
14. Vancouver’s Tenant Relocation and Protection Policy, updated by Council in
2019, outlines specific protections for tenants in the case of a redevelopment for
non-profit social housing. These protections are more stringent than for for-profit
market development, and include:
a) Ensuring permanent rehousing options that limit disruption to residents;
b) The alternative accommodation option provided must be affordable based
on income; and
c) Support with relocation and consideration of special circumstances;
15. At Public Hearing on April 20, 2021, Council unanimously approved
recommendations to allow development of up to six storeys in the RM-3A and the
RM-4 and RM-4N zoning districts where 100% of the residential floor area is
developed as social housing, or social housing in conjunction with a child day
care facility; and
16. At the above Public Hearing, numerous local experts in non-profit and co-op
housing expressed a need for Council to be more ambitious in terms of both
height and FSR to give non-profit housing providers the flexibility to optimize the
number and affordability of new homes possible on each site. In response, City
legal and planning staff outlined that significant amendments at the Public

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, May 19, 25, 26 and 27, 2021 11
Hearing stage are not ideal, and that if Council wanted to be more ambitious in
this regard, a preferable route would be through a separate Council motion.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to bring forward recommendations for Council to
consider referring to Public Hearing that would allow development of up to 12
storeys (with a corresponding increase in FSR) in the RM-3A and the RM-4 and
RM-4N zoning districts where 100% of the residential floor area is developed as
social housing, or social housing in conjunction with a child day care facility.
B. THAT Council direct staff to report back with considerations and
recommendations to allow additional height and FSR in other zoning districts
(including RS, RT, RM, and mixed commercial-residential zones) where 100% of
the residential floor area is developed as social housing, or social housing in
conjunction with a child day care facility, and any corresponding improvements in
the TRPP that staff would recommend. Consideration should be given, but not
limited, to:
i. Options that could be incorporated as part of current work on the Secured
Rental Policy, including additional height and density specifically for social
housing in new standard rental district schedules intended to streamline
future site-specific rezonings in RS and RT zoned areas, with a report
back to Council targeted in Q3 2021; and
ii. Options, including City-initiated zoning changes, that would enable more
social housing projects to proceed without a rezoning, that could be
delivered as part of longer-term work through the Vancouver Plan, as well
as through the Broadway Plan.

At 8:50 pm, during discussion on the above amendment, Councillor De Genova rose on a point
of order under Section 8.7(f) of the Procedure By-law as staff has already indicated they are
working on elements in the proposed amendment. Following a short recess, the Chair rule
against Councillor De Genova’s point of order; however, the Chair did rule Councillor Fry’s
amendment’s to A. out of order under Section 8.7(d) of the Procedure By-law as the proposed
work conflicts with a previous motion passed by Council related to a moratorium on providing
additional work to the Development Building and Licensing Department via member’s
motions/amendments.
Subsequently, Councillor Kirby-Yung rose on a point of order section 8.7(a) of the Procedure
By-law, noting that in past when one portion of an amendment or motion has been ruled out of
order the remaining portions are then also considered out of order. Following a brief recess, the
Chair ruled in favour of Councillor Kirby-Yung’s point of order and ruled the amendment out of
order in its entirety.

6. Saving Lives With a World Trade Organization (WTO) Trade-Related Aspects of
Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Waiver (Member’s Motion B.3)
At the Council meeting on May 18, 2021, Council referred this motion to the Standing
Committee on Policy and Strategic Priorities meeting on May 19, 2021, in order to hear from
speakers, followed by debate and decision.
The Committee heard from four speakers in support of the motion.

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, May 19, 25, 26 and 27, 2021 16
MOVED by Councillor Swanson
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. The TRIPS (Trade-related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights) Council is a
part of the World Trade Organization (WTO) that enforces intellectual property
like patents, copyright and trade secrets, and reaches decisions on these issues
through the consensus of member countries, including Canada. The TRIPS
Agreement provides a legal framework for dealing with intellectual property
issues internationally
https://guides.ll.georgetown.edu/c.php?g=363556&p=4154931);
2. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacted a high toll among most of the countries
around the world, both in terms of severe illness and mortality;
3. The pandemic cannot be stopped anywhere unless vaccines, tests, and
treatments are available worldwide, including within and between countries;
4. The poor distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and treatments has contributed to a
number of variants that are now being seen in Vancouver, and the continued
transmission that takes place without vaccination allows for more variants to
arise that could evade the vaccine
(https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/03/1087992);
5. Half of the world’s vaccine supply has been bought up by the world’s richest
countries who represent just 16% of the global population;
6. 80% of those who have been vaccinated against COVID-19 live in 10 high-
income countries, including Canada;
7. Canada has voted against the so-called “TRIPS Waiver” three times since
October 2020, while at the same time tapping into a WHO COVID-19 vaccine
supply designated for poor countries (COVAX);
8. Control over who gets access to a vaccine, when, and at what price, is under the
control of a small number of global pharmaceutical companies who have a
monopoly over this life-saving inoculant. This allows these few companies to
charge high prices, prioritize countries that can bid the highest dollar amount,
and inhibit generic production;
9. A research team from Duke University’s Global Health Innovation Center found
that, if current inequities in vaccine access continue, the 92 poorest countries in
the world will be unable to immunize a majority of the people who live there until
2023 at the earliest. This means that people will continue to die or become
severely ill. Kenya expects that they will have only 30% of people vaccinated by
2023 (https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/interactive/2021/coronavirus-
vaccine-inequality-global/);
10. The 2001 Doha Declaration, a statement from the WTO, clarifies that the TRIPS
Agreement can and should be interpreted and implemented with the

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, May 19, 25, 26 and 27, 2021 17
aim "to promote access to medicines for all”
(https://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/minist_e/min01_e/mindecl_trips_e.htm);
11. WTO member countries can agree to waive certain obligations in these treaties
under exceptional circumstances like a global pandemic;
12. If WTO members agree on the waiver, countries can choose not to grant or
enforce intellectual property rights (for patents, industrial designs, copyright and
trade secrets) specifically related to all COVID-19 medical products and
technologies;
13. Waiving these obligations can make COVID vaccinations and drugs cheaper and
can allow more people to produce them faster, thus helping more people;
14. The existing “flexibilities” in the WTO TRIPS Agreement, which allow
governments to manufacture low-cost generic equivalents of patented medicines
or to import the same from a foreign government with more manufacturing
capacity, are important but inadequate in the context of the pandemic, during
which speed of vaccination is of the essence for saving lives and preventing
further variants. These flexibilities are only accessible on a case-by-case,
product-by-product basis, which means they require a cumbersome and complex
process that can take years to settle with patent-holding firms or foreign
governments and do not allow for full global collaboration;
15. South Africa and India, with support from 100 mostly low and middle-income
countries at the WTO, have proposed that patents on COVID-19 vaccines and
treatments be temporarily suspended in compliance with the World Trade
Organization rules in the TRIPS agreement, enabling these nations to immunize
their people. This proposal is widely known as the TRIPS Waiver; and
16. In March, 2021, Oxfam’s Health Policy Manager, Anna Marriott, said: the TRIPs
Waiver is a “massive missed opportunity to speed up and scale up the production
of lifesaving vaccines worldwide by waiving the intellectual property barriers that
prevent more qualified manufacturers joining the effort.” Oxfam is one of
hundreds of organizations that have come out in support of the TRIPS Waiver.
These organizations include: UNAIDS, the Director-General of the World Health
Organization, Médecins Sans Frontières, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty
International, the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, the Canadian Health
Coalition, over 250 organizations and experts involved in education and research
(including Education International, which represents over 30 million teachers
globally) and many more. In addition, more than 170 former heads of state and
government and Nobel laureates have spoken out in support for this measure;
nearly 400 Members of the European Parliament and of national Parliaments
across the EU have signed a joint appeal stating their unequivocal support for the
Waiver; and nearly 1000 Canadian medical students and health advocates and
42 organizations have signed an open letter to Justin Trudeau to support the
Waiver. On May 5th, the United States Trade Representative stated that the US
will support the Waiver at the WTO.

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, May 19, 25, 26 and 27, 2021 18
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct the Mayor to call on the
Government of Canada to support the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property
Rights (TRIPS) Waiver “for the Prevention, Containment and Treatment of COVID-19”.

MOVED by Councillor Fry
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. Commercial Drive from Venables to Broadway is known for its authentic and
unique character; with its Continental vibe, important community and heritage
significance, eclectic and artistic inclination, and vibrant small business and
gastronomic disposition, ‘The Drive’ is where cultures meet to shop, eat and
socialize;
2. The Drive is one of Vancouver’s oldest roadways. Once a logging skid road, later
an interurban streetcar line; Commercial Drive retains some anachronistic road
geometry, notably, it is wider south and narrower north of 1st Avenue;
3. Today, the Drive serves as a high street for the Grandview-Woodland
neighbourhood and a commercial destination for the region. With its lively
granular streetscape of smaller shops and services, The Drive is first and
foremost an accessible, pedestrian-friendly street;
4. The Grandview-Woodland Community Plan 1, approved by Council in 2016,
variously calls for:
a. Preserving the heart and soul of the community, the independent and
eclectic nature of The Drive;

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, May 19, 25, 26 and 27, 2021 19
b. Renewing, improving and expanding public spaces, placemaking, and
opportunities for social and cultural amenities, and critical infrastructure;
c. Developing a vision for Commercial Drive as a complete street, with key
design principles that could include:
i. Providing direct and convenient access to shops and services for
all modes of transportation;
ii. Safety and comfort for all modes, with a focus on people walking
and cycling;
iii. Carefully considering impacts to transit, general traffic, nearby
streets, parking, services and deliveries, pick-ups and drop-offs,
and viability of local businesses;
iv. Considering flexible design approaches that facilitate special
events; and
v. Exploring opportunities to integrate sustainable rainwater
management techniques.
The Plan explicitly does not propose a conceptual design but prescribes
community consultation prior to any project consideration by Council;
5. Tactical urbanism and placemaking initiatives like VIVA Vancouver and the City of
Vancouver Places for People 2 program champion an approach to public space
planning, design, and stewardship in the City that is grounded in an evidence-
based understanding of public life, and in response to increasing urban density,
puts people’s experience and use of the public realm at the forefront of public
space design and decision- making. The intent: to address affordability and
smaller living spaces, loneliness and weak social networks, connections and
accessibility, and vibrant and dynamic public life with everyday experiences,
events and activities that serve all people;
6. In response to 2019 motions supporting Slower Safer Streets and Safer Routes
to Schools, as well as the COVID-19 pandemic, the City of Vancouver has
adopted a Making Streets for People 3 program, which aligns with the City’s long-
standing commitment to VisionZero and supports Pop-Up Plazas, the Expedited
Patio Program and Slow Streets;
7. Creating a safe, accessible, and enjoyable walking environment is Vancouver’s
top priority4. More comfortable, safer and accessible walking for people of all
ages and abilities and a pedestrians-first model are championed by various city
policies and public bodies like the Seniors’ Advisory and Persons with Disabilities
Committees;
8. The City of Vancouver’s Healthy City Strategy5 articulates a number of long-term
goals for the physical and mental well-being of the City and its people, including:
Active living and getting outside; Getting around; Cultivating connections;
Expressing ourselves; Environments to thrive in; and Making ends meet and

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, May 19, 25, 26 and 27, 2021 20
working well;
9. Vancouver’s Climate Emergency Action Plan6 Big Move #1 articulates support for
walkable, complete neighbourhoods “Planning for more residents to be within
walking distance of their daily needs through land use changes is fundamental to
the success of the plan. This enables more people to walk or roll to access their
local needs and to rely on vehicles less”;
10. The City of Vancouver officially designated eight blocks of Commercial Drive
between East 4th Avenue and Charles Street as “Historic Little
Italy 7” in 2016. In 2019, Council approved a motion titled Celebrating Italian
Culture8: Welcome Signage in Little Italy and a Pilot Program for an Italian
Piazza. The resolution further seeks opportunities for local artisans,
restauranteurs, proprietors and vendors to support outdoor activations and
events on The Drive;
11. In response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, the City’s Moving Vancouver
Forward: Economic and community recovery strategy9 has highlighted
repurposing public spaces for gathering spaces and recreation, making streets
for people, and repurposing public and private space to allow for more patio
spaces for businesses as important recovery initiatives;
12. The Commercial Drive BIA, with support and research involving the community
and local businesses have published a vision for Pedestrian First Commercial
High Street10. This Pedestrian First Vision is for The Drive to evolve into a more
pedestrian-friendly street, vibrant, accessible and, first and foremost, walkable
while at the same time supporting business viability so that it remains a highly
desirable local and regional commercial destination.
This vision includes:
a. Slowing the street, with a priority around sharing the street for all users
and not promoting The Drive as a traffic connector/corridor;
b. Widening sidewalks and enhancing crosswalks for pedestrians, including
seniors and the mobility-challenged;
c. Promoting a “stop & shop” model for all modes of transportation including
walking, rolling, cycling, public transit, and private vehicles;
d. Recognizing the urgent need to create room including more linear space
for safe physical distancing while walking, cycling, and shopping, as well
as supporting outside dining and vending;
e. Enhancing the public realm and streetscape with seating, landscaping,
pedestrian lighting, street furniture, plazas and piazzas, bike racks,
decorative cross walks, public art, and placemaking;
f. Working with the BIA, City, and local artists to support public art and
painted intersections that celebrate and pay tribute to the vibrant cultures
and peoples who make up the heartbeat and history of the Drive,

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, May 19, 25, 26 and 27, 2021 21
including Italian, Indigenous, and 2SLGBTQ+ communities;
g. Enhance secure bike locking infrastructure, incorporating bike docking
stations on parallel side streets;
h. Maintaining and improving East-West bike connections to compliment
existing nearby bike lane networks at Woodland, Lakewood, East 10th
Avenue and the Central Valley Greenway as well as potential new
separated bike lane on Victoria Drive;
i. Maintaining and improving on-street parking spaces to support local
businesses;
j. Reduce number of travel lanes south of 1st Avenue, adjusting travel
lanes, parking, and parklets so that they are consistent along The Drive;
k. Request Council prioritize Commercial as “Pedestrian First Commercial
High Street.”; and
13. With the opportunity for a European style street (in Italy and some other
Mediterranean countries, a corso is a social promenade, a place for strolling and
shopping, especially in a public place for pleasure or display) that promotes
shared access, enhanced public realm and a vibrant, sustainable local and
regional economy supporting the “stop & shop” model; The Drive BIA vision
aligns with City priorities of slower, safer streets and healthy, complete
communities, and economic and community recovery strategies.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council supports the vision for prioritizing Commercial Drive as Pedestrian
First Commercial High Street, specifically:
a. A slow street, shared by all users that supports a stop and shop model
instead of a connector role;
b. Widened sidewalks and enhanced crosswalks;
c. Space for physical distancing while walking, cycling and shopping that
also supports outside dining and vending;
d. Support for community-led public art and placemaking;
e. Enhanced bike locking infrastructure, and enhanced east-west bike route
connections, with bike share docking stations on side streets;
f. Reducing the number of travel lanes south of 1st Avenue to create a
consistent road geometry; and
g. Maintaining and improving on-street parking to support local businesses.

9. Mitigating and Managing Nuisance Graffiti in Vancouver (Member's Motion B.6)
At the Council meeting on May 18, 2021, Council referred this motion to the Standing
Committee on Policy and Strategic Priorities meeting on May 19, 2021, in order to hear from
speakers, followed by debate and decision.
The Committee heard from three speakers in support of the motion and one speaker in
opposition to the motion.

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, May 19, 25, 26 and 27, 2021 26
MOVED by Councillor Fry
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. Graffiti is a form of unauthorized and quasi-anonymous visual communication
dating back thousands of years and spanning cultures and continents. Ancient
examples of graffiti can be found among the ruins of Pompeii, tombs of Europe,
conquests of the Crusaders, and ancient civilizations from Vikings to Mayans;
2. Graffiti is a form of self expression that may variously manifest as social or
political statements, as street art or guerrilla marketing, as well as gang symbols,
intimidation, and tagging (personal visual identifiers);
3. Since the emergence of hip hop in the 1970’s and graffiti as one of its four
elements; spray paint street art has evolved a variety of styles from simple tags
to elaborate murals, and elevated graffiti to an artform and cultural phenomenon;
4. Today, graffiti includes paste-ups, stickers, and etchings as well as elaborate wall
murals using many different media. The renaissance of street art manifests in
everything from corporate advertising1, to place-making initiatives like the
Vancouver Mural Fest2, to record-breaking3 art sales at auction;
5. Street tagging in particular is a ubiquitous form of graffiti. Quick and stealthily
applied ciphers, signatures, and logos identify the “tagger”, and are virtually
impossible to catch in the act. Tags are found on everything from walls and
windows to street utilities and vehicles. Studies of urban graffiti by Keep America
Beautiful with data from 17 cities estimate 78-80% of graffiti is tagger graffiti;
6. Psychological profiles of street taggers point to boredom, status, non-conformity,
and adrenaline rush as motivators and rewards that compel them to tag more.
Taggers have been shown to variously neutralize impacts of their compulsion,
primarily because they see tagging as a “victimless crime.” 4;
7. Graffiti is up 67% across the City on public property, and the neighbourhoods
seeing the highest number of graffiti tags are Downtown, Grandview-Woodland,
Mount Pleasant, Strathcona, Kensington-Cedar Cottage, and Kitsilano;
8. Graffiti removal is a significant line item for a number of BIAs in Vancouver. For
instance, the Downtown Vancouver BIA has budgeted $575,257 in this fiscal
year for in-house and contracted graffiti management. Since the COVID-19
pandemic, less eyes on the street, more boarded up storefronts, and a frustrated
population have led to a noticeable uptick in graffiti and street tagging.5 Across
the city, nuisance graffiti has seen a significant increase;
9. A variety of remediation techniques and private companies have been deployed
to manage graffiti in Vancouver and cities everywhere, including detergents,
solvents, scrapers, pressure washers, sandblasters, and paint restoration.
Additionally preventative measures including resistant paints, coatings and

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, May 19, 25, 26 and 27, 2021 27
surfaces are available. In the United States, graffiti removal and damage is
estimated to cost $12 billion a year 6;
10. Anecdotal and empirical evidence both suggest that the presence of un-
remediated graffiti begets more graffiti. Controversial studies suggest that the
presence of graffiti leads to more crime, though it is important to recognize that
correlation does not equal causation and as a form of self-expression graffiti may
be more accessible and endemic to lower income communities;
11. Many cities hard hit by graffiti have developed systems to photograph, analyze,
identify and catalogue chronic taggers. Police, graffiti abatement, parking
enforcement, and other city employees assist by photographing and
documenting tags. Armed with documentation and location of tags, cities are
using digital tools to help identify, track, prosecute and seek restitution from
graffiti vandals for the extent of their damages. San Diego County cites one
successful prosecution where a singular tagger was identified in 217 incidents,
and fined $87,000 in repairs and restitution.7 Web-based app Graffiti Tracker
claims to have analyzed nearly 6 million photos, facilitating over 4,000 arrests
and over $10m in restitution8;
12. The City of Vancouver defines graffiti as “one or more letters, symbols or marks,
howsoever made, on any structure or thing” placed without the property owner or
tenant’s prior, written authorization. Graffiti By-law 7343 9 prevents the
unsightliness of property by prohibiting graffiti and requiring properties be kept
free of graffiti. Under the by-law, property owners are required to remove
unauthorized graffiti within 10 days of receiving a notice. Under the by-law, the
minimum fine and penalty for anyone doing graffiti without authorization is $500
for each offence;
13. The City of Vancouver supports an Integrated Graffiti Management Program
(IGMP) that provides strategic direction and programs to manage graffiti and
graffiti removal services on public property;
14. The City of Vancouver additionally supports a Free Paint Program in partnership
with Dulux Paints, where Vancouver property owners and tenants can receive up
to two gallons in a calendar year of free exterior paint for the removal of existing
graffiti10; and
15. Despite the explosion of curated street art to support placemaking and graffiti-
style arts (ie. Vancouver Mural Fest), many cities have sanctioned areas to
support unauthorized graffiti and self expression, for example 5Pointz in New
York, Hosier Lane in Melbourne, Sydhaven in Copenhagen, Raleigh Free
Expression Tunnel in North Carolina, Venice Graffiti Pit in Los Angeles, and
Toronto’s Graffiti Alley (one of several designated exempt zones developed by
Toronto’s Graffiti Management Plan, local property owners and BIAs11). These
locations are freely and regularly painted and repainted and have become

10. Granville Street Promenade - A People First, Pedestrian Friendly, Summer 2021
Pilot (Member’s Motion B.7)
At the Council meeting on May 18, 2021, Council referred this motion to the Standing
Committee on Policy and Strategic Priorities meeting on May 19, 2021, in order to hear from
speakers, followed by debate and decision.
The Committee heard from six speakers in support of the motion.

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, May 19, 25, 26 and 27, 2021 32
MOVED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. At the Standing Committee of Council on Finance and City Services on May 13,
2020, Council unanimously approved the motion Flexible, Innovative and
Expedited Patio Permitting. With the continuing pandemic, Council also approved
a follow-up motion to extend the program in September, 2020 to provide ongoing
support for restaurants and craft breweries; over 500 permits have been
approved attesting to the need for and utility of the program;
2. The May 2020 motion also called for the creation of pop-up plazas and space for
people to safely enjoy outdoors. Since, activation of nine pop-up plazas by BIA’s
have been put in place in multiple neighbourhoods, and have been popular and
well-enjoyed spaces during Covid;
3. The Covid-19 pandemic has had a devastating economic impact on Vancouver’s
restaurant and hospitality sector, particularly on Granville Street being among the
first closed and anticipated to be among the last to reopen due to public health
orders;
4. On May 3, 2021, Dr. Bonnie Henry announced that no large-scale events would
be permitted this summer, further underlining the need for places for people to
safely enjoy outdoors;
5. Granville Street is slated for an upcoming planning process designed to revitalize
and maximize this cultural and entertainment destination; a public space project
could help inform future opportunities for the area and help the City move
towards a more vibrant and people-focused City in a new, post-COVID world;
6. Local musicians and artists have also been hard hit by Covid losing opportunities
to perform and connect with people;
7. Examples of people-first activations in other cities include Montreal where
several blocks of Sainte-Catherine Street are shut down to car traffic in the spring
and summer to make way to entertainment, sidewalk sales and more, and
Toronto’s King Street Transit Priority Corridor;
8. Increased public spaces support our local economy, enhance our social fabric
and the vitality of placemaking in our City;
9. Social isolation and the mental health impacts of the pandemic are real; giving
people places to safely gather outside can help overcome these challenges;
10. The responsiveness demonstrated by the City of Vancouver to adapt quickly to
support small business and residents has been a lifeline and demonstrated what
a positive economic and social impact the City can have when we are more
creative with public space;

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, May 19, 25, 26 and 27, 2021 33
11. TransLink has seen a significant drop in ridership during Covid and aims to
support local business and initiatives that will encourage people to get back on
the bus;
12. A Summer 2021 people-first and pedestrian-friendly public space pilot could
support welcoming people back to the street, support expanded pop-up plazas
and local businesses; and
13. Public response to the idea of increasing space for the public and supporting
businesses, has been positive from residents, local business, the Downtown
Vancouver Business Improvement Association (DVBIA), Hospitality Vancouver
Association (HVA), TransLink, Music BC, and local musicians.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council affirms its support for a Summer 2021 Granville Street Promenade
pilot and direct staff to work with the Downtown Vancouver Business
Improvement Association, Hospitality Vancouver Association and TransLink to
support a people-first pedestrian-friendly public space initiative for July through
September, with final dates to be confirmed upon discussion with partners.
B. THAT Council acknowledges the intended area for the Summer 2021 pilot is
envisioned to be on Granville Street from Smithe to Helmcken and that the goal
is for the space to be bus and car free on weekends (Friday Nights, Saturdays
and Sundays).
C. THAT the pilot Granville Street Promenade activation is envisioned to support
local businesses through the Temporary Expedited Patio Program, have open,
accessible commons-style public seating and decor, have designated area for
local musicians to perform through partnerships with the TransLink Busker
Program and/or Music BC as facilitated by the Downtown Vancouver Business
Improvement Association, as well as potential local artist displays.
The Downtown Vancouver Business Improvement Association will also explore
the feasibility of activations on the blocks north of Smithe to Pender (since these
blocks are for authorized vehicles only, rerouted buses for the vehicle-free pilot in
B above may create opportunities for further activations here as well).
D. THAT the parties work together to ensure clear signage for the public with
respect to changes to bus routing, as well as any identified taxi and ride share
drop off zones on cross streets.
E. THAT Council direct staff to report back on the results and learnings from the
Summer 2021 pilot by the end of January 2022, including options for continuing
similar initiatives on Granville Street annually as part of Vancouver’s rethink of
public space use in a new post-pandemic world.
