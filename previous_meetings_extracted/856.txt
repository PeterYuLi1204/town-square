2. Election Finance: Transparent Funding in Local Politics
At the Council meeting on January 21, 2020, Council referred the following motion to the
Standing Committee on City Finance and Services meeting on January 22, 2020, in order to
hear from speakers.
At the Standing Committee on City Finance and Services meeting on January 22 and 28, 2020,
the Committee heard from speakers and referred debate and decision of the following item to
the Council meeting on February 11, 2020, as unfinished business.
MOVED by Councillor Fry
SECONDED by Councillor Bligh
WHEREAS
1. Elections, election campaigns, referendums, and political operations should have
transparent and compliant contributor funding so elected officials are free from
real or perceived potential conflicts of interest, which undermine their duty to
represent the people they were elected to serve;
2. The federal and provincial levels of government have laws regarding political
financing which apply at all times and require that all political contributions be
made by individuals, that individuals have yearly contribution limits, and that
political parties must make annual public disclosures reporting received
contributions and their contributors;
3. In 2017 the B.C. legislature amended the Local Elections Campaign Financing
Act (LECFA), banning special interest and corporate political donations at the
local government level during an election year, placing limits on contributions and
mandating public disclosures. However, the LECFA only applies to electoral
organizations and candidates during an election year for the specific purpose of
campaigning, or the last 28 days before the election in the case of a third party
sponsor;
4. The LECFA does not regulate local electoral organizations in non-election years
or during an election year for their normal activities that are not part of their
election campaigns. Local electoral organizations have separate operating bank
accounts for these purposes and can accept unlimited donations from
corporations and special interests. The LECFA regulations do not require any
public disclosures of electoral organization operating bank accounts, nor do they
place maximum donation limits, or prevent corporations and special interests
from contributing to municipal political organizations;

Council Meeting
Minutes, February 11, 2020 7
5. Local Elector Organizations can have a significant impact and influence on local
politics, and on who becomes an elected official. This happens both during a
campaign and outside of campaign periods. Extending the LECFA contribution
restrictions, annual reporting and disclosure requirements, and including the
electoral organization operating account would create a level playing field for all
electoral organizations, improve transparency and limit contributions to compliant
BC residents only;
6. Third party sponsors can also have a significant impact and influence on local
politics and on who becomes an elected official or on a ballot question. In the
2018 Vancouver local election there were examples of significant unreported
third party spending prior to the election, which ended only 28 days before the
election, notwithstanding the intent of the LECFA;
7. The June 2019 City of Vancouver-convened volunteer-led Independent Election
Task Force on Campaign Finance Regulations 1 encouraged the City of
Vancouver to strongly urge the provincial government to improve upon the
existing campaign finance laws, along with specific recommendations:
7.1. To enhance transparency in campaign financing, require all donations to
candidates, elector organizations and third parties to be donated to a
centralized portal run by Elections BC with real time disclosure of
donations.
7.2. THAT the Independent Elections Task Force be reconvened to review the
following policy proposals, which have not previously been considered by
Council, and provide recommendations regarding: Appropriate regulation
of third-party groups wishing to engage on policy during municipal
elections; The suggestion that contributions to candidates running with
elector organizations to be in line with contributions to candidates running
as independents.;
8. The October 2019 Elections BC Report of the Chief Electoral Officer
2 recommendations on Improving Accessibility, Transparency and Compliance
included the following:
8.1. An elector organization is an organization that endorses or intends to
endorse a candidate in an election.
8.2. Require elector organizations to register with Elections BC and file annual
disclosure statements including reports of all financial transactions,
similar to those filed by provincial political parties. Maintain the
membership requirement (50 members) for elector organizations as
prescribed by s. 93(2)(a) of the Local Government Act.;
9. Political finance regulations are the cornerstone of responsible government.
Contribution limits and transparency requirements are necessary safeguards
which prevent corruption and undue influence and ensure accountability of
elected officials to the public.

Council Meeting
Minutes, February 11, 2020 8
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council affirms a commitment to full and transparent reporting of financial
contributions to elector organizations and candidates both during a campaign
and outside of campaign periods, including contributions to operating expenses.
B. THAT Council reconvene the Independent Election Task Force, to review policy
questions laid out under the report’s Current Mandate proposal.
C. THAT Council direct staff to submit the following resolution along with the above
preamble (articles 3, 8) for consideration at the Lower Mainland Local
Government Association and/or working with other municipalities to present at
Union of BC Municipalities:
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT the Union of BC Municipalities
request that the Province amend the Local Elections Campaign Financing
Act to apply contributor and contribution limits to operating accounts of
elector organizations and candidates for operational purposes at all times,
and to require that they provide annual disclosure reports of contributions
received in operating bank accounts, in election years and non-election
years;
AND FURTHER THAT Third Party Sponsors be required to provide
disclosure reports for the full election year or the date that a referendum
is announced, whichever is later.

2. Bill 15, Local Elections Campaign Financing Amendment Act,
2017 received Royal Assent on November 30, 2017, resulting in

election in B.C., an eligible individual may contribute up to $1,200
per year per campaign to an unendorsed candidate or $1,200 in
total to each campaign of an elector organization and its endorsed
candidates.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT the Union of B.C. Municipalities
request the Province support personal income tax credits, for

Tax Act, for personal income tax credits for federal and provincial political
contributions;
AND FURTHER THAT the Minister of Municipal Affairs of B.C. write a

Council heard from two speakers in support of the recommendations.
MOVED by Councillor De Genova
SECONDED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
A. THAT Council direct staff to consider accepting a rezoning application to
consider redevelopment of the Ashley Mar Housing Cooperative Site at 8460 Ash
Street and 8495 Cambie Street with building heights beyond those envisaged in
the Marpole Community Plan, in order to provide social housing and market
rental units, noting that the supportable height and density will be determined
through an enhanced rezoning process, which will include robust public
consultation, urban design and technical analyses as well as a public hearing.
B. THAT Council direct staff to consider rezoning enquiries for other existing social
housing sites, or sites designated as inclusionary housing sites, within the Marine
Drive Station Area boundary defined in the Report dated January 28, 2020,
entitled “Issues Report – Addressing Housing Priorities for the Ashley Mar
Housing Cooperative Site and Other Social Housing and Inclusionary Housing
Sites in the Marine Drive Station Area”, through updated area analyses to
determine their appropriateness and capacity for accommodating additional
height beyond those envisaged in the Marpole Community Plan to address
Council’s housing priorities, generally using the criteria outlined in the same
report.
C. THAT the passage of the A and B above will in no way fetter Council’s discretion
in considering any rezoning applications or referral of any rezoning applications
to public hearing, and does not create any legal rights for any person or
obligation on the part of the City; any expenditures of funds or incurring of costs
is at the risk of the person making the expenditure or incurring the costs.

3. Transparency and Accountability at Little Mountain
MOVED by Councillor Boyle
SECONDED by Councillor Carr
WHEREAS
1. Social housing was first built at Little Mountain in the 1950s;
2. Vancouver, British Columbia, and the Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation
(Canada) first signed an agreement in November 1950, which stipulated that all
social housing on the Little Mountain site must be replaced should the original
structures be demolished;
3. 224 units of social housing were built at Little Mountain and remained on the site
until 2009;
4. Residents at Little Mountain began being encouraged to relocate to other social
housing in March 2007. BC Housing assured residents that they would be able to
return to their new homes on the site by the time of the Olympics in 2010;
5. Many residents resisted moving and were supported by thousands of their
neighbours and other Vancouver residents;
6. The original residents recommended that the public land at Little Mountain not be
privatized. Residents recommended that instead of simply replacing the
demolished 224 units of social housing hundreds more social housing units
should be built, and that any redevelopment should be done in phases so that
residents could stay in their homes with the least amount of disruption;

Council Meeting
Minutes, February 11, 2020 23
7. All but 4 units on the site were demolished in November 2009;
8. As a result of the refusal of 4 residents to move, one building replacing only 53
units of the original 224 units of social housing was built, and today the rest of the
Little Mountain site is a large, 15 acre vacant lot;
9. In the twelve years since 2007 Vancouver has suffered through an intensifying
crisis of homelessness and unaffordable housing;
10. BC Housing entered into an agreement for the sale of the property with Holborn
Development Company in 2008, though the sale was apparently not finalized
until 2013, with two amendments to the 2013 contract since then;
11. The contract has not yet been made public. The original residents and other
members of the community have been asking to see the agreement for sale and
contract for twelve years. The City of Vancouver has previously requested to see
the contract but was not able to;
12. It is in the interest of Vancouver residents and the City of Vancouver that there
be transparency regarding the sale of this significant public asset. Disclosure of
the contract would provide new and relevant information to the public that
previously was unknown, serve the public’s interest in sound financial
management by government, and help determine whether the developer has
dealt fairly with the public;
13. Details that have emerged from recent Vancouver Sun investigative reporting
suggest that the terms of the sale favoured the purchaser in unusual ways,
including payment for the land being structured to extend over decades;
14. The loss of the then existing social housing has created, among many Vancouver
residents, cynicism and loss of confidence in the public process;
15. Application has been made through BC Freedom of Information Legislation for
disclosure of the contract between BC Housing and Holborn Developments
(OIPC File No.: F18-75849 & F18-76353 - Public Body File No.: 292-30- 3418)
This FOI application will be adjudicated in the coming weeks;
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that in the interest of full transparency and providing
information instructive to the City of Vancouver in future developments, Council express
its support for the Freedom of Information application, and direct the Mayor to write a
letter to the Riley Park South Cambie Visions Committee indicating support for full
disclosure of the contract.

4. Cultural Spaces Rent Bank
MOVED by Councillor Fry
SECONDED by Councillor Carr
WHEREAS
1. Vancouver has over 400 cultural spaces totalling over 3.4 million square feet,
that are home to everything from artist-run centres, to galleries, to rehearsal
spaces and shared studios;
2. Vancouver’s recent Culture|Shift and Making Space for Arts and Culture reports
identify cultural spaces as extremely vulnerable, with one third of all spaces in
leases of one year or less, and most of those are month-to-month;
3. Rent banks utilize a pool of capital to provide short term loans to applicants that
encounter an unforeseen inability to meet financial obligations arising from rent,
rent increases or rent-related expenditures;
4. Rent banks are designed to prevent evictions and stabilize housing for working
people living on low incomes. Ultimately, the goal is to prevent a short-term
financial crisis from turning into homelessness;
5. A typical rent bank provides loans to renter households who have regular income
but an inability to secure a conventional loan and are facing eviction as a result of
a short-term financial crisis like illness, job loss, unexpected expenses,
relationship breakdown or eviction. The loans are low- or no-cost and have
generous repayment terms – usually up to 24 months;
6. Rent banks exist throughout Canada, including Toronto, across the Lower
Mainland and notably here in Vancouver. The Vancouver Rent Bank is supported
in part by the City of Vancouver and leverages multi-sectoral partnerships
(including foundations, banks, post-secondary institutions, and not for profit
service providers) for capital and operating funding, expertise and other services;
7. The Vancouver Rent Bank receives funding from the City and other partner
organizations including Vancouver Foundation, VanCity and Street to Home.
Applicants can apply for up to two months' worth of rental arrears (past-due rent),
damage deposits, and basic utilities. According to internal audit figures The rate
of loan repayment to Vancouver Rent Bank is 67%;
8. The Province of British Columbia recently invested $10 million toward the
creation of a province-wide rent bank as part of TogetherBC the provincial
poverty reduction strategy (June 2019);
9. Many cultural spaces face the same factors of precariousness as working
tenants with low incomes including month-to-month cash flow, inability to secure
conventional loan, or unexpected disruptions like illness;
10. Few cultural spaces are afforded the protections enshrined in the Residential
Tenancy Act, and can be faced with unexpected rent hikes, taxes, insurance, or
maintenance fees;

Council Meeting
Minutes, February 11, 2020 25
11. Vancouver’s Culture|Shift and Making Space for Arts and Culture
recommendations commit to no net loss of Cultural Spaces;
12. The City of Vancouver provides a limited number of operating and capital cultural
grants based on a rigorous and peer-reviewed process, but by design the City
cannot furnish grants to all applicants nor on a quick turnaround;
13. Rent bank loans improve security for renters. Currently, there is limited or no
ability for Non Profit Organizations or individual artists to gain loans of this kind,
and a rent bank would fill a demonstrated need.
THERFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council supports the diverse ecosystem of Vancouver’s cultural spaces,
and recognizes the breadth of challenges to operating Cultural Spaces in our city
including unexpected expenses and cash flow issues.
B. THAT Council direct staff to explore the creation of a Cultural Spaces Rent Bank,
modeled after the Vancouver Rent Bank, in order to protect precarious cultural
spaces by making short term or bridge-funding loans available to qualified
applicants, with the following considerations:
i) How to screen applicants and operationalize loan repayments;
ii) Lending criteria and limits;
iii) Legal Considerations;
iv) Terms and Conditions of loans, repayments and surety as applicable;
v) Seed capital for lending pool, including but not limited to remainder from
2019 Innovation Fund;
vi) Potential partnerships for capital and operations; and
vii) Value for money.
C. THAT Council direct staff to report back before end of Q4 2020 with
recommendations for a cultural spaces rent bank and in the context of other work
related to implementing Making Space for Arts and Culture.

Council Meeting
Minutes, February 11, 2020 29
6. Recognizing January 27th as International Holocaust Remembrance Day
MOVED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
SECONDED by Councillor De Genova
WHEREAS
1. In 2005, the U.N. General Assembly designated January 27 – the anniversary of
the liberation of the largest Nazi concentration and death camp Auschwitz-
Birkenau – as International Holocaust Remembrance Day (IHRD). 2020 marks
the 75th anniversary of liberation.
2. The U.N. resolution that created IHRD rejects denial of the Holocaust and
condemns discrimination and violence based on religion or ethnicity.
3. Canada offers refuge and new hope to immigrants, refugees and survivors, some
of whom have escaped more recent genocides – and it is a place where people
can learn from each other and share cultures.
4. IHRD has become a symbol of great importance to the broader and to
Vancouver’s Jewish community to commemorate and honour the victims of the
Nazi era.
5. International Holocaust Remembrance Day is officially observed by the United
Nations, countries including Canada, Italy and Germany, as well as many cities
such as Calgary, Ottawa and Montreal.
6. Antisemitism is on the rise around the world, in Canada, and in Vancouver.
Hatred has flourished in the digital age. It is more important than ever that the
lessons learned and horrors of the Holocaust remain present in the public
consciousness so they are never repeated.
7. As we reflect upon that dark period in history and remember the atrocities
perpetrated during the Holocaust, Vancouver has the opportunity to join with
Vancouver’s Jewish community and Canadians from all walks of life in
demonstrating our commitment to stand against antisemitism, hate and
genocide.
8. Vancouver is home to the third largest Jewish community in Canada, and home
to a significant number of Holocaust Survivors and their families.
9. By proclaiming January 27th as International Holocaust Remembrance Day, it
will be an opportunity to create greater public understanding and awareness of
this horrific period in history where over 6,000,000 innocent Jewish men, women
and children were systematically murdered by the Nazi regime and its
collaborators from 1933 to 1945.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council declare January 27th as International
Holocaust Remembrance Day, adding it to its official observances calendar;

CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY (Vote No. 05498)
The amended having carried unanimously, the amended motion was put and CARRIED
UNANIMOUSLY (Vote No. 05510).
FINAL MOTION AS APPROVED
WHEREAS
1. Elections, election campaigns, referendums, and political operations should have
transparent and compliant contributor funding so elected officials are free from
real or perceived potential conflicts of interest, which undermine their duty to
represent the people they were elected to serve;
2. The federal and provincial levels of government have laws regarding political
financing which apply at all times and require that all political contributions be
made by individuals, that individuals have yearly contribution limits, and that
political parties must make annual public disclosures reporting received
contributions and their contributors;

Council Meeting
Minutes, February 11, 2020 34
3. In 2017 the B.C. legislature amended the Local Elections Campaign Financing
Act (LECFA), banning special interest and corporate political donations at the
local government level during an election year, placing limits on contributions and
mandating public disclosures. However, the LECFA only applies to electoral
organizations and candidates during an election year for the specific purpose of
campaigning, or the last 28 days before the election in the case of a third party
sponsor;
4. The LECFA does not regulate local electoral organizations in non-election years
or during an election year for their normal activities that are not part of their
election campaigns. Local electoral organizations have separate operating bank
accounts for these purposes and can accept unlimited donations from
corporations and special interests. The LECFA regulations do not require any
public disclosures of electoral organization operating bank accounts, nor do they
place maximum donation limits, or prevent corporations and special interests
from contributing to municipal political organizations;
5. Local Elector Organizations can have a significant impact and influence on local
politics, and on who becomes an elected official. This happens both during a
campaign and outside of campaign periods. Extending the LECFA contribution
restrictions, annual reporting and disclosure requirements, and including the
electoral organization operating account would create a level playing field for all
electoral organizations, improve transparency and limit contributions to compliant
BC residents only;
6. Third party sponsors can also have a significant impact and influence on local
politics and on who becomes an elected official or on a ballot question. In the
2018 Vancouver local election there were examples of significant unreported
third party spending prior to the election, which ended only 28 days before the
election, notwithstanding the intent of the LECFA;
7. The June 2019 City of Vancouver-convened volunteer-led Independent Election
Task Force on Campaign Finance Regulations 1 encouraged the City of
Vancouver to strongly urge the provincial government to improve upon the
existing campaign finance laws, along with specific recommendations and
mandate respectively:
7.1. To enhance transparency in campaign financing, require all donations to
candidates, elector organizations and third parties to be donated to a
centralized portal run by Elections BC with real time disclosure of
donations.
7.2. THAT the Independent Elections Task Force be reconvened to review the
following policy proposals, which have not previously been considered by
Council, and provide recommendations regarding: Appropriate regulation
of third-party groups wishing to engage on policy during municipal
elections; The suggestion that contributions to candidates running with
elector organizations to be in line with contributions to candidates running
as independents.;

Council Meeting
Minutes, February 11, 2020 35
8. The October 2018 Elections BC Report of the Chief Electoral Officer provided
two recommendations on Improving Accessibility, Transparency and Compliance
were were as follows:
8.1. An elector organization is an organization that endorses or intends to
endorse a candidate in an election.
8.2. Require elector organizations to register with Elections BC and file annual
disclosure statements including reports of all financial transactions,
similar to those filed by provincial political parties. Maintain the
membership requirement (50 members) for elector organizations as
prescribed by s. 93(2)(a) of the Local Government Act.;
9. Political finance regulations are the cornerstone of responsible government.
Contribution limits and transparency requirements are necessary safeguards
which prevent corruption and undue influence and ensure accountability of
elected officials to the public.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council affirms a commitment to full and transparent reporting of financial
contributions to elector organizations and candidates, as well as full and
transparent reporting by third party entities that engage in significant campaign
activities in support of candidates or endorsed candidates, and that all financial
transactions – both during a campaign and outside of campaign periods – be
reported, including contributions toward operating accounts and operating
expenses, including those of third party entities used for campaign and
non-campaign political purposes and activities.
B. THAT Council direct staff to submit the following resolution along with the above
preamble (articles 3, 8) for consideration at the Lower Mainland Local
Government Association and/or working with other municipalities to present at
Union of BC Municipalities:
THEREFORE IT BE RESOLVED THAT the Union of BC Municipalities
request that the Province amend the Local Elections Campaign Financing
Act to apply contributor and contribution limits to operating accounts of
elector organizations and candidates for operational purposes at all times,
and to require that they provide annual disclosure reports of contributions
received in operating bank accounts, in election years and non-election
years;
AND FURTHER THAT Third Party Sponsors be required to provide
disclosure reports for the full election year or the date that a referendum
is announced, whichever is later.
C. THAT Council direct staff to submit the following resolution for consideration at
the Lower Mainland Local Government Association and to the Union of BC
Municipalities, and/or work with municipalities that have submitted similar
language before this submission.

1. i) The Canada Revenue Agency cites the Income Tax Act
for the deduction from tax otherwise payable of a portion of the
total eligible amount of monetary contributions to a registered
party, a provincial division of a registered party, a registered
association, or a candidate, as those terms are defined in the
Canada Elections Act. The maximum annual tax credit an
eligible individual may claim is $650.00 Contributions to a
Registered Party, a Registered Association or to a
Candidate(s) in a federal election.

contributions in excess of $550.
2. Bill 15, Local Elections Campaign Financing Amendment Act,
2017 received Royal Assent on November 30, 2017, resulting in
many changes to the financing provisions of the Local Elections
Campaign Financing Act. The rules applied to the 2018 General
Local Elections and are retroactive to October 31, 2017. In local
election in B.C., an eligible individual may contribute up to $1,200
per year per campaign to an unendorsed candidate or $1,200 in
total to each campaign of an elector organization and its endorsed
candidates.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVEDTHAT the Union of B.C. Municipalities
request the Province support personal income tax credits, for
contributions made in compliance with the B.C. Local Elections Campaign
Financing Act, as is similar to the rules and requirements in B.C.’s Income
Tax Act, for personal income tax credits for provincial political
contributions.
AND FURTHER THAT the Union of B.C. Municipalities request the
Minister of Municipal Affairs of B.C. write a letter to B.C.’s Minister of
Finance and request the Provincial government make necessary
amendments to B.C.’s Income Tax Act to allow eligible individuals to
claim credit on a T1 income tax return for political contributions made in
accordance to the B.C. Local Elections Campaign Financing Act.
D. THAT Council direct staff to submit the following resolution for consideration at
the Lower Mainland Local Government Association and/or working with other
municipalities to present at Union of BC Municipalities:

Council Meeting
Minutes, February 11, 2020 37
WHEREAS
On February 11, 2020, Vancouver City Council affirmed its commitment
to full and transparent reporting of financial contributions to elector
organizations and candidates, including full and transparent reporting by
third party entities that engage in significant campaign activities in support
of candidates or endorsed candidates, and that all financial transactions –
both during a campaign and outside of campaign periods – be reported,
including contributions toward operating accounts and operating
expenses, including those of third party entities used for campaign and
non-campaign political purposes and activities.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT the Union of BC Municipalities
request that the Province amend the Local Elections Campaign Financing
Act to require full and transparent reporting by provincial political parties
of in-kind support and financial contributions they make to municipal
election candidates in elections years, as well as to sitting elected officials
in non-election years.
E. THAT the Mayor write a letter to the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing
requesting the Province conduct a public review of the 2018 general local
elections to determine what future changes are needed to ensure British
Columbians get the fair elections they deserve.
ENQUIRIES AND OTHER MATTERS
1. Sidewalk Repairs in the West End
Councillor Carr requested information regarding the participatory budgeting project, repairing
sidewalks in the West End, and why the repair of sidewalks is not in a matter of due course part
of the Engineering budget. The City Manager noted sidewalks were added by the community as
part of the participatory budgeting process and not by the City. There are specific and rigid
criteria such as safety risks and condition that are taken into consideration whether or not a
sidewalk will be repaired. There is an annual budget for sidewalk repairs and the specific safety
criteria is applied city-wide to prioritize which sidewalks are to be repaired. The sidewalks in
question likely do not meet the city-wide safety criteria and ranked lower in priority for being
repaired.
2. Placement of Development Application Signage
Councillor Dominato requested information regarding placement of development application
signage. It was noted that some development application signage has been placed on rooftops
and there was concern they were not visible by pedestrians.
3. Updates from the City Auditor
Councilor Dominato requested information on practices of the City auditor providing updates at
the municipal level.
