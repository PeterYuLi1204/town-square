Following advice from the City Clerk, the Mayor ruled the amendment out of order as the Joint
Council on Childcare requires only one representative of Council. He noted representation could
be looked in the future to allow for another Council member to be appointed. As the motion had
not received a seconder, and was ruled out of order, it was not put.
