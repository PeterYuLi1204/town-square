COUNCIL MEMBERS’ MOTIONS
1. Adding Sikh Heritage Month to City of Vancouver's Official Observances
The Committee heard from six speakers in support of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
SECONDED by Councillor Zhou
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. Sikh Heritage Month is a month-long celebration in April highlighting the many
contributions that Sikh communities have made to Canada. Sikh Heritage Month
in Canada originated with the Legislative Assembly of Ontario proclaiming the
month in 2013 and later formalized with the Sikh Heritage Month Act in 2019,
recognizing the significant contributions of Sikh Canadians who first arrived in
Canada in 1906 and have been making incredible contributions to our country,
province and city ever since;
2. Sikh Heritage Month is the perfect opportunity to celebrate the history, culture
and traditions of Sikh communities in Canada, which are grounded in the values
of service and compassion. It is also the time to highlight the countless
achievements of Sikh people, whether in politics, business, the arts, medicine or
education;
3. The founder of Sikhism, Guru Nanak Dev Ji, is renowned for sharing values of
equality, humanity and unity throughout his life. In April, Sikh communities
celebrate Vaisakhi, which commemorates the founding of Sikhism and honours
the teachings and spiritual legacy of the ten Gurus which continue to inspire
millions of people around the world;
4. The City of Vancouver takes great pride in the rich heritage of our diverse
cultural, ethnic, racial and faith-based communities, and continues to work
towards a more inclusive city for everyone;
5. Throughout the City’s history the Sikh community has played and continues to
play a significant role in shaping the social, economic, and cultural landscapes of
Vancouver;
6. Sikh Heritage Month provides the opportunity for the City of Vancouver to
officially celebrate the rich traditions and heritage of the Sikh community and to
honour their lasting contributions to Vancouver.

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, May 7, 2025 6
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
THAT Council direct staff to add Sikh Heritage Month in April to the City of Vancouver’s
official observances calendar; and
FURTHER THAT the City of Vancouver will acknowledge this day with a proclamation as
is customary for the City’s official observances.
CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY (Vote No. 10684)
(Councillor Meiszner absent for the vote)
2. Prohibiting the Sale of Gun-Shaped-Lighters (GSL) and Calling on the Province to
Explore Legislation to Ban GSLs
MOVED by Councillor Klassen
SECONDED by Councillor Fry
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. Gun-Shaped Lighters (GSL) have proliferated in the City of Vancouver over the
past year, with an estimated 50-75 stores selling multiple GSLs, particularly in
the Downtown Eastside (DTES) and downtown core;
2. GSLs closely resemble real firearms, leading to public distress and a significant
increase in 9-1-1 emergency calls, with 162 police responses recorded in 2024;
3. Over 50% of these 9-1-1 calls were classified as priority weapons calls,
necessitating an elevated police response, including the deployment of multiple
officers, use of force options such as Conducted Energy Weapons (Tasers),
less-lethal beanbag shotguns, and ARWEN launchers;
4. The presence of GSLs in public spaces has resulted in multiple dangerous
encounters where police officers have had to draw their firearms, creating a risk
of fatal outcomes should a suspect fail to comply or appear to threaten officers or
the public;
5. There have been documented instances where GSLs were used in violent
crimes, including 6 cases involving violent offenses and 10 cases leading to
criminal charges such as robbery, assault, and weapons possession;
6. The concentration of GSL-related calls has been predominantly in high-density
urban areas, with 46% of the calls occurring in the DTES and 39% in downtown
Vancouver;
7. A significant allocation of police resources has been required to respond to these
incidents, with 32 calls necessitating the dispatch of 10 or more police units, and
an average of 2.5 hours needed to resolve each call;

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, May 7, 2025 7
8. The Criminal Code of Canada does not prohibit the possession or sale of GSLs
unless they are used in the commission of a crime, leaving law enforcement with
limited avenues to seize these items proactively;
9. There are currently no Federal, Provincial, or Municipal laws prohibiting the sale
or possession of GSLs, despite their clear risk to public safety and law
enforcement personnel; and
10. The frequency of GSL-related incidents has been increasing month-over-month
and occurring on a near-daily basis, further exacerbating safety concerns. A
proactive ban on the sale and distribution GSLs in the City of Vancouver through
a by-law or by-law amendment would serve to enhance public safety and reduce
the burden on law enforcement while other legislative measures are being
explored.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to provide recommendations regarding by-law
amendments to prohibit the sale of gun-shaped lighters in the City of Vancouver;
FURTHER THAT any proposed by-law amendments include enforcement
measures and penalties to ensure compliance (i.e., amendments to the
provisions and schedules of the Ticket Offences By-law No. 9360).
B. THAT Council request the Mayor to write a letter to the Province requesting
legislative measures to prohibit the sale, distribution, and possession of Gun-
Shaped Lighters (GSLs) in British Columbia, including consideration to amending
relevant legislation to empower law enforcement to seize GSLs proactively and
prevent their proliferation in communities across British Columbia.
CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY (Vote No. 10685)
(Councillor Meiszner absent for the vote)
3. Opportunity for a Cultural Precinct in the Heart of Downtown

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, May 7, 2025 8
MOVED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
SECONDED by Councillor Zhou
THAT the Committee recommend to Council

a. Ballet BC
b. Chor Leoni
c. City Opera Vancouver
d. Coastal Jazz and Blues Society
e. DanceHouse
f. Dancers of Damelahamid
g. Early Music Vancouver

w. Vancouver Symphony Orchestra
x. Vancouver Youth Choir
y. Vancouver Youth Symphony Orchestra
z. Vetta Chamber Music Society;
2. Individual music and performing arts organization space needs in Vancouver are
currently unmet and are difficult to achieve. But the power of the collective vision
transcends individual needs, and has the opportunity to create a lasting cultural
and economic legacy that will:
a. Revitalise the City and Downtown supporting a vibrant Vancouver with
the proposed Cultural Precinct;
b. Boost the economy by attracting talent, business and tourism;
c. Make Vancouver a performing arts destination;

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, May 7, 2025 9
d. Provide incredible experiences for residents supporting a fun and liveable
City;
3. The VCHTS has recently completed Phase I of its Cultural Precinct Feasibility
Study, which studied the needs of the Cultural Precinct Planning Committee
member organizations and determined that:
a. Vancouver has about half the number of performing arts seats of
comparable cities;
b. New and renovated facilities are needed, including a new 1800-2000 seat
hall and a new 450 seat flexible space hall;
4. Phase I considered three locations where the new hall might be built: Robson
Square, the Queen Elizabeth Theatre Plaza/ šxʷƛ̓exən Xwtl'a7shn, and in
cooperation with the Vancouver Art Gallery, at the proposed Larwill Park site;
5. Phase II (about 12 months) will analyse these locations; consider renovation
possibilities for existing halls; and identify the optimal site for the project to be
built and a projected timeline;
6. In 2013, Council approved the City entering into a Memorandum of
Understanding with the Vancouver Art Gallery Association (VAGA), committing in
principle to a 99-year nominal lease for approximately two-thirds of the
City-owned Larwill Park site to support the development of a new Vancouver Art
Gallery, subject to specific conditions. This MOU was reaffirmed by Council
multiple times including as recently as 2024;
7. The City-owned Larwill Park site slated to be the home of the new Vancouver Art
Gallery has unique potential to co-locate music and performing arts
organizations, assure a long-term future for the VCHTS member organizations,
and collectively provide a City building opportunity to create a Cultural Precinct
destination in the heart of Downtown Vancouver;
8. Music and arts organizations contribute to the quality and vibrancy of life in
Vancouver, are a platform to celebrate our shared and diverse cultures, and to
support our local economy;
9. Mixed use developments also contribute to a vibrant and healthy Downtown.
Consideration of housing on the Larwill Park site, in addition to commercial uses
currently enabled and required under area “C1” of the DDODP, could be a
positive component of a vibrant new mixed-use Cultural Precinct. Any cultural
spaces floor area stemming from a new Concert Hall and related cultural uses
would contribute to fulfilling the non-residential FSR requirement outlined in
current policy as would the inclusion of new hotels, while also supporting
addressing the hotel supply gap and complement cultural uses.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council acknowledge the engagement of City staff to date in assisting the
Vancouver Concert Hall and Theatre Society (VCHTS), direct staff to review

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, May 7, 2025 10
VCHTS’ Phase I Feasibility Report on receipt, and to continue working with the
Society on scoping and development of the Phase II of the Cultural Precinct
Feasibility Study, noting considerations such as but not necessarily limited to
alignment with City priorities, broad cultural infrastructure needs, high-level
costing and funding feasibility, and a functional programming plan.
B. THAT Council direct staff to work with Vancouver Concert Hall and Theatre
Society to explore the potential to locate a Cultural Precinct and two new concert
halls (as identified in Phase I of the Cultural Precinct Feasibility) on the
City-owned site at Larwill Park that would complement the envisioned new
Vancouver Art Gallery.
C. THAT Council encourages Vancouver Concert Hall and Theatre Society to share
the vision and work and engage with key stakeholders including the Musqueam,
Squamish and Tsleil-Waututh Nations and the Vancouver Art Gallery Association
to enable contribution to shaping the broader Cultural Precinct vision for the
Larwill Park site.

4. Sustainable School Food Funding
The Committee heard from six speakers in support of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Bligh
SECONDED by Councillor Fry
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. Vancouver's Healthy City Strategy emphasizes the importance of a healthy, just,
and sustainable food system, and aims to increase access to healthy, affordable
food for all residents;
2. Access to nutritious food is critical to the health, learning, and overall well-being
of school-aged children, with extensive research demonstrating links between
healthy school meals and improved academic outcomes, attendance, and equity;
3. Since 2015, due to the absence of a senior government funded school food
program, the City of Vancouver has provided funding to the (VSB) Vancouver
School Board’s school meal program, mainly its daily lunch program,
“Food4Schools” for students experiencing food insecurities;
4. Since 2020 in addition to advocating for the senior government to establish a
universal healthy food program, the City has provided $325,000 from the
Operating Budget in annual funding through to June 2025;
5. In July of 2024 anticipating substantial new Provincial investment through the
“Feeding Futures” Fund and federal funding through a National School Food
Program for VSB food programs, VSB were informed that the City’s 2025 budget
would sunset the City’s contribution to Food4Schools, concluding at the end of
the 2024/2025 school year;

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, May 7, 2025 14
6. In March 2025, the B.C. Government entered into an agreement with the
Government of Canada through the National School Food Program (NSFP),
providing approximately $39 million over three years in additional school food
program funding to complement Feeding Futures;
7. In April 2025, VSB learned the expected funding allocations would be
substantially reduced based on a provincial formula socioeconomic status index.
Needs assessments can inadvertently exclude some individuals who may not
meet strict eligibility criteria but still experience food insecurity. This can lead to
gaps in coverage and prevent the program from fully addressing the needs of the
community. In the case of Vancouver this represents a shortfall for the existing
needs of the Food4Schools program and VSB students experiencing food
insecurities.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to allocate resources from contingency to restore City
funding to VSB school food programs at a level consistent with prior support
($325,000 annually) for the 2025/26 school year and work with VSB staff to
determine steps to secure alternative funding to meet the needs of VSB students
experiencing food insecurities.
B. THAT Council restate support for a VSB led Universal Healthy School Food
Program to meet the needs of VSB students experiencing food insecurities;
FURTHER THAT the Mayor writes and advocates to senior government,
including the Minister of Education and Child Care, the Premier of British
Columbia, and Vancouver-area MLAs to communicate the City’s aligned position,
emphasize the urgent need for equitable, appropriate, and sustainable funding to
support VSB students facing food insecurity, and express concern regarding the
ongoing downloading of social services onto local governments.

AMENDMENT MOVED by Mayor Sim
SECONDED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
THAT the following be added to A as follows:
FURTHER THAT, to better understand and address the funding shortfall
impacting VSB’s school food program, and to support long-term, equitable
solutions for all Vancouver students experiencing food insecurity, Council:

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, May 7, 2025 15
a. Reaffirm the City’s strong support for a Universal Healthy School Food
Program.
b. Call on the Province to examine, address, and fully fund the VSB’s school
food funding gap, especially given the significant federal and provincial
dollars now available for school food programs;
c. Request a clear explanation from the Province and the Ministry of Education
and Child Care about how funding is distributed across BC’s 60 school
districts under the new national school food program, including how the
“socioeconomic status index” is calculated and applied and ensure that
Vancouver is receiving its fair share of federal funding.
FURTHER THAT the FURTHER THAT in B be struck and added to A and read as
follows:
AND FURTHER THAT Council request the Mayor writes and advocates to senior
government, including the Minister of Education and Child Care, the Premier of
British Columbia, and Vancouver-area MLAs to communicate the City’s aligned
position, emphasize the urgent need for equitable, appropriate, and sustainable
funding to support VSB students facing food insecurity, and express concern
regarding the ongoing downloading of social services onto local governments;
AND FURTHER THAT the THAT clause in B be struck and the following be inserted
as B:
B. THAT Council direct staff to engage with the Vancouver School Board to
clarify how school food program funding is being allocated and spent,
given that funding is now being received from all three levels of
government.
