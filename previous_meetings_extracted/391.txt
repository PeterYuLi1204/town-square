3. Flag Raising at City Hall to Recognize Black History Month in Vancouver in 2024
The City Manager responded to questions.
MOVED by Councillor Meiszner
SECONDED by Councillor Boyle
WHEREAS
1. Black History Month provides us with the opportunity to celebrate and learn about
the many achievements, investments, and contributions of Vancouver’s Black
and African diasporic communities, even while these communities have endured
historical and continuing inequality, oppression, and erasure in our city;
2. The City of Vancouver celebrates Black History Month by recognizing that
People of African descent have been a part of Canada since the early 1600’s
prior to the abolishment of slavery in 1834, and have been part of British
Columbia’s history since 1858;
3. The City of Vancouver recognizes that Black Canadians and African diaspora
communities continue to contribute to the vibrant cultural, economic, political, and
social development of the city and affirms the rights, and is striving to strengthen,
the full and equitable participation of people of African descent;
4. Vancouver is located on the unceded ancestral territories of the Musqueam,
Squamish and Tsleil-Waututh People, and the City therefore also recognizes the
historical relationship between Indigenous and Black Communities, and is
dedicated to support strengthening relations between Indigenous, Black, and
People of Mixed Heritage;
5. The UN General Assembly proclaimed 2015-2024 as the International Decade
for People of African Descent;
6. The City of Vancouver honours the legacy of Black Canadians, including such
notable persons as Emery Barnes, a trailblazer in politics as the first Black
member of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia, Barbara Howard, a
pioneering figure in Canadian sports and education, and Vie Moore, whose
Hogan’s Alley restaurant became a prominent cultural and community Vancouver
landmark, to name just a few who have significantly shaped this country and
paved the way for the leadership, creativity, determination, and future
imagination of Black Canadians, African Diaspora, and other racialized
communities, as well as all Canadians;
7. The City of Vancouver is working on an Anti-Black Racism Strategy, and has
signed an MOU with the Hogan’s Alley Society to establish the long term
involvement and investment of the Black Community in the future life of the 898
Main St. Block to address the intergenerational socio-economic impacts of
displacement, and the need for the continued input of the Black Community’s
perspective in the Northeast False Creek planning process and all our City
planning processes;

Council Meeting
Minutes, March 7, 2023 17
8. On January 31, 2023, Mayor Ken Sim officially proclaimed the month of February
2023 as “BLACK HISTORY MONTH” in the City of Vancouver;
9. 2024 will mark the end of the International Decade for People of African Descent.
It is therefore incumbent upon the City and the people of Vancouver to find new
and ongoing ways to mark and celebrated Black History Month;
10. Large flags are frequently raised on the north lawn of City Hall, and
standard-sized flags are flown at the flag island at 12th and Cambie. The City’s
Protocol Office frequently makes requests for flags to be raised on the flag island
for occasions such as Pride Week and National Indigenous History
Month/Peoples Day (at least 12 flags are required to cover the entire island).
Most recently, Ukrainian flags have been flown at the flag island to show our
city’s support for the Ukrainian people and our Sister City Odesa during this time
of war with Russia;
11. The City of Vancouver has specific policies and procedures for flying flags on
City buildings and structures. Under the City’s flag policies and procedures, the
City Clerk has the responsibility and authority for making decisions regarding the
flying of guest flags, half-masting, and any other discretionary matters; and
12. There are a number of flags that are specific to and/or connected with Black
History Month, as well as flags such as the Pan-African Flag – which is red, black
and green – that are emblematic of and/or reflective of Black and African
communities.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to engage with Vancouver’s
Black and African diasporic communities in 2023 to enable the raising of a suitable flag
or flags to be flown at Vancouver City Hall to mark Black History Month in 2024,
including specific consultation with the Black and African diasporic communities as to the
flag or flags that would be supported by the Black and African diasporic communities;
FURTHER THAT Council direct staff to report back before the end of Q3 of 2023 with
information gleaned from their engagement and consultations with the city’s Black and
African diasporic communities, including any recommendations for additional actions
required by Council.
