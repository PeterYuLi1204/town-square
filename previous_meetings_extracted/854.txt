6. Transparency and Accountability at Little Mountain
At the Council meeting on February 11, 2020, Council referred the above-noted motion to the
Standing Committee on Policy and Strategic Priorities meeting on February 12, 2020, in order to
hear from speakers.
The Committee heard from four speakers in support of the motion and one speaker with
concerns around the process being too time consuming and preventing it from moving forward.
MOVED by Councillor Boyle
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. Social housing was first built at Little Mountain in the 1950s;
2. Vancouver, British Columbia, and the Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation
(Canada) first signed an agreement in November 1950, which stipulated that all
social housing on the Little Mountain site must be replaced should the original
structures be demolished;
3. 224 units of social housing were built at Little Mountain and remained on the site
until 2009;

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, February 12, 2020 7
4. Residents at Little Mountain began being encouraged to relocate to other social
housing in March 2007. BC Housing assured residents that they would be able to
return to their new homes on the site by the time of the Olympics in 2010;
5. Many residents resisted moving and were supported by thousands of their
neighbours and other Vancouver residents;
6. The original residents recommended that the public land at Little Mountain not be
privatized. Residents recommended that instead of simply replacing the
demolished 224 units of social housing hundreds more social housing units
should be built, and that any redevelopment should be done in phases so that
residents could stay in their homes with the least amount of disruption;
7. All but 4 units on the site were demolished in November 2009;
8. As a result of the refusal of 4 residents to move, one building replacing only 53
units of the original 224 units of social housing was built, and today the rest of the
Little Mountain site is a large, 15 acre vacant lot;
9. In the twelve years since 2007 Vancouver has suffered through an intensifying
crisis of homelessness and unaffordable housing;
10. BC Housing entered into an agreement for the sale of the property with Holborn
Development Company in 2008, though the sale was apparently not finalized
until 2013, with two amendments to the 2013 contract since then;
11. The contract has not yet been made public. The original residents and other
members of the community have been asking to see the agreement for sale and
contract for twelve years. The City of Vancouver has previously requested to see
the contract but was not able to;
12. It is in the interest of Vancouver residents and the City of Vancouver that there
be transparency regarding the sale of this significant public asset. Disclosure of
the contract would provide new and relevant information to the public that
previously was unknown, serve the public’s interest in sound financial
management by government, and help determine whether the developer has
dealt fairly with the public;
13. Details that have emerged from recent Vancouver Sun investigative reporting
suggest that the terms of the sale favoured the purchaser in unusual ways,
including payment for the land being structured to extend over decades;
14. The loss of the then existing social housing has created, among many Vancouver
residents, cynicism and loss of confidence in the public process;
15. Application has been made through BC Freedom of Information Legislation for
disclosure of the contract between BC Housing and Holborn Developments
(OIPC File No.: F18-75849 & F18-76353 –– Public Body File No.: 292-30- 3418)
This FOI application will be adjudicated in the coming weeks.

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, February 12, 2020 8
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT in the interest of full transparency and providing
information instructive to the City of Vancouver in future developments, Council express
its support for the Freedom of Information application, and direct the Mayor to write a
letter to the Riley Park South Cambie Visions Committee indicating support for full
disclosure of the contract.

FURTHER THAT this letter will also express the City of Vancouver’s ongoing
commitment to work with B.C. Housing and the landowner to increase affordable
housing in the city of Vancouver.
FURTHER THAT the following be added as C:
THAT Council direct staff to continue to explore all resources available and
appropriate, including new City of Vancouver and B.C. Housing policies that may
be offered subsequent to this decision of Council, to expedite the delivery of 69
space child care facility and the 282 units of social housing onsite in the interest
of welcoming back the people who wish to return to the Little Mountain Housing
Site.

7. Including Pedestrians in Vancouver’s Snow Protocol and Response
At the Council meeting on February 11, 2020, due to time constraints, Council referred the
above-noted motion to the Standing Committee on Policy and Strategic Priorities meeting on
February 12, 2020.
At 2:38 pm, during clarifying questions towards the Council member moving the above-noted
motion, Councillor De Genova rose on a point of order, per Section 6.1(b) of the Procedure
By-law, noting that “a Council member must not by words, express any opinion or make any
allegation that directly or indirectly reflects negatively upon the character or any person or group
of persons.” The Chair ruled in favour of Councillor De Genova’s point of order.
Subsequently, Councillor Fry challenged the ruling of the Chair.

Minutes, Wednesday, February 12, 2020 11
MOVED by Councillor Fry
THAT the Chair’s ruling be appealed.
LOST (Vote No. 05530)
(Councillors Bligh, Carr, De Genova, Dominato, Hardwick, Kirby-Yung and Wiebe opposed)
(Councillors Boyle and Swanson abstained from the vote)
A two-thirds majority of Council members present is required to overrule the ruling of the Chair;
the Chair’s ruling was sustained.
The Committee heard from one speaker in support of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. Keeping our city’s streets, sidewalks, and green spaces safe and clean for
everyone to enjoy is a City of Vancouver priority, including the clearing of snow
from streets and public sidewalks;
2. Ensuring that people of all ages and abilities can access homes, businesses, and
facilities in safety and comfort, especially those who are walking, cycling, or
taking transit, is a chief goal of the City’s Complete Streets Strategy and
fundamental to the City’s core responsibility of building and maintaining the city’s
roads, sidewalks, and public spaces, managing how city streets are used, and
creating land use and urban design policies;
3. When sidewalks are not cleared during snow and ice events it can negatively and
severely impact some of Vancouver’s most vulnerable persons, including seniors
and persons with disabilities, and can leave them isolated and/or unsafe;
4. Sidewalks that are not cleared of snow and ice often have the greatest negative
impact on those who can least afford to stay home, such as hourly and contract
workers who either need to walk and/or safely reach transit, which is
fundamentally inconsistent with the City’s Equity goals;
5. The Climate Emergency Response report approved by Council on April 29, 2019,
contains six big moves to reduce Vancouver’s carbon pollution, wherein the first
two “big moves” are “Walkable complete communities” (i.e. by 2030, 90% of
people live within an easy walk and roll of their daily needs) and “Safe and
convenient active transportation and transit” (i.e. by 2030, two thirds of trips in
Vancouver will be by active transportation and transit);
6. Transportation decisions in the City of Vancouver generally reflect a “hierarchy of
modes” for moving people which prioritize walking as the highest transportation
priority, then cycling, then transit, followed by taxi / commercial / shared vehicles,
and lastly private automobiles;

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, February 12, 2020 12
7. The responsibility for clearing roads and travelways in the City of Vancouver falls
to the Engineering Department and Streets Division. When cold weather hits, the
City works to ensure that major routes are safe by salting and brining before any
snow or freezing rain starts, and plowing once snow falls;
8. The City of Vancouver has over 100 pieces of snow equipment, including salters,
plows, and specialized equipment to clear bike lanes, as well as 200 trained staff
and the ability to manufacture brine at its National Yard to deal with winter
conditions including snow and ice;
9. Although the City of Vancouver has snow and ice removal equipment designed
for clearing roads, as well as specialized snow and ice removal equipment for
clearing bike routes, the City lacks sufficient or appropriate equipment specifically
designed to clear sidewalks and high priority pedestrian areas of the city even
though walking is the highest priority mode in the City’s transportation hierarchy
and central to the City’s Climate Emergency Response;
10. The City’s current priority locations for snow and ice removal in Vancouver’s
snow response protocol are:
• Major roads
• Bus routes
• Bridges
• Emergency access routes (including five major hospitals and two health care
facilities)
• School routes
• 15 most-used bike routes
• Bus stops
• Arterial corner ramps;
11. It has been widely observed that although the City clears snow and ice from the
city’s 15 most-used bike routes on a priority basis, the city’s parallel pedestrian
walking paths are not cleared with the same or greater degree of priority;
12. It is commonly accepted that the Lower Mainland / Metro Vancouver region can
expect to experience snow and ice conditions during any given year (with some
years being mercifully and relatively free of snow and ice). Historically for
example:
• Snow and ice conditions from December 2016 to January 2017 represented
the third time in eight years the City of Vancouver experienced extreme cold
weather and was seemingly caught unprepared for such a weather event;
• At the January 15, 2013 Regular Council Meeting, in response to the
December 2012 snow and ice conditions in Vancouver, a motion introduced
by Councillor Affleck entitled “Snow Removal Plan” carried unanimously; and
• At the December 3, 2009 Standing Committee on City Services and Budgets,
in response to a motion introduced by Councillor Woodsworth, Council
received a staff report relating to the extreme winter conditions experienced

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, February 12, 2020 13
from December 13, 2008 to January 8, 2009. The 2009 report notes many of
the same concerns the city continues to experience during snow and ice
events today, including concern for persons who are vulnerable to becoming
homebound and negatively impacted in terms of routine access to food,
medicine and other necessities;
13. Snow and ice conditions across Metro Vancouver can vary widely, as do the
urban/suburban characteristics of each constituent municipality, leading to
corresponding differences in each municipality’s snow and ice response plans,
actions and priorities. For example, communities on the North Shore of Burrard
Inlet such as North and West Vancouver and Coquitlam are more mountainous
than Vancouver, while the City of Richmond (which averages just one metre
above sea level) only found it necessary to include single-family residences in its
by-law covering sidewalk snow and ice removal quite recently in 2017
(By-law 5870);
14. On a national scale, where snow and ice are a bigger part of civic life during
winter than in Metro Vancouver, and in terms of clearing snow and ice from
sidewalks and high priority pedestrian areas, the City of Toronto, for example,
has 600 snow plows, 300 sidewalk plows, 200 salt trucks, and 1,500 personnel
ready to tackle winter conditions 24 hours per day and 7 days per week. The City
of Toronto spends about $90 million annually to deliver its winter operations
program, which includes a Sidewalk Plowing Program that clears about 6,400 km
of Toronto’s 7,900 km of sidewalk including high pedestrian volume sidewalks on
arterial roads, transit routes, near school zones, and around accessibility
locations (Note: the service does not include the clearing of snow from driveways
or private sidewalks leading to a residence);
15. The Engineering Department addresses snow events in two stages; Snow
Readiness and Snow Response. The 2019/2020 budget for snow readiness is
$1.6 million and supports advance preparation for the winter season to ensure
our city is well equipped to deal with extreme snow events. Snow response
occurs only during a snow event and the amount spent depends on the
magnitude of the event and response required. The City of Vancouver’s budget
includes an annual Council Contingency for such events of $2 million; snow
response is charged against this contingency. In the 2019 budget, Council
reduced the contingency from $4 million to $2 million. Recognizing the more
frequent occurrence of snow and storm events, for the 2020 budget staff
recommended $2 million for the snow response contingency reserve. However,
Council reduced the amount to $1 million;
16. The maintenance and cleanliness of roads and sidewalks, including extreme
weather response and dealing with snow and ice, are among the core, most
basic jurisdictional responsibilities of local governments such as the City of
Vancouver. It is therefore incumbent upon the City and Council to remain open at
all times to new and better ways to adapt to conditions and to meet the evolving
needs and expectations of the city’s residents, visitors, and businesses.

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, February 12, 2020 14
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to identify High Priority Pedestrian Areas and
Sidewalks in the city and report back by May, 2020, with information and
recommendations for incorporating these areas and sidewalks into the City’s
Snow Protocol and Response Strategy, in accordance with the topmost priority
accorded to walking in the City’s hierarchy of transportation modes, the City’s
Complete Streets Strategy, Equity goals, and Climate Emergency Response
actions and objectives.
B. THAT Council direct staff to include information in the report back outlining the
City’s responsibilities and obligations with respect to identified High Priority

FINAL MOTION AS APPROVED
WHEREAS
1. Keeping our city’s streets, sidewalks, and green spaces safe and clean for
everyone to enjoy is a City of Vancouver priority, including the clearing of snow
from streets and public sidewalks;
2. Ensuring that people of all ages and abilities can access homes, businesses, and
facilities in safety and comfort, especially those who are walking, cycling, or
taking transit, is a chief goal of the City’s Complete Streets Strategy and
fundamental to the City’s core responsibility of building and maintaining the city’s
roads, sidewalks, and public spaces, managing how city streets are used, and
creating land use and urban design policies;

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, February 12, 2020 16
3. When sidewalks are not cleared during snow and ice events it can negatively and
severely impact some of Vancouver’s most vulnerable persons, including seniors
and persons with disabilities, and can leave them isolated and/or unsafe;
4. Sidewalks that are not cleared of snow and ice often have the greatest negative
impact on those who can least afford to stay home, such as hourly and contract
workers who either need to walk and/or safely reach transit, which is
fundamentally inconsistent with the City’s Equity goals;
5. The Climate Emergency Response report approved by Council on April 29, 2019,
contains six big moves to reduce Vancouver’s carbon pollution, wherein the first
two “big moves” are “Walkable complete communities” (i.e. by 2030, 90% of
people live within an easy walk and roll of their daily needs) and “Safe and
convenient active transportation and transit” (i.e. by 2030, two thirds of trips in
Vancouver will be by active transportation and transit);
6. Transportation decisions in the City of Vancouver generally reflect a “hierarchy of
modes” for moving people which prioritize walking as the highest transportation
priority, then cycling, then transit, followed by taxi / commercial / shared vehicles,
and lastly private automobiles;
7. The responsibility for clearing roads and travelways in the City of Vancouver falls
to the Engineering Department and Streets Division. When cold weather hits, the
City works to ensure that major routes are safe by salting and brining before any
snow or freezing rain starts, and plowing once snow falls;
8. The City of Vancouver has over 100 pieces of snow equipment, including salters,
plows, and specialized equipment to clear bike lanes, as well as 200 trained staff
and the ability to manufacture brine at its National Yard to deal with winter
conditions including snow and ice;
9. Although the City of Vancouver has snow and ice removal equipment designed
for clearing roads, as well as specialized snow and ice removal equipment for
clearing bike routes, the City lacks sufficient or appropriate equipment specifically
designed to clear sidewalks and high priority pedestrian areas of the city even
though walking is the highest priority mode in the City’s transportation hierarchy
and central to the City’s Climate Emergency Response;
10. The City’s current priority locations for snow and ice removal in Vancouver’s
snow response protocol are:
• Major roads
• Bus routes
• Bridges
• Emergency access routes (including five major hospitals and two health care
facilities)
• School routes
• 15 most-used bike routes
• Bus stops
• Arterial corner ramps;

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, February 12, 2020 17
11. It has been widely observed that although the City clears snow and ice from the
city’s 15 most-used bike routes on a priority basis, the city’s parallel pedestrian
walking paths are not cleared with the same or greater degree of priority;
12. It is commonly accepted that the Lower Mainland / Metro Vancouver region can
expect to experience snow and ice conditions during any given year (with some
years being mercifully and relatively free of snow and ice). Historically for
example:
• Snow and ice conditions from December 2016 to January 2017 represented
the third time in eight years the City of Vancouver experienced extreme cold
weather and was seemingly caught unprepared for such a weather event;
• At the January 15, 2013 Regular Council Meeting, in response to the
December 2012 snow and ice conditions in Vancouver, a motion introduced
by Councillor Affleck entitled “Snow Removal Plan” carried unanimously; and
• At the December 3, 2009 Standing Committee on City Services and Budgets,
in response to a motion introduced by Councillor Woodsworth, Council
received a staff report relating to the extreme winter conditions experienced
from December 13, 2008 to January 8, 2009. The 2009 report notes many of
the same concerns the city continues to experience during snow and ice
events today, including concern for persons who are vulnerable to becoming
homebound and negatively impacted in terms of routine access to food,
medicine and other necessities;
13. Snow and ice conditions across Metro Vancouver can vary widely, as do the
urban/suburban characteristics of each constituent municipality, leading to
corresponding differences in each municipality’s snow and ice response plans,
actions and priorities. For example, communities on the North Shore of Burrard
Inlet such as North and West Vancouver and Coquitlam are more mountainous
than Vancouver, while the City of Richmond (which averages just one metre
above sea level) only found it necessary to include single-family residences in its
by-law covering sidewalk snow and ice removal quite recently in 2017
(By-law 5870);
14. On a national scale, where snow and ice are a bigger part of civic life during
winter than in Metro Vancouver, and in terms of clearing snow and ice from
sidewalks and high priority pedestrian areas, the City of Toronto, for example,
has 600 snow plows, 300 sidewalk plows, 200 salt trucks, and 1,500 personnel
ready to tackle winter conditions 24 hours per day and 7 days per week. The City
of Toronto spends about $90 million annually to deliver its winter operations
program, which includes a Sidewalk Plowing Program that clears about 6,400 km
of Toronto’s 7,900 km of sidewalk including high pedestrian volume sidewalks on
arterial roads, transit routes, near school zones, and around accessibility
locations (Note: the service does not include the clearing of snow from driveways
or private sidewalks leading to a residence);
15. The Engineering Department addresses snow events in two stages; Snow
Readiness and Snow Response. The 2019/2020 budget for snow readiness is
$1.6 million and supports advance preparation for the winter season to ensure

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, February 12, 2020 18
our city is well equipped to deal with extreme snow events. Snow response
occurs only during a snow event and the amount spent depends on the
magnitude of the event and response required. The City of Vancouver’s budget
includes an annual Council Contingency for such events of $2 million; snow
response is charged against this contingency. In the 2019 budget, Council
reduced the contingency from $4 million to $2 million. Recognizing the more
frequent occurrence of snow and storm events, for the 2020 budget staff
recommended $2 million for the snow response contingency reserve. However,
Council reduced the amount to $1 million;
16. The maintenance and cleanliness of roads and sidewalks, including extreme
weather response and dealing with snow and ice, are among the core, most
basic jurisdictional responsibilities of local governments such as the City of
Vancouver. It is therefore incumbent upon the City and Council to remain open at
all times to new and better ways to adapt to conditions and to meet the evolving
needs and expectations of the city’s residents, visitors, and businesses.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to identify High Priority Pedestrian Areas and
Sidewalks in the city and report back before Council’s summer break, with
information and recommendations for incorporating these areas and sidewalks
into the City’s Snow Protocol and Response Strategy, in accordance with the
topmost priority accorded to walking in the City’s hierarchy of transportation
modes, the City’s Complete Streets Strategy, Equity goals, and Climate
Emergency Response actions and objectives;
FURTHER THAT staff engage with the Seniors’ Advisory Committee as well as
the Persons with Disabilities Advisory Committee as well as any others deemed
beneficial, for their feedback and input.
B. THAT Council direct staff to include information in the report back outlining the
City’s responsibilities and obligations with respect to identified High Priority
Pedestrian Areas and Sidewalks, along with the respective responsibilities and
obligations of adjacent private property owners and/or their representative
agencies (such as BIAs and other jurisdictions such as TransLink).
C. THAT Council direct staff to consult with the Vancouver Board of Parks and
Recreation with respect to equipment and strategies employed by the Park Board
for clearing snow and ice from walkways and pathways under their jurisdiction
and to include this information in the report back to Council, including information
relating to operational efficiencies that could potentially be achieved by
partnering with the Park Board to clear snow and ice from appropriate High
Priority Pedestrian Areas and Sidewalks.
D. THAT Council direct staff to investigate, and include in the report back
information relating to opportunities to enhance the City’s snow and ice removal
equipment fleet through the acquisition of snow removal equipment specifically
designed or retrofitted for clearing sidewalks and high priority pedestrian areas of
the city in an efficient and cost-effective manner, including equipment that could
serve the dual function of clearing pedestrian pathways and bike lanes;

Minutes, Wednesday, February 12, 2020 19
FURTHER THAT consideration be given to acquiring this equipment under the
City’s current 2020 budget or upcoming 2021 budget in order for the equipment
to be available in time for any snow events during the 2020/2021 winter season.
E. THAT Council ask staff to report back on how social enterprise can be introduced
into the City’s acute snow removal protocol.

above-noted motion to the Standing Committee on Policy and Strategic Priorities meeting on

WHEREAS
1. On October 23, 2018, at the Standing Committee on City Finance and Services,
Council unanimously voted in favour of a motion calling for the establishment of
an Independent Auditor General Office for the City of Vancouver;
2. Paragraph B of Council’s October 23, 2018 resolution (“Prior Resolution B”)
calls for the formation of a sub-committee of Council to direct the establishment
and implementation of an Independent Auditor General Office for the City of

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, February 12, 2020 20
Vancouver, including “directing the search for and appointment of an Auditor
General, in consultation with, and based upon recommendations from such
bodies as the Canadian Audit and Accountability Foundation (CAAF) as well as
other relevant authorities that Council may deem appropriate (e.g., consultation
with BC’s Auditor General for Local Government, offices of Auditors General
across Canada, etc.), and with support as required from the office of the City
Manager or designate.”;
3. In order to implement Prior Resolution B, Council has three main options as
follows:
a) implementation of a formal empowered sub-committee of Council
(requiring a 2/3's vote of Council pursuant to Section 161 of the
Vancouver Charter); or
b) a formal (but not empowered) committee (but only requiring a simple
majority vote) pursuant to Section 159 of the Vancouver Charter); or
c) an informal working group not intended to constitute a committee (as
was done for the Budget Committee);
4. On December 17, 2019, Council approved the City’s 2020 Budget, including
Paragraph P which directed that “$500,000 be reserved and allocated from the
Operating Budget or existent $750,000 remainder from the 2019 “Innovation
Fund”, toward the establishment of an Auditor General’s Office in 2020.”;
5. The City of Vancouver is a member of the Canadian Audit and Accountability
Foundation, a not-for-profit organization dedicated to promoting and
strengthening public sector performance audit, oversight, and accountability in
Canada and abroad through research, education, and knowledge sharing;
6. The Canadian Audit and Accountability Foundation, as Canada’s premier audit
research and education foundation, has worked since 1980, with the support of
its members and stakeholders, to assist all parties to the accountability
relationship (i.e., oversight bodies, management, and the auditors who serve the
accountability relationship) to improve the performance and accountability of
public bodies, with resources, tools, and training to carry out their respective
responsibilities, and by providing a national focal point for knowledge sharing
and networking that fosters Canada-wide collaboration and discussion on issues
of mutual interest.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT the sub-committee of Council referenced in Prior Resolution B be created
pursuant to Section 159 of the Vancouver Charter, and that its members be
Councillors Bligh, Wiebe, and Hardwick (all of whom have indicated their
willingness to serve on the sub-committee) and that it be called the “Municipal
Auditor General Sub-Committee”.
B. THAT the Terms of Reference for the Municipal Auditor General Sub-Committee
be as follows:

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
