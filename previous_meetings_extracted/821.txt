COMMUNICATIONS
1. 2020 LMLGA Submission Adjustments
THAT Council approve the following proposed amendments to the resolution entitled
“Re-Examining Municipal pension Plan Divestment”, as submitted by the City of
Vancouver for consideration at the (2020) LMLGA and UBCM annual conferences:
Whereas since 2016, when the UBCM report, Primer on Fossil Fuel Divestment
and the Municipal Pension Plan noted that “Divestment may compromise our
investment strategy, increase risks and costs, and negatively affect our clients’
investment returns”, there have been major shifts in global climate science and
investment strategies;. The October 2018 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC) report verified that global warming is accelerating, with a window
of little more than a decade to drastically reduce Greenhouse Gas emissions to
avert catastrophic climate change impacts. Since 2016, divestment has
accelerated. In 2014, global funds committed to fossil fuel divestment was $52
billion. In 2018: $8 trillion. In 2019: $11 trillion, including pension funds such as
Caisse, Quebec, Quebec’s equivalent to B.C.’s pension fund manager, whose
CEO stated: “There are going to be stranded assets associated with climate
change…we think it’s good risk management to, over time, exit those”;
And whereas evidence is growing that fossil fuel-free funds are outperforming
fossil fuel investments. The 2019 return on the BC Government Employees
Union’s fossil fuel-free investments, for example, was 21.7 percent:
Therefore be it resolved that UBCM re-examine and update its 2016 Primer on
Fossil Fuel Divestment and the Municipal Pension Plan report in light of globally
changing investment and divestment strategies and inform BC Investment
Management Corporation, as the provider of investment management services
for BC’s Municipal Pension Plan, of the concerns of the UBCM regarding the
growing financial risks related to investing in fossil fuels and its support for a
plan, built on leading practices related to fossil fuel-free investment portfolios, to
fully divest Municipal Pension Plan funds from fossil fuels.

to close or severely limit operations due to health and physical distancing
restrictions;
2. Restaurants have been one of the most immediate and hardest hit sectors, and
small business operators are struggling to survive with many limited to takeout
offerings and attempting to make it through the pandemic;
3. Small businesses like restaurants are vital to the fabric and character of
Vancouver neighbourhoods and support complete communities;
4. Small businesses like restaurants are key contributors to Vancouver’s economic
health generating jobs and tax revenue;
5. The City has a key role to play in supporting economic recovery. Speed flexibility
and nimbleness in permitting and business support services will be instrumental
to helping businesses get back up and running and survive;
6. Patio season is a critical revenue generator for restaurants and is upon us now.
Expedited patio permitting must be turnkey when restaurants are able to reopen
to table type service;
7. Some work has begun with staff offering online renewals for patio permits during
the COVID-19 crisis;
8. An outcome of COVID will likely be the need for some continued physical
distancing processes in businesses. Customers will also be cautious about being
in close quarters to others;
9. Patios provide the health benefit of fresh air and sunlight;
10. There is opportunity to be innovative and redefine patios such as pop-up
standing patios for quick service type offerings, expanded size to enable physical
distancing, or utilization of curb lane, street, sidewalk and laneway space for
extensions where it doesn’t impede accessibility, transit, emergency vehicles or
traffic;
11. Currently, patio permitting can require a combination of licensing, development
permits and permits to enable operations;

Council Meeting
Minutes, May 12, 2020 16
12. Currently, craft breweries are not permitted to have patio operations in
Vancouver;
13. The City of Vancouver has initiated a street reallocation response that focuses on
Room to Queue, Room to Load, and Room to Move during the COVID-19
pandemic. There is opportunity to add Room to Eat to this work, and to re-
examine public space use as part of a new post-pandemic world; and
14. Many cities are re-examining the use of public space now to achieve healthier
communities. A COVID legacy can be a more vibrant and people focused public
realm.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to prepare options and report back as soon as possible
to support more flexible patio types (including consideration for pre-detailed
designs and formats), utilization of curb lane, street, sidewalk and laneway space
for extensions, expedited permitting including applications and renewals, as well
as the number of patios allowed, in order to support the economic recovery and
safe operations of Vancouver’s restaurant sector in the context of COVID-19.
B. THAT such options identify any needed amendments to Street Vending
By-law No. 10868 and the Street and Traffic By-law No. 2849 to enable greater
flexibility.
C. THAT breweries that currently hold a lounge endorsement within the City of
Vancouver may apply for patio endorsements, aligning with the
recommendations and guidelines set out by the Provincial government, and that
brewery patio applications will be considered as long as the total patron load
including the new patio remains below the current City patron limit for ancillary
brewery lounges. Considerations for brewery lounge patios should adhere to
similar licensing and permitting fees as restaurants and cafes.
D. THAT such options be considered for the duration of the COVID-19 response
and recovery, recognizing that innovation will provide for valuable learning
towards operations and adaptation in a new, post-COVID world;
FURTHER THAT staff report back on possible opportunities to create commons-
style eating spaces with additional chairs, benches or tables on public plazas or
public spaces, that can enable outdoor eating areas to support different takeout
or quick service restaurants and cafes in various neighbourhoods and
commercial districts, with consultation with impacted business improvement
associations as may be appropriate (recognizing previous Council motions such
as Celebrating Italian Culture: Welcome Signage in Little Italy and a Pilot
Program for an Italian Piazza in Vancouver as it relates to Commercial Drive).

3. Working for More Housing Affordability in the Cambie Corridor
MOVED by Councillor Swanson
SECONDED by Councillor Wiebe
WHEREAS
1. The public benefits summary for the rezoning application at 4989 Ash Street
points out that a total of 10,740 housing units are complete, under construction,
approved or in review in the Cambie Corridor;
2. The summary shows that 71% are condos serving households with incomes
mostly over $100K per year;
3. The summary shows that 20% are purpose built rental serving households with
incomes mostly over $60K per year;
4. The summary shows that 9% or 947 units are social housing;
5. Of the 947 units that are social housing, only 30% or 284 units have to be at
HILS (about $50-80K/year);
6. That means only 3% of the total number of units have to be at HILS even though
50% of renters and 26% of owners in Vancouver have incomes below HILS;
7. The Cambie Corridor Plan says (p. 21) that one purpose of the plan is to “ensure
that objectives for affordable housing meet the needs of households with low
incomes, seniors, and those with mental illnesses and addictions.”; and
8. The housing mix that is playing out in the Corridor is skewed toward people who
have more than average income and is excluding low wage workers, seniors,
people with low incomes, people with disabilities and people who are homeless.

Council Meeting
Minutes, May 12, 2020 18
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council ask staff to revisit and report back as
part of their ongoing work on the affordability of Cambie Corridor Plan housing and
public benefit targets, taking into account that the new units that are built, under
construction, approved or under review, will not meet the Plan’s goals for affordability, as
only 3% of them are required to be at HILS rates (approximately $50-80K), while half of
renter households in the city as well as 26% of owner households have incomes below
$50K, and make recommendations for aligning the affordability targets to the real
incomes of people in Vancouver who need housing including low wage workers, people
who have low incomes, seniors, people with disabilities and people who are homeless.

MOVED by Councillor Dominato
SECONDED by Councillor Wiebe
WHEREAS
1. The City of Vancouver declared a local state of emergency on March 19, 2020, in
response to the global COVID-19 pandemic;
2. The Province has recommended physical distancing of 2 metres (6 feet) to
prevent the spread of COVID-19;
3. The Province has also recommended the public continue to safely enjoy the
outdoors, including local parks and public spaces;
4. The Provincial health officer has commented publicly in recent weeks that partial
street closures and one way travel/routing can be an effective way to enable
physical exercise and safe distancing during the pandemic;
5. Cities across Canada and around the world are undertaking measures to
reallocate street space and roadways for pedestrians to safely exercise, access

businesses and employment, while maintaining a safe distance due to the
current pandemic;
6. Vancouver City Council has previously endorsed motions to support slower
residential streets and encourage safer shared use;
7. The City of Vancouver and Park Board recently identified congestion in and
around Stanley Park, and subsequently closed the Stanley Park roadway to cars
and one lane along Beach Avenue to enable safe physical distancing during the
COVID19 pandemic;
8. The City of Vancouver has initiated a street reallocation initiative that focuses on
Room to Queue, Room to Load, and Room to Move during the COVID-19
pandemic; and
9. The ongoing pandemic necessitates that the City reallocate road space on an
urgent basis now and develop plans for mobility and space use as part of our
post-COVID-19 recovery and new economy.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to expedite efforts to identify
and implement appropriate reallocations of road space, such as high use greenways and
streets adjacent to parks where space could be reallocated temporarily to enable safe
shared use (pedestrians, cyclists, motor vehicles) and support safe physical distancing
during the COVID-19 pandemic response;
FURTHER THAT Council direct staff to communicate information to the public and
businesses regarding the suite of street measures available to the City for reallocating
space to support access to local businesses, to support loading and curbside pick-up,
and to support physical activity and distancing in neighbourhoods across the city;
AND FURTHER THAT Council direct staff to report back to Council in fall 2020 on
refined options for mobility and public realm use us as part of the post COVID-19
recovery and new economy.

Development Approval Process Review over 2018 and 2019 with UBCM officials,
local government officials and staff, developers and homebuilders, non-profit
housing representatives, community neighbourhood representatives and

7. Recalibrating the Housing Vancouver Strategy post COVID-19
MOVED by Councillor Hardwick
SECONDED by Councillor Bligh
WHEREAS
1. The City of Vancouver needs to make the right decisions going forward to create
the housing we need in the period following the COVID-19 pandemic;
2. The Housing Vancouver Strategy (HVS) was passed by the previous City Council
in 20171;
1 https://council.vancouver.ca/20171128/documents/rr1.pdf

Council Meeting
Minutes, May 12, 2020 22
3. The Housing Vancouver Strategy’s goal is 72,000 new homes across Vancouver
in the next 10 years (between 2018 and 2027)2;
4. Population growth has been consistent at approximately 1% per annum over the
past 20 years according to Statistics Canada census data. Based on this
historical trend, a similar growth rate for the coming decade would amount to a
population increase of around 66,000. In the City of Vancouver, the average
household size is 2.2 individuals per dwelling unit (or “home”)3;
5. The target of 72,000 new homes across Vancouver in the next 10 years
multiplied by 2.2 would mean a population increase of 158,400 - more than twice
the historical rate. A projected historical rate of population growth would imply
instead a need for roughly 30,000 new housing units over the coming decade;
6. Population growth has generally come through immigration as opposed to
domestic migration. While the federal government has increased immigration
targets by around 20 percent since 2017, there is evidence that immigration will
slow in upcoming years due to the pandemic. Even the increased rate of
immigration, though, could not justify the large disparity between historical rates
of population growth and the HVS targets;
7. Demand for different housing types may shift as a result of the post-pandemic
realities. In order to plan effectively, it will be necessary to obtain more detailed
data regarding the pipeline of development that has been underway since the
approval of the Housing Vancouver Strategy; and
8. A revised and more accurate understanding of demographic needs and demand
will assist in properly planning for the post COVID-19 reality. Setting excessively
high targets will pressure the City of Vancouver to grant significant amounts of
density at a low price, in an attempt to induce housing construction approaching
the HVS targets. This will cost the City of Vancouver potential revenue, and will
mean that the City abandons its commitment to having growth pay for itself.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to revisit the Housing Vancouver Strategy targets to
align with historical and projected population growth based on census data.
B. THAT Council direct staff to provide annual historical data since 2000 on the
number of units approved through rezoning, the breakdown of housing types that
have been approved, housing starts and net housing completions, and estimated
zoned capacity for the City of Vancouver.

Minutes, May 12, 2020 23
C. THAT Council direct staff to confirm that annual targets provide only a rough
estimate for growth, and not a strict requirement - i.e. targets do not need to be
met every year.
D. THAT Council direct staff to clarify whether the Vancouver Housing Strategy
targets refer to net housing completions or gross housing completions.
E. THAT Council direct staff to provide detailed inventory data through the Open
Data Portal4 of housing starts, development projects anticipated in the pipeline
(including form and type of units), and existing zoned capacity (disaggregated by
local area) to inform this work.
F. THAT Council direct staff to report back on the above for Council consideration
