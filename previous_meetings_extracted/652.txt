CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY
4. Incorporating a Bike Safety Index into Urban and Active Transportation Planning
MOVED by Councillor Fry
SECONDED by Councillor Carr
WHEREAS
1. Through Transportation 2040, the Climate Emergency Action Plan, and Healthy
City strategies, the City of Vancouver has the committed goal: to encourage and
support walking, cycling, and rolling so that 2/3 of all trips are made by walk,
bike, and transit by 2030;
2. Two common and popular metrics used to map attractiveness of urban locations
are Walk Score 1 and Bike Score 2. These rating systems are used by planners,
researchers, real-estate agents and prospective residents to indicate how
conducive an area is to walking or biking, on a scale of 0-100;
3. While Walk Score is determined by number and proximity of destinations or
amenities within one mile, Bike Score methodology additionally contemplates
bike lanes and road connectivity, bike commuting mode share, hills and grade;
4. In a newly published study, Determining If Walkability and Bikeability Indices
Reflect Pedestrian and Cyclist Safety 3, principal investigator Tarek Sayed, UBC
civil engineering professor and Canada Research Chair in transportation safety
and advanced mobility, writes: “Among the public, there is an implicit assumption
that ‘walkable’ and ’bikeable’ means safe for walking and biking, but these
indices do not actually include objective measures of safety”;4
5. The study, comparing walk score and bike score with pedestrian-motor-vehicle
and cyclist-motor-vehicle crashes in Vancouver, compiled 134 traffic analysis
zones using 5 years of ICBC crash data with walking, cycling, and motor-vehicle
traffic volume controls for exposure to indicate that areas of the city with higher
walkability and bikeability can be potentially associated with greater pedestrian

Council Meeting
Minutes, April 27, 2021 14
and cyclist crash risk, respectively, even after controlling for exposure;
6. Areas of the city found to pose the highest collision risk to pedestrians included
the downtown core, Fairview, Mount Pleasant, Strathcona and Grandview-
Woodland, which all have high Walk Scores. Areas of the city found to pose the
highest collision risk to cyclists included zones in the downtown core and in
Strathcona and Mount Pleasant, which are all rated highly on the Bike Score
index;
7. Neighborhood walkability and bikeability scores do not indicate safety for
pedestrians and cyclists, and could be modified to better incorporate objective
risk; and
8. New, improved methods of transportation safety, risk, and attractiveness analysis
and evaluation like those being developed at UBC’s Transportation Engineering
department are helping to reshape road safety priorities here and across North
America.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to report back on the development of a Bike Safety
index to represent both biking attractiveness and cyclist crash risk; and that:
1. The Bike Safety Index consists of bike network coverage, continuity,
complexity, signal density, and recreational density;
2. The Bike Safety Index be used as a tool to prioritize network
improvements, interventions and connection of network gaps;
3. The Bike Safety Index be used to inform signage, road markings and
information for active transportation users and motor vehicle drivers;
4. The Bike Safety Index be developed as zone-based approach, prioritizing
high crash areas first, as part of a comprehensive city-wide approach;
and
5. The UBC Transportation Engineering research group be consulted as to
whether opportunities for their work in this field might inform or
collaborate on a safety index.
B. THAT Council direct staff to consider and report back how a similar “walkability”
safety index might be developed to identify attractiveness and risks in order to
prioritize improvements and interventions in the public realm for all pedestrians,
including wheelchair users and other rollers.

3. Vancouver Supports Help Cities Lead Campaign
MOVED by Councillor Carr
SECONDED by Councillor Wiebe
WHEREAS
1. Help Cities Lead (HCL) is an education and awareness campaign to build
support for focused collaboration between the Province of British Columbia and
local governments on building climate policy. HCL is a coalition led by BC’s
Climate Caucus (https://www.climatecaucus.ca), members, members of the BC
Hydro Community Energy Managers Network and the Pembina Institute;
2. The HCL project team identified five regulatory measures where additional
authority for municipalities would help accelerate climate action and reducing
GHG emissions from new and existing buildings:
• Measure #1 – Regulating GHG emissions (not just energy efficiency) for
new buildings through the BC Energy Step Code;
• Measure #2 – Regulating GHG emissions for existing buildings –
Developing a new regulation that would set GHG emissions reduction
targets from existing buildings;
• Measure #3 – Mandatory building energy benchmarking and reporting –
Establishing energy benchmarking (the process of collecting and
monitoring energy data from a large number of buildings over time to
compare the performance of one participating building against similar
buildings) to compare building performance;
• Measure #4 – Mandatory home energy labelling – Requiring home energy
labelling when homes are sold, similar to legislation in place for energy
labelling for motor vehicles, furnaces, windows, lightbulbs, and kitchen
appliances; and
• Measure #5 – Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) financing –
Establishing PACE financing programs to allow property owners to
finance the up-front cost of building energy efficiency upgrades (e.g.,
more efficient heating systems, or windows) by paying the costs back
over time through a voluntary property tax assessment attached to the

Council Meeting
Minutes, April 27, 2021 19
property. If or when the property is sold, the financing would carry to the
new owner;
3. Direction to implement three of these measures (enabling local governments to
regulate GHG emissions for new buildings, home energy labelling, and PACE
financing) were included in the province’s ministerial mandate letters issued in
November 2020, but have not to date been implemented by the province.
However, building energy benchmarking and GHG requirements for existing
buildings were not mentioned in the mandate letters;
4. The City of Vancouver, through the authority of its own Vancouver Building
By-law, has already established GHG requirements for existing buildings.
Through the Climate Emergency Action Plan, the City has committed to a plan to
limit carbon pollution from existing buildings including mandatory building energy
benchmarking and reporting, and to request that the Province enable mandatory
home energy labelling and Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE) financing.
Joining with other municipalities in the request for these provincial government
actions could result in faster positive response; and
5. Metro Vancouver’s Climate Action Committee received correspondence from the
District of North Vancouver, City of Port Moody and City of Victoria asking that
Metro Vancouver support the Help Cities Lead campaign. Other Metro
Vancouver member municipalities that have joined this campaign include the City
of North Vancouver, District of West Vancouver, Langley and Maple Ridge. This
request will be presented to the Metro Vancouver Directors meeting scheduled
for May 30, 2021.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council formally endorse the Help Cities Lead
campaign and direct the Mayor to write a letter on behalf of Council to the Premier of
British Columbia and the following provincial ministers to voice support for the five
policies detailed in the Help Cities Lead report (see Whereas clause #2):
• Minister of Environment and Climate Change Strategy;
• Minister of Municipal Affairs;
• Minister of Energy, Mines, and Low-Carbon Innovation;
• Minister of Finance; and
• Attorney General and Minister responsible for Housing;
FURTHER THAT Council support staff participation in activities supporting the Help
Cities Lead campaign, including information-sharing presentations to other municipal
Councils.

will not result in rent increases, as the PACE loan repayments are matched to the
