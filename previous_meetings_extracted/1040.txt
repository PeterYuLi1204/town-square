At the Regular Council meeting on June 19, 2018, Vancouver City Council referred the following
item to the Standing Committee on Policy and Strategic Priorities meeting on June 20, 2018, to
hear from speakers.
MOVED by Councillor Carr
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. The goal of both the Short Term Incentives for Rental (STIR) Program, in place from
2009 to 2011, and the Rental 100 Program, in place since 2012, has been to
provide more affordable housing for Vancouver residents;

Standing Committee of Council on Policy on Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, June 20, 2018 19
2. Both the STIR and Rental 100 Programs have been subsidized by Vancouver
taxpayers through providing incentives to developers that include waiving
Development Cost Levies (DCLs);
3. Although the earlier STIR projects were not bound by any City by-law regarding the
maximum amount of rent per rental unit that could be charged at first occupancy,
the City of Vancouver has required that Rental 100 projects not exceed rents at first
occupancy as stipulated in the city’s DCL by-law; rents that are adjusted annually to
reflect CMHC-assessed market rents for the east and west sides of the city;
4. To date, the City has not tracked what has happened to rents in the STIR and
Rental 100 projects after each project’s completion.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to audit the completed Short Term Incentives for Rental
(STIR) and Rental 100 projects to compare rents as proposed in project proposals
approved by Council with rents at first occupancy and current rents and report back
to Council as quickly as feasible.
B. THAT the report back to Council include the cost to the City in terms of DCL waivers
per unit of rental housing, and recommendations to improve the effectiveness of the
Rental 100 program in delivering cost-effective affordable rental housing that meets
the needs of Vancouver renters.
Not put
The Chair ruled the motion out of order under section 4.3(c) of the Procedure Bylaw, as the Motion
contains direction already contained in Item 4c.
The Committee adjourned at 8:09 pm.
