4. Industrial Modernization and Intensification Framework Development Process
Update (Members’ Motion B.3)
At the Council meeting on January 31, 2023, Council referred the above-noted motion to the
Standing Committee on Policy and Strategic Priorities meeting on February 1, 2023, in order
to hear from speakers, followed by debate and decision.
The Committee heard from two speakers in support of the motion.
MOVED by Mayor Sim
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. In October 2020, Vancouver City Council received an Employment Lands and
Economy Review report from City staff;

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, February 01, 2023 6
2. The Employment Lands and Economy Review included forecasts showing that,
over the long term, the city is facing a potential gap between anticipated demand
and potential supply. Under a high demand scenario, the city could face a gap of
up to ~1.2M sq. ft. by 2051;
3. Technological innovations are fundamentally changing the relationship between
employment, productivity, and how industrial lands are occupied and used. Many
new businesses, notably industrial tech and high tech businesses, do not fit
neatly within the traditional paradigm of ‘heavy’ or ‘light’ industrial use and may
also be less impactful in terms of external nuisances while exhibiting non-
traditional levels of employment density;
4. Providing for and maintaining space to accommodate industrial businesses and
services, especially in the context of the rapidly changing nature of industrial
activities and the importance of new technology and high tech industries, is vital
to the economic well-being of our city and its success, prosperity, and
sustainability;
5. As the preferred location for employers in the region, and with more than half of
the city’s jobs located on only 10% of the land, Vancouver’s employment lands –
particularly the city’s industrial lands – are under tremendous pressure from
competing needs for space. This has led to rising commercial and industrial rents
in high demand areas and is leading some industrial businesses, and the jobs
they provide, to leave the city;
6. The desired space needs, location preferences, and associated employment and
transportation requirements are becoming more diverse and specialized,
particularly for technology businesses and tech industry land uses, amid the
rapidly evolving nature of business and industrial activities in the city;
7. City staff have outlined a number of ways in which the city’s limited industrial land
supply can be used more efficiently, including intensification of built forms where
local development restrictions, geotechnical / soil conditions, and market factors
permit;
8. The City has a draft Industrial intensification and Modernization Framework that
is intended to provide overarching guidance for the future of Vancouver’s
industrial lands, including work on recommended regulatory and policy changes
that will be brought forward to implement the framework;
9. In November 2021, Mayor and Council received an update memo from the
General Manager of Planning, Urban Design and Sustainability (Industrial
Modernization and Intensification Framework). The memo made note of staff’s
ongoing program of work toward the development of a comprehensive policy
framework for modernizing and intensifying Vancouver’s industrial areas and
advancing key directions identified in the City of Vancouver’s Employment Lands
and Economy Review (“ELER”), as well as key directions in the Metro Vancouver
Regional Industrial Lands Strategy (“MVRILS”);

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, February 01, 2023 7
10. The City’s draft Industrial Intensification and Modernization Framework includes
information regarding a series of incremental changes to facilitate the
intensification of industrial land use in the city in support of employment growth
over the long term;
11. The Framework reportedly has four key objectives:
i. Protect industrial lands for employment use
ii. Enable balanced industrial intensification
iii. Facilitate the right users in the right spaces
iv. Monitor, Coordinate and Report on industrial change;
12. The economic well-being of our city and its ongoing future success, prosperity,
and sustainability require that we provide for and maintain spaces to
accommodate industrial activities, businesses, and services to support
employment growth, bring jobs closer to people’s homes, reduce commute times,
lessen the negative impacts of industrial rent price escalation over the long term,
as we incrementally intensify, preserve, and even expand the city’s industrial
lands.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to report back by the end of
Q3 2023 with an update on the Industrial Modernization and Intensification Framework
development process, including information regarding any additional resources required
to advance key directions identified in the City of Vancouver’s Employment Lands and
Economy Review (“ELER”), as well as key directions identified in the Metro Vancouver
Regional Industrial Lands Strategy (“MVRILS”);
FURTHER THAT staff be directed to include specific information for Council in the
update report regarding:
i. potential opportunities and/or strategies to accelerate the Framework’s
development process, as well as challenges to date;
ii. staff recommendations to limit land speculation on the city’s vitally important,
and limited industrial land base;
iii. an overview of regulatory and policy changes that could potentially be
brought forward and considered by Council to facilitate the modernization,
preservation, and intensification of the city’s industrial and employment lands,
including advice on any need to impose a moratorium on the rezoning of
existing industrial lands for other land uses and an evaluation of the
concept/principle of one-for-one and two-for-one land swaps similar to
provisions in ALR policy;
iv. a general current state overview of the city’s industrial lands and any
challenges faced by the City’s and staff’s efforts to date to preserve
employment and industrial lands and spaces in the city, particularly those
industrial and employment lands supported by rapid transit (planned and/or
existing rapid transit and major transit routes).

5. Supporting and Expanding Vancouver’s Tech Hubs, Clusters, and Districts
(Members’ Motion B.4)
At the Council meeting on January 31, 2023, Council referred the above-noted motion to the
Standing Committee on Policy and Strategic Priorities meeting on February 1, 2023, in order
to hear from speakers, followed by debate and decision.
The Committee heard from two speakers in support of the motion.
MOVED by Mayor Sim
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. The City of Vancouver is widely recognized as the economic and cultural centre
of the rapidly growing Metro Vancouver region, with globally recognized
strengths in many key tech sectors including film and television, clean-tech and
climate solutions, life sciences, tourism, arts, and culture;
2. Vancouver is home to 34 percent of the region’s jobs and has more than 1,100
high tech businesses representing 40% of all high tech businesses in the region,
with the largest cluster located in downtown Vancouver accounting for 1/5 of all
high tech businesses in the region;
3. Technological innovations are fundamentally changing the relationship between
employment, productivity, and how industrial and employment lands are
occupied and used;
4. Many emerging tech and industrial tech businesses and their land use do not fit
neatly within the traditional paradigm of ‘heavy’ or ‘light’ industrial use and may
also be less impactful in terms of external nuisances while exhibiting and
supporting non-traditional levels of employment density;

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, February 01, 2023 9
5. The tech sector encompasses a wide range of activities including light
manufacturing, media and digital entertainment production, clean-tech and
biotech, software and hardware design, and various other uses;
6. The city of Vancouver is quickly becoming known as a preeminent North
American tech hub with “world-class talent and few immigration headaches” as
well as “great views in a convenient time zone.”;
7. Tech companies of all shapes and sizes, including “major players” like Microsoft,
Amazon, Apple, Cisco Systems, Samsung, SAP, and Zenefits, are choosing
Vancouver as a place to do technology business;
8. According to British price-comparison website Money.co.uk, Vancouver was
recently ranked as the No. 7 tech city in world, reportedly higher than any other
city outside the U.S., based on earnings, number of startups, and pedigree of
local universities. The quest for educated workers, and access to top-tier
universities, is one of the factors that give Vancouver competitive edge over
other cities as a global tech hub;
9. The space needs of tech businesses can vary widely, but typically require a
diversity of spaces at different scales, including offices, production space, and
logistical facilities;
10. High tech hubs and clusters drive innovation and entrepreneurship supported by
access to capital, knowledge, and talent;
11. Vancouver’s tech sector is supported by a first-class education system that is
graduating tomorrow’s tech leaders and innovators from top-calibre institutions
and speciality schools;
12. Vancouver is an emerging centre for Artificial Intelligence (AI) with over 64 AI
companies thanks to an already established talent pool in visual computing and
graphics;
13. Some of the best schools for software development and AI are located in
Vancouver, including UBC which is ranked as the number 2 tech school in
Canada, and in the top 25 in the world according to the QS World University
Ranking;
14. The City of Vancouver, as part of a unified vision for future land use in the city,
notably as articulated in the Vancouver Plan and Broadway Plan, is committed to
protecting, expanding, and supporting industrial and employment land areas,
business districts, campus institutions, and a broad and diverse base of jobs and
services in the city;
15. As the preferred location for employers in the region, and with more than half of
the city’s jobs located on only 10% of the land, Vancouver’s employment lands –
particularly the city’s industrial lands – are under tremendous pressure from
competing needs for space which has led to rising commercial and industrial
rents in high demand areas;

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, February 01, 2023 10
16. City staff have indicated that efforts currently underway to support the tech sector
and preserve employment and industrial lands and spaces supported by transit
(particularly regional rapid transit initiatives), not only include the Broadway
corridor but are also reflected in the Rupert and Renfrew industrial lands planning
processes;
17. In November 2021, the then Mayor and Council received an update memo from
the General Manager of Planning, Urban Design and Sustainability (Industrial
Modernization and Intensification Framework) regarding staff’s ongoing program
of work toward the development of a comprehensive policy framework for
modernizing and intensifying Vancouver’s industrial areas and advancing key
directions identified in the City of Vancouver’s Employment Lands and Economy
Review (“ELER”), as well as key directions in the Metro Vancouver Regional
Industrial Lands Strategy (“MVRILS”);
18. The economic well-being of our city and its ongoing future success, prosperity,
and sustainability require that we not only have strategies to provide for, expand,
and maintain lands and spaces to accommodate traditional industrial activities
and businesses, but that we also ensure that we secure spaces for the
integration and growth of high tech hubs and clusters in the city that drive
innovation and entrepreneurship in the city’s tech ecosystem and are
well-supported by access to capital, knowledge, and talent.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to explore strategies to
facilitate and aggregate new and existing tech hubs and clusters in the city and for staff
to report back by the end of Q3 2023 with recommendations and strategic directions for
Council to consider to ensure that spaces for integrating and growing high tech hubs and
clusters in the city, whether they be in the city’s traditional industrial lands or located in
new and/or renewing areas, are suitably reflected in the City’s planning processes so
that Vancouver can sustainably attract and support 21st century economic activities to
drive innovation, collaboration, and entrepreneurship within and surrounding the city’s
evolving tech ecosystem;
FURTHER THAT staff be directed to co-ordinate their recommendations and strategic
direction advice to Council, and otherwise integrate these within, the context of staff’s
ongoing program of work toward the development of a comprehensive policy framework
for modernizing and intensifying Vancouver’s industrial areas and advancing key
directions identified in the City of Vancouver’s Employment Lands and Economy Review
(“ELER”), as well as key directions in the Metro Vancouver Regional Industrial Lands
Strategy (“MVRILS”).

3. Piloting a Culturally Appropriate, Indigenous-led Supportive Housing and
Wellness Centre Project in Partnership with Indigenous Peoples (Members’ Motion
B.2)
At the Council meeting on January 31, 2023, Council referred the above-noted motion to the
Standing Committee on Policy and Strategic Priorities meeting on February 1, 2023, in order
to hear from speakers, followed by debate and decision.
The Committee heard from one speaker in support of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Bligh
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. In July 2014, The City of Vancouver officially became a City of Reconciliation
with the formal adoption – on July 8, 2014 – of a Reconciliation Framework
pursuant to and resulting from the June 2013 Council declaration of a “Year of
Reconciliation in Vancouver”;
2. Since July 2014, the City and successive Councils have created new policies to
support Reconciliation efforts. Council continues to explore ways to work toward
Reconciliation with the Musqueam, Squamish, and Tsleil-Waututh Nations, and
the urban Indigenous communities and peoples living in Vancouver;
3. The City of Vancouver has the third largest urban Indigenous population of any
Canadian city, and there is a longstanding recognition of the need for
Indigenous-specific programs and services in the city that are able to provide
traditional, spiritual, and cultural health and healing supports, notably, but not
exclusively, in the Downtown East Side (DTES);
4. The Reconciliation goals of the City include establishing and maintaining
mutually respectful relationships between Indigenous and non-Indigenous
peoples and to respect the rights of the local First Nations and urban Indigenous
peoples;
5. The City of Vancouver has an Urban Indigenous Peoples' Advisory Committee,
the mandate of which is to advise Council and City staff on enhancing access
and inclusion for urban Indigenous Peoples and enabling their full participation in
City services and civic life;
6. The City of Vancouver recognizes that Indigenous populations in Vancouver
experience some of the greatest systemic inequities in health and well being, and
-

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, February 01, 2023 12
that the systems, methods, concepts, and indicators used to understand these
inequities must themselves be created and grounded in the knowledge within
Indigenous communities, rather than being imposed from outside;
7. The 2016 census estimated that 61,455 Indigenous persons live in Metro
Vancouver, with the City of Vancouver having the largest urban Indigenous
population in the region with nearly 14,000 people counted in the census
(potentially an undercount due to the fact that many census respondents
reportedly do not self identify);
8. Within the City of Van-couver, the largest numbers of Indigenous residents live in
central and north eastern neighbourhoods, with Strathcona and Grandview-
Woodland having the largest percentage of population identifying as
Indigenous; -
9. Access to traditional, culturally appropriate, and safe health care practices are
believed to be equally, if not more important, than access to mainstream
nonIndigenous health care. Indigenous concepts of wellness are distinct from
western notions of wellness, and are unique to each Indigenous community’s
respective worldview. As such, there is a growing recognition of the need for
indicators – such as those in the City’s Healthy City Strategy (HCS) – that reflect
Indigenous notions of wellness;
10. The province’s First Nations Health Authority (FNHA) has the formal mandate to
plan, design, manage, and fund the delivery of First Nations health programs
across BC and actively works to transform and reform the way health care is
delivered to Indigenous people in BC. The FNHA is committed to supporting
Indigenous individuals, families, and communities in achieving the highest level
of health and wellness;
11. The FNHA subscribes to the belief that wellness starts with individuals who then
influence their families, who then influence their communities, who in turn
influence their regions. Each “champion of wellness” has circles of influence
through connections in their family, in their work, and in their own communities.
Wellness can be championed by sharing the history of Indigenous wellness,
sharing one’s own stories, persisting through setbacks, and shifting focus from
Illness to Wellness;
12. Vancouver Coastal Health (VCH) is likewise committed to supporting the journey
of reconciliation with Indigenous peoples in the region and is committed to
improving the health of and access to culturally safe healthcare for the
Indigenous people in the health region. The VCH Indigenous Health team
collaborates, coordinates, and integrates their health programs and services with
FNHA to achieve better health outcomes for Indigenous peoples;
13. The April 2022 “City of Vancouver Housing Needs Report” notes that Indigenous
households face unique housing challenges and are disproportionately more
likely to be renters than owners, with almost half of Indigenous households
spending 30% or more of their income on shelter. Homelessness and housing
insecurity remain significant issues in Vancouver, with Indigenous persons

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, February 01, 2023 13
overrepresented among those experiencing homelessness. Responses to
Indigenous housing needs are reflected in work of local First Nations and groups
such as the Aboriginal Housing Management Association (AHMA) which
advocate for partnerships to deliver secure, affordable housing for Indigenous
people in Vancouver and the region;
14. The City of Vancouver is committed to strengthening its relationship with urban
Indigenous organizations and community groups that offer culturally appropriate
services to the urban Indigenous peoples living in Vancouver;
15. The City of Vancouver has an “Indigenous Healing and Wellness Grants”
program that supports projects that provide for traditional, spiritual and cultural
healing and wellness activities in Vancouver's urban Indigenous community;
16. Culturally appropriate, Indigenous-led supportive housing and wellness project
examples in the city that the City of Vancouver has been involved in include the
Aboriginal Land Trust project at 52-92 E Hastings, Women Deliver Project, and
the UNYA redevelopment project;
17. There are potentially other projects in the city, either being developed by the City
or by other organizations, which might offer additional opportunities to deliver
culturally appropriate, Indigenous-led supportive housing and wellness centres.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to report back by the end of
Q2 of 2023 with a review of options and opportunities to deliver new culturally
appropriate, Indigenous-led supportive housing and wellness centre projects in the city
in partnership with Indigenous peoples, including information regarding potential
contributions to these projects by the City (e.g., land, funding, other support, etc.);
FURTHER THAT staff be directed to consult with all relevant stakeholders on the
relevant options and opportunities for projects, including but not limited to consultation
with the xwməθkwəy̓ əm (Musqueam Indian Band), Sḵwx̱wú7mesh (Squamish Nation),
sə̓ lílwətaʔɬ (Tsleil-Waututh Nation), the city’s urban Indigenous communities and
peoples, the City’s Urban Indigenous Peoples' Advisory Committee, the FNHA, VCH, the
Metro Vancouver Aboriginal Executive Council, the Urban Native Youth Association
(UNYA), and other urban Indigenous organizations and community groups that offer
culturally appropriate, Indigenous-led supportive housing and wellness services in the
city and region generally.

believed to be equally, if not more important, than access to mainstream
nonIndigenous health care. Indigenous concepts of wellness are distinct from
western notions of wellness, and are unique to each Indigenous community’s
respective worldview. As such, there is a growing recognition of the need for
indicators – such as those in the City’s Healthy City Strategy (HCS) – that reflect
Indigenous notions of wellness;
10. The province’s First Nations Health Authority (FNHA) has the formal mandate to
plan, design, manage, and fund the delivery of First Nations health programs
across BC and actively works to transform and reform the way health care is
delivered to Indigenous people in BC. The FNHA is committed to supporting
Indigenous individuals, families, and communities in achieving the highest level
of health and wellness;
11. The FNHA subscribes to the belief that wellness starts with individuals who then
influence their families, who then influence their communities, who in turn
influence their regions. Each “champion of wellness” has circles of influence
through connections in their family, in their work, and in their own communities.
Wellness can be championed by sharing the history of Indigenous wellness,
sharing one’s own stories, persisting through setbacks, and shifting focus from
Illness to Wellness;
12. Vancouver Coastal Health (VCH) is likewise committed to supporting the journey
of reconciliation with Indigenous peoples in the region and is committed to
improving the health of and access to culturally safe healthcare for the
Indigenous people in the health region. The VCH Indigenous Health team
collaborates, coordinates, and integrates their health programs and services with
FNHA to achieve better health outcomes for Indigenous peoples;
13. The April 2022 “City of Vancouver Housing Needs Report” notes that Indigenous
households face unique housing challenges and are disproportionately more
likely to be renters than owners, with almost half of Indigenous households
spending 30% or more of their income on shelter. Homelessness and housing

insecurity remain significant issues in Vancouver, with Indigenous persons
overrepresented among those experiencing homelessness. Responses to
Indigenous housing needs are reflected in work of local First Nations and groups
such as the Aboriginal Housing Management Association (AHMA) which
advocate for partnerships to deliver secure, affordable housing for Indigenous
people in Vancouver and the region;
14. The City of Vancouver is committed to strengthening its relationship with urban
Indigenous organizations and community groups that offer culturally appropriate
services to the urban Indigenous peoples living in Vancouver;
15. The City of Vancouver has an “Indigenous Healing and Wellness Grants”
program that supports projects that provide for traditional, spiritual and cultural
healing and wellness activities in Vancouver's urban Indigenous community;
16. Culturally appropriate, Indigenous-led supportive housing and wellness project
examples in the city that the City of Vancouver has been involved in include the
Aboriginal Land Trust project at 52-92 E Hastings, Women Deliver Project, and
the UNYA redevelopment project;
17. There are potentially other projects in the city, either being developed by the City
or by other organizations, which might offer additional opportunities to deliver
culturally appropriate, Indigenous-led supportive housing and wellness centres.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to report back by the end of
Q2 of 2023 with a review of options and opportunities to deliver new culturally
appropriate, Indigenous-led supportive housing and wellness centre projects in the city
in partnership with Indigenous peoples, including information regarding potential
contributions to these projects by the City (e.g., land, funding, other support, etc.);
FURTHER THAT staff be directed to consult with all relevant stakeholders on the
relevant options and opportunities for projects, including but not limited to consultation
with the xwməθkwəy̓ əm (Musqueam Indian Band), Sḵwx̱wú7mesh (Squamish Nation),
sə̓ lílwətaʔɬ (Tsleil-Waututh Nation), the city’s urban Indigenous communities and
peoples, the City’s Urban Indigenous Peoples' Advisory Committee, the FNHA, VCH, the
Metro Vancouver Aboriginal Executive Council, the Urban Native Youth Association
(UNYA), and other urban Indigenous organizations and community groups that offer
culturally appropriate, Indigenous-led supportive housing and wellness services in the
city and region generally;
AND FURTHER THAT Council direct staff to include investments within the 2023
City Operating Budget to ensure this work is sufficiently resourced. And that this
include funding to continue work underway on implementing recommendations
from the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and
Girls (MMIWG) (Approximately $150,000).
