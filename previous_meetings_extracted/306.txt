At 2:35 pm, Councillor Bligh rose on a point of order, under section 8.7(f) of the Procedure
By-law, stating the amendment above is dilatory and frivolous because the definition of the word
“affordable” is encompassed within the definition of “non-market housing”, and asked the Chair
to rule whether the amendment was in order. After consulting with staff, the Chair ruled the
amendment in order as staff confirmed the word “affordable” can be used separately from the
words “non-market housing”, with different definitions.
