5. Improving Climate Resilience and Reducing Emissions in Existing Multi-Family
Buildings (Members’ Motion B2)
At the Council meeting on April 11, 2023, Council referred the above-noted motion to the
Standing Committee on City Finance and Services meeting on April 12, 2023, in order to hear
from speakers, followed by debate and decision.
MOVED by Councillor Klassen
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. The City of Vancouver has a long history of addressing climate change going
back many decades. For example, in 1990 Council received the “Clouds of
Change” report which called for strong actions to reduce carbon emissions and
other greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the city. The “Clouds of Change” report
helped to establish Vancouver as a leader in addressing climate change and
other environmental challenges and put the city on the path to building resilient
infrastructure while implementing meaningful sustainability strategies;
2. Adapting to climate change means understanding the climate we are likely to
experience in the future and creating proactive plans that take advantage of
opportunities and prepare for impacts. Understanding climate change and
adapting to it means pursuing mitigation strategies that can reduce and/or
eliminate greenhouse gas emissions and help to lessen the global impacts of
climate change;
3. We are already experiencing the impacts of climate change in Vancouver,
notably in the form of a warmer climate with a greater frequency of extreme
weather events such as heat domes, wild fire smoke, and atmospheric rivers.
These climate changes which are already in evidence have direct implications for
how we heat, cool, and protect our homes from the elements. For example,
warmer winters may result in reduced heating needs for our homes while
warmer, hotter summers may increase how much cooling we require; i
4. Given that 55% to 60% of the carbon emissions generated in Vancouver come
from the heating of water and spaces in buildings, cities such as Vancouver have
a unique opportunity to take meaningful climate action at a local level through a

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, April 12, 2023 6
variety of land-use, planning, regulatory, and fiscal tools: Notably by reducing
and/or eliminating carbon emissions by changing how our buildings are heated,
cooled, designed, and constructed; ii
5. Over the past decades, Vancouver has made numerous strides in changing how
Vancouverites think about the environment and the impacts of climate change.
For its part, the City has taken progressive steps to improve the sustainability of
City operations, such as programs to significantly reduce greenhouse gas
emissions and fossil fuel use in City-run buildings and vehicles;
6. The City has also embarked upon an ambitious Climate Emergency Action Plan
(CEAP) designed to cut Vancouver’s carbon emissions by 50% by 2030: Notably
by focusing on areas where the City has jurisdiction such as land-use planning,
transportation, buildings, and infrastructure, and mitigations and adaptions
through the enhancement and protection of natural systems;
7. The City also has almost completed its plan to transition to zero emissions
buildings (ZEB) in all new construction by 2030 by making use of various
renewable energies and setting limits on emissions and energy use in new
buildings;
8. The City, in partnership with the province of British Columbia, also offers rebates
and services to help those living in single family homes, duplexes, and/or
townhomes to reduce emissions and make their homes more healthy and
comfortable. Likewise, the City’s Greenest City Grant program offers grants for
place-based, community-driven initiatives that help advance sustainability,
including the City of Vancouver’s Climate Emergency Action Plan, while
advancing equity objectives; and
9. City staff have identified a significant opportunity to reduce carbon emissions on
a targeted basis in older multi-family buildings in Vancouver, including rental
apartments where some of the city’s most vulnerable populations live without air
conditioning amid hotter summers. These homes have typically fallen outside of
energy efficiency programs offered for single family homes.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to explore the establishment
of an incentive-based pilot program, to be funded through existing budgets, that
specifically targets existing and older multi-family buildings such as, but not limited to,
condominium buildings, rental apartment buildings, and care homes, and to facilitate and
otherwise assist the owners of these buildings to reduce their carbon emissions through
energy retrofits such as installing high-efficiency electric heat pumps while also
improving the cooling and indoor air quality of these buildings;
FURTHER THAT staff be directed to develop and incorporate a design challenge
component for this incentive-based pilot program to enable the exploration of innovative
retrofit solutions for selected buildings that can help the City to identify common barriers
to the retrofitting of existing and older multi-family buildings, to demonstrate replicable
innovative solutions, and to better understand the financial challenges and opportunities
for owners;

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, April 12, 2023 7
FURTHER THAT staff be directed to explore partnering opportunities with other levels of
government, including BC Hydro, to leverage and otherwise scale up and add to the
City’s available funding for this incentive-based pilot program;
AND FURTHER THAT staff be directed to report back with recommendations to Council
in 2023 on the proposed program.

i. Rising temperatures contribute to the “Urban Heat Island Effect” where dense urban areas with more
impervious surfaces like concrete and tall buildings are hotter than surrounding areas. These areas are
hotter because materials like concrete soak up and retain heat unlike trees, soil and other permeable
surfaces. https://vancouver.ca/green-vancouver/homes-climate.aspx
ii. In Vancouver, nearly 60% of our carbon pollution comes from buildings. This is mainly from burning
natural gas (which is methane, a fossil fuel), for heating our homes and our hot water. To fight climate
change, the City is seeking to reduce emissions from buildings by 50% by 2030. That means ambitious
actions to shift away from the use of fossil fuels in favour of equipment that uses clean and renewable
energy sources. https://vancouver.ca/green-vancouver/green-home-retrofits.aspx

Standing Committee on City Finance and Services meeting on April 12, 2023, in order to hear
from speakers, followed by debate and decision.

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, April 12, 2023 8
MOVED by Councillor Klassen
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. The production, consumption, and sale of liquor in BC is governed by the
provincial Liquor Control and Licencing Act (the “Act”);
2. Municipalities have no independent jurisdiction with respect to liquor and, in
particular, the Vancouver Charter does not give the City any jurisdiction over
liquor consumption or sales. The role that the City plays in the sale and
consumption of alcohol is set out in the Liquor Control and Licensing Act.
Municipalities set local by-laws and policies;
3. In 2015, the Province changed the Liquor Control and Licensing Board (LCLB)
regulations to allow for the sale of liquor in grocery stores under one of two
models: wine-on-shelf or store-in-store;
4. In December 2015, Vancouver City staff presented Council with a
recommendation to pilot the wine-on-shelf model in five grocery stores. Council
deferred this recommended action to solicit “feedback from the public, and
consulted with key stakeholders”;
5. In June 2017, a city-wide liquor policy review culminated with a staff report to
Council (i.e., June 14, 2017, Liquor Policy Review – Recommended Actions),
which included consultation with key stakeholders such as Vancouver Coastal
Health, Vancouver Police Department, Tourism Vancouver, and industry
representatives. The policy review aimed to assess the existing by-laws, policies,
and guidelines to reflect evolving needs and issues and to align City liquor policy
with the recent changes to Provincial liquor policies;
6. At present, liquor retailing within grocery stores in the City of Vancouver remains
limited to the “store-within-a-store” model, with “on-shelf” retailing in grocery
stores not permitted by the municipality as per the regulations implemented in
2017;
7. Examples of municipalities that allow for wine-on-shelf sales include Kamloops,
Kelowna, Langley, Maple Ridge, Mission, Abbotsford, Penticton, Pemberton,
Parksville, Prince George, Richmond, Surrey, District of North Vancouver, Delta,
White Rock, and recently the City of Coquitlam;
8. The current provincial liquor regulations allow retailers to support local farmers
without harming the interests of existing liquor retailers. In fact, “mom and pop”
liquor retailers often benefit from increased foot traffic as a result of their
proximity to grocery stores given the restrictions surrounding the products
grocery stores are allowed to offer on sale; and
9. Given the non-problematic success of the wine-on-shelf model for grocery stores
as seen across the province since the changes to regulations in 2015, along with
the considerable change in the provincial retail landscape since that time, and

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, April 12, 2023 9
the span of time since the City of Vancouver last addressed the question of wine
sales in grocery stores, it is timely for Council to revisit the wine-on-shelf model
for grocery stores in Vancouver and the policy implemented in 2017.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to report back with updates
to the City’s grocery liquor retail store guidelines no later than the end of Q2 of 2023,
including any by-law amendments that may be required, in order to allow for wine-on-
shelf sales in Vancouver grocery stores to ensure greater consumer selection and
convenience and to align with current policies, practices, and regulations already in
place across the Metro Vancouver region and province-wide.
CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY (Vote No. 09175)
(Mayor Sim absent for the vote)
7. Amping up the Arts Event License Policy to Support Arts & Culture in Vancouver
(Members’ Motion B4)
At the Council meeting on April 11, 2023, Council referred the above-noted motion to the
Standing Committee on City Finance and Services meeting on April 12, 2023, in order to hear
from speakers, followed by debate and decision.
The Committee heard from three speakers in support of the recommendations.
MOVED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. Vancouver prides itself on being a city alive with creativity, with amazing music,
dance, new media, theatre, festivals, film, design, exhibitions, galleries,
museums, and special events. On its website, the City literally invites people to
“Go out and explore arts and culture in Vancouver”;
2. Culture|Shift is Vancouver’s Culture Plan for 2020-2029. It provides a framework
with strategic directions and actions to align and to increase – among other
things – the City’s support for arts and culture, championing creators, building on
commitments to reconciliation and equity, introducing bold moves to advance
community-led cultural infrastructure, and positioning Vancouver as a thriving
hub for music; i
3. Cultural spaces are essential. For any healthy, vibrant city to sustain and develop
cultural vitality, artists and culture makers need access to affordable, diverse and
safe venues to showcase their work and engage audiences. Enabling cultural
spaces enables arts and cultural activities to thrive;
4. Concurrently with the Culture|Shift plan, the Making Space for Arts and Culture
report was approved by Council in September 2019, and laid out a long term
vision to optimize City policies and tools to secure, enhance, and develop vibrant,
affordable, and accessible arts and cultural spaces. Making Space for Arts and

Culture is an integral part of the Culture|Shift plan that helps to guide the City’s
work in partnership with the community to secure, enhance, and develop
affordable and accessible spaces where artists and cultural workers can live,
work, and share their work;
5. As detailed in the Making Space for Arts and Culture report, one of the most
critical challenges facing arts and culture is the availability of affordable spaces
and displacement of existing spaces due to accelerated development, rapidly
rising industrial and commercial land values, and competition with higher land
uses. Vancouver is effectively losing affordable places for artists to live, work,
and share their work despite growth in the cultural non-profit sectors’ capacity to
collaborate and develop co-located spaces and repurpose old buildings with new
uses. The city’s arts and culture sector remains overwhelmingly vulnerable to
displacement;
6. In March 2013, Council approved a small-scale two-year Arts and Culture Indoor
Event Licence Program (“Arts Event Licence”) pilot to explore permitting arts and
culture events in a range of industrial and retail spaces on an occasional basis.
The pilot program simplified application processes by combining five City and
VPD reviews into one approval, making it easier for small scale, occasional
events to be both legal and much safer; ii
7. The Arts Event Licence pilot program came about due to a growing demand for
alternative venues for the presentation of innovative works that could allow
audiences to engage in new ways outside of conventional venues such as
theatres or halls which are not always suitable for smaller performances or
audiences, to support limited budgets, and/or where the artistic intent involves
site-specific works;
8. Between April 2013 and March 2015, over a hundred diverse events took place
under the Arts Event Licence pilot program including a variety of music
performances (often involving album releases), new works at exhibition/book
launches in a pop-up gallery, and a shared rehearsal studio event that hosted
over a hundred arts presenters, artists, and producers to see and share excerpts
of tour-ready works and projects in development. By all accounts, the pilot was
well received;
9. In September, 2015, Council formally adopted the Arts and Culture Indoor Event
Licence (“Arts Event Licence”) as a permanent program based on the positive
outcomes of the two-year pilot and direction was given to amend the Zoning and
Development By-law to change the definition of “Arts and Culture Indoor Event”
to increase the allowed frequency of events from two to three days per month;
10. Through the Arts Event Licence, the City has been able to provide support to arts
and culture events in the city by bringing flexibility to occasional venues, whether
it is a studio, warehouse, factory or other alternative performance space and
make it easier to host pop-up performances and events in unconventional spaces
including studios, warehouses, factories, offices, shops and wholesale space;
and

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, April 12, 2023 11
11. In alignment with the City’s goals to better support arts and culture and champion
creators, there is opportunity to expand the number of events allowed monthly
through the Arts Event License.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to undertake a short-term
review of the Arts Event License Policy and relevant by-laws as it applies to indoor
events (as well as consideration of any related or relevant policies and strategies) and
bring recommendations forward for Council’s consideration by June 2023 on the
potential to increase and/or double the frequency of events allowed each month under
the By-law toward creating greater flexibility for the arts and culture sector and
contributing to a more culturally vibrant city for everyone.

i Culture|Shift illuminated the cultural sector’s pivotal role in Vancouver’s economic vibrancy, tourism and
prosperity, and reasserted the fact that creative industries and cultural sector have a critical impact on
growth, and attracting and retaining talent across sectors (https://vancouver.ca/files/cov/2022-12-12-
culture-shift-update.pdf).
The Culture|Shift cultural plan was preceded by the Culture Plan for Vancouver 2008-2018, the City’s first
comprehensive cultural strategy which established a vision and actions for strengthening and growing the
arts and culture sector. The Culture Plan for Vancouver 2008-2018 was instrumental in shifting paradigms
for cultural support towards fostering cultural leadership, enabling partnerships, increasing community
engagement, modernizing systems, and providing adaptable support programs.

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, April 12, 2023 14
Economic impact studies conducted in 2019 to inform Culture|Shift directions and actions revealed that
cultural economic production outperforms many traditional industries: the economic impact of the creative
industries and cultural sector included a 2.7% makeup of British Columbia’s Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) and 4% of total employment. During 2018, culture’s gross product came in at $7.9B, exceeding
Agriculture ($5.8B) and Utilities ($6.3B), and rivaled Accommodation and Food ($8B), as well as Mining,
Oil, and Gas ($8.2B). Music alone had $690 million in direct economic impact, with approx. 8,000 in direct
music jobs and 6,500 in indirect jobs.
ii The majority of events took place in neighbourhoods where artists are concentrated: the Downtown
Eastside, Mount Pleasant and Grandview-Woodlands.

8. Mayor’s Budget Task Force (Members’ Motion B5)
At the Council meeting on April 11, 2023, Council referred the above-noted motion to the
Standing Committee on City Finance and Services meeting on April 12, 2023, in order to hear
from speakers, followed by debate and decision.
MOVED by Mayor Sim
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. The City of Vancouver has various advisory bodies that provide
recommendations, advice, and information to Council and/or staff on matters that
relate to the mandate of an advisory body and/or on any matters which may be
referred to the advisory body by Council or staff;
2. Advisory bodies are a form of civic engagement, but unlike other, more
short-term engagement strategies, they typically allow residents the opportunity
to develop their knowledge of civic systems and/or more effectively and
consistently convey recommendations based on expertise and lived experience;
3. The City has five main types of Advisory Body. These are:
• Type A (established by Council; advisory to Council and staff)

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, April 12, 2023 15
• Type B (established by Council; advisory to staff)
• Type C (established through by-law or other legislation, generally for
statutory functions)
• Type D (task forces for the provision of policy advice and
recommendations on a specific issue or topic, with input from the City
Manager as necessary)
• Other (appointed by Council, but advisory to an external body – e.g. VPL
Board, PNE Board);
4. Notable examples of Type D task force advisory Bodies include, but are not
limited to:
• The Task Force on Implementing UNDRIP in the City of Vancouver
(established in 2021 to provide advice to the Mayor and Council)
• The Opioid Emergency Task Force (established in 2018)
• The Mayor’s Task Force on Mental Health and Addictions (established in
2013 to provide recommendations to Mayor and council on priority
actions to address the mental health and addictions crisis);
5. Each year, the Mayor and Council have a statutory obligation to oversee and
approve a budget and budget process that balances the need to provide
services, facilities, and infrastructure in ways that meet the needs of residents
and businesses and with the equal desire to keep property tax and utility rate
increases at a manageable level;
6. On November 29, 2022, Draft Current State Operating and Capital budgets were
presented to City Council for information as a starting point for discussion and
engagement to help align multi-year planning with the new Council’s priorities;
7. On December 6, 2022, City Council approved the 2023 Capital Budget and
deferred the 2023 Operating Budget to early 2023 for further consideration;
8. On February 28, 2023, Vancouver City Council approved an operating budget for
2023 totalling $1.97 billion, and a property tax increase of 10.7% driven by a 1%
increase for additional infrastructure renewal, 1% for reserve replenishment for
financial sustainability, 3% for Vancouver Police Department (VPD) services, and
5.7% for funding across all City services, as well as risks around uncertain costs
for the whole city; and
9. A 10.7% property tax increase is neither a sustainable nor a desirable financial
path for the City of Vancouver.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council support Mayor Ken Sim’s appointment
of a Mayor’s Budget Task Force (Type D advisory body) to review the current City of
Vancouver budget, examine where funds are allocated on a line item basis, and report
its findings in preparation for the 2024 City of Vancouver budget process to – among
other things – identify opportunities to improve service levels, processes, and

liabilities, CAPEX, pensions, and equipment replacement costs in accordance with the
Terms of Reference outlined in Appendix A.
