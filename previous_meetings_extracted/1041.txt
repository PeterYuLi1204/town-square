MOVED by Councillor Reimer
SECONDED by Councillor Jang

recognizes rights to self-determination, language, culture, and health as well as
rights connected to equity, justice and access;
2. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) calls to action recognize the
needs of off reserve Indigenous communities;
3. 70 per cent of Indigenous peoples in British Columbia and Canada live off
reserve in urban centres;
4. Urban Indigenous peoples move to and live in urban centres for many of the
same reasons all people make this choice: for work, education, access to
amenities, to be closer to loved ones, and to create a good life for themselves
and their children;
5. Urban Indigenous peoples have a long history of convening, programming,
innovating and collaborating to serve across geographic and cultural differences
and demonstrate strong skills and capacities in this space;
6. Current federal and provincial government programs have failed to acknowledge
urban Indigenous peoples in significant policies, programs and funding
opportunities linked to social health determinants including poverty reduction,
housing, training and education, heritage and culture, child care and health;
7. Urban Indigenous peoples are over-represented across health and social
inequities.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT the motion below regarding the need for
equitable recognition and support for urban indigenous communities in policy, programs,
funding and consultation in British Columbia be submitted to the Union of BC
Municipalities (UBCM) for consideration at the 2018 Annual Convention:

WHEREAS the United Nations (UN) Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous
Peoples recognizes rights to self-determination, language, culture, and health as
well as rights connected to equity, justice and access and the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission (TRC) calls to action recognize the needs of the 70
per cent of Indigenous people in British Columbia that live off reserve in urban
centres, largely to pursue work, education, access to amenities, to be closer to
loved ones, and to create a good life for themselves and their children;

and social inequities, yet current provincial government programs have failed to
acknowledge urban Indigenous peoples in significant policies, programs and
funding opportunities linked to social health determinants including poverty
reduction, housing, training and education, heritage and culture, child care and
health.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT the Province recognize and treat urban
Indigenous people equitably in provincial policies and regulation, programs and
funding initiatives, and consultations that are tied to root causes of inequities and
improved social determinants of health including housing, access and connection
to culture, education and training, child and family services and income
generation.
FURTHER THAT the motion below regarding the need for equitable recognition and
support for urban indigenous communities in policy, programs, funding and consultation
in Canada be forwarded to the Federation of Canadian Municipalities (FCM) for their
consideration:

4. Assessing Affordability and Effectiveness of Short Term Incentives for Rental
(STIR) and Rental 100 Programs
MOVED by Councillor Carr
SECONDED by Councillor De Genova
WHEREAS
1. The goal of both the Short Term Incentives for Rental (STIR) Program, in place
from 2009 to 2011, and the Rental 100 Program, in place since 2012, has been
to provide more affordable housing for Vancouver residents;
2. Both the STIR and Rental 100 Programs have been subsidized by Vancouver
taxpayers through providing incentives to developers that include waiving
Development Cost Levies (DCLs);
3. Although the earlier STIR projects were not bound by any City by-law regarding
the maximum amount of rent per rental unit that could be charged at first
occupancy, the City of Vancouver has required that Rental 100 projects not
exceed rents at first occupancy as stipulated in the city’s DCL by-law; rents that
are adjusted annually to reflect CMHC-assessed market rents for the east and
west sides of the city;
4. To date, the City has not tracked what has happened to rents in the STIR and
Rental 100 projects after each project’s completion.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to audit the completed Short Term Incentives for Rental
(STIR) and Rental 100 projects to compare rents as proposed in project
proposals approved by Council with rents at first occupancy and current rents
and report back to Council as quickly as feasible.
B. THAT the report back to Council include the cost to the City in terms of DCL
waivers per unit of rental housing, and recommendations to improve the
effectiveness of the Rental 100 program in delivering cost-effective affordable
rental housing that meets the needs of Vancouver renters.
referred
REFERRAL MOVED by Councillor Reimer
SECONDED by Councillor Jang

5. Special Federation of Canadian Municipalities (FCM) Advocacy Fund
MOVED by Acting Mayor Louie
SECONDED by Mayor Robertson
WHEREAS
1. The Federation of Canadian Municipalities (FCM) has a long track record of
delivering gains for all Canadian municipalities, like the permanent Gas Tax
Fund; and
2. The FCM’s hard work and influence has significantly shaped historic gains for
local governments starting with our Election 2015 breakthrough, including:
• The Investing in Canada infrastructure plan — a 12-year, $180 billion
federal investment in local infrastructure, from public transit to wastewater
system upgrades;
• Canada’s first-ever national housing strategy, including key
commitments to repair and build affordable housing across the country;
• A strengthened seat at the table, including through unprecedented
engagement with federal ministers, as well as with opposition leaders and
the Prime Minister;
• A predictable federal allocation model for transit expansions that puts
municipalities in the driver’s seat;
• A $2 billion rural and northern infrastructure fund — the biggest
investment of its kind in a generation;
• Better access to high-speed broadband through the federal Connect to
Innovate program and the CRTC decision to mandate universal
broadband access;
• New capacity-building programs on asset management and climate
change — led by FCM — as well as a new $125 million capital
investment in FCM’s Green Municipal Fund;
3. The 2019 election is a vital opportunity to build on those gains and to consolidate
the municipal sector’s position as an essential national partner to any federal
government no matter which party wins the next federal election;
4. The FCM’s Special Advocacy Fund will drive FCM’s largest and most ambitious
campaign ever, which will result in an extended campaign reaching out to every
federal party to keep municipal priorities front-and-centre heading into
Election 2019, as well as in the crucial first months of a new government.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council approves the municipality’s participation
in the Federation of Canadian Municipality’s (FCM) Special Advocacy Fund for the 2019
federal election of $21,400 per year for the next 2 years.

NEW BUSINESS
1. Provincial Single-Use Item Reduction Strategy
MOVED by Councillor Carr
SECONDED by Councillor Reimer
WHEREAS
1. Waste from single-use items such as shopping bags, disposable cups, take-out
containers, straws and utensils is generated in large quantities, requires a
significant amount of resources to produce, is not often reused or recycled, is a
significant component of street and shoreline litter, takes up valuable space in
landfills, and costs municipal taxpayers millions of dollars to collect from public
waste bins and litter;
2. Local governments can work on diversion and management of materials but the
provincial government has more powers to influence what kinds of materials are
used, the volume of those materials and reductions of those volumes as well as
the power to regulate extended producer responsibility programs;
3. British Columbia’s extended producer responsibility program for packaging and
paper products includes recyclable single-use items generated by residents and
in the public realm, but not compostable single-use items or single-use items
generated by the industrial, commercial and institutional (ICI) sector.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Vancouver City Council submit the following to
the Union of BC Municipalities (UBCM) 2018 Convention:
THAT the Province of British Columbia develop a provincial Single-Use Item
Reduction Strategy as part of a provincial Zero Waste Strategy, which would
include but not necessarily be limited to plastic and paper shopping bags,
polystyrene foam cups and polystyrene foam containers, other hot and cold drink
cups and take-out containers, straws and utensils, but would exclude all single
use items needed for medical use or for people with disabilities.

2. Supporting a Comprehensive Public Health Response to the Ongoing Opioid
Crisis in British Columbia
MOVED by Councillor Jang
SECONDED by Councillor Louie
THAT the following motion be submitted to the Union of British Columbia Municipalities
for the 2018 convention:

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, Tuesday, June 19, 2018 34
WHEREAS
1. The ongoing opioid crisis has taken the lives of over 2,800 residents of British
Columbia since January of 2016, eclipsing annual deaths from suicide, motor
vehicle incidents, and homicides combined, with Indigenous communities
overrepresented amongst those that died from an overdose and Indigenous
women more likely than non-Indigenous women to die from an overdose;
2. Partners in provincial and local governments, health, public safety, and
community continue to take significant efforts to curb this loss of life, the crisis
has been driven by an increasingly deadly and unregulated drug supply that
includes fentanyl and other toxic substances that continues to result in a high
number of overdose deaths, and while the health system continues to take
significant afford to treat people living with addictions, the unregulated supply
remains a significant hazard for the population at large.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT the Union of British Columbia Municipalities
write to the Prime Minister, Federal Ministers of Health, Justice, and Public Safety and
Emergency Preparedness, urging the Government of Canada to support a
comprehensive and culturally safe public health approach to the ongoing opioid crisis,
beginning with the implementation of low-barrier opioid distribution programs for those
most at risk for overdose death whilst initiating a review process for Canada’s legislative,
regulatory, and policy frameworks governing illegal drugs to move towards a
comprehensive regulatory framework for all illegal substances across Canada

Provincial Assessment and Tax Reform
MOVED by Councillor Louie
SECONDED by Councillor Deal
THAT the following motion be submitted to the Union of British Columbia Municipalities

WHEREAS the widespread land speculation and soaring assessments on
commercial and industrial properties continue to pose significant affordability
challenges to independent small businesses who have limited ability to absorb
extraordinary increases in rent and assume all property taxes passed on to them
by their landlords, including taxes on the development potential; and
WHEREAS Vancouver City Council has formally submitted a request to the
Province of BC in February 2018 to initiate a Province-led intergovernmental
workgroup to assess the options put forward by the City of Vancouver to address
the impact of soaring property assessments on independent small business
tenants in time for the 2019 tax year. The City of Vancouver has not formally
heard back from the Province of BC to-date;

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, Tuesday, June 19, 2018 35
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Vancouver City Council call on the Union
of BC Municipalities (UBCM) to request the Province of British Columbia to
initiate a Province-led intergovernmental workgroup to address these
assessment and taxation issues immediately to enable the long-term viability of
independent small businesses in Metro Vancouver and the rest of British
Columbia.
