October 24, 2019, the Committee concluded hearing from speakers and referred discussion and
decision of the above-noted item to the Regular Council meeting on November 5, 2019, as
Unfinished Business.
MOVED by Councillor Fry
SECONDED by Councillor Dominato
WHEREAS
1. Fireworks are dangerous explosive items that can burn up to 1000 degrees
Celsius and create loud noises in the range of 150db. Safety guidelines
published by Natural Resources Canada requires a minimum 30m x 30m (100’ x
100’) clear space be used when setting off fireworks. The typical Vancouver lot is
only 10 m wide;
2. Consumer fireworks are a popular form of fireworks used for recreation, they
include noisemakers, ground spinners, sparklers and aerial fireworks. Display
Fireworks are fireworks designed to be used by professionals;1
3. Each year, Vancouver Police Department calls for service dramatically increase
during the five days leading up to October 31st. In a 2018 memo, Vancouver Fire
and Rescue Services compiled damages and cost over the last 12 years and
found that the average fire loss per year due to the use of consumer fireworks is
$379,000.00;
4. Vancouver is one of the only local cities that allow the sale and use of consumer
fireworks. Nearby cities that have banned fireworks due to excessive property
damage, injuries and costs to the communities include North Vancouver,
Coquitlam, Port Coquitlam, Pitt Meadows, Maple Ridge, Richmond, Delta,
Surrey, Langley, Langley Township, Abbotsford, Mission, Victoria, and Seattle
WA;
5. In 2007 Council approved amendments to the Fire By-law to restrict the purchase
and discharge of fireworks to individuals holding a permit issued by the Fire
Chief. The City of Vancouver fire bylaw currently restricts the sale of fireworks
except between October 25th and October 31st of each calendar year. Permit
holders must be 19 years of age or older and successfully complete the fire
department (on line) education and test regarding handling of fireworks;

Minutes, November 5, 2019 15
6. Fireworks set off in urban areas have demonstrable and significant adverse
effect on wild animals.2 Research studies show that the noise from fireworks
causes a great amount of fear, stress and anxiety in wild animals. Other
documented effects include nesting birds and other small mammal parents
abandoning their nests leaving their defenseless babies behind. The panic can
sometimes cause so much disorientation that wildlife parents cannot locate their
nests and their babies die. Panic and disorientation from fireworks noise has also
resulted in birds flying into windows and buildings, or too far out to sea to escape
the noise;3
7. Fireworks set off in urban areas have demonstrable and significant adverse
effect on many domestic animals. In 2016 a mixed breed dog named Maggie was
killed 4 when spooked by fireworks she ran onto SkyTrain tracks. Each year the
BCSPCA issue warnings to public to protect and calm pets traumatized by
fireworks. Animal shelters typically see an increase in lost animals during
fireworks sessions and Veterinary Associations caution many animals injure
themselves in panicked attempts to escape the blasts;
8. Fireworks have environmental impacts though the release of poisonous
chemicals and airborne particles, including colourants and propellants like
copper, strontium, lithium, barium, aluminum, potassium and percholates.
Research has found that fireworks sourced airborne particulates have been
found to deplete lung defences more than pollution from traffic sources. Spent
fireworks particles and detritus make their wat into our waterways, atmosphere
and environment; 5 6
9. Fireworks can trigger PTSD for survivors of gun violence, war refugees, and
veterans; 7 8
10. Fireworks-related injuries disproportionally impact children and youth. In 2017,
eight people died and over 12,000 were injured badly enough to require medical
treatment in the United States, 50% of those casualties were to children and
youth under twenty; 9
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to work with Vancouver Fire
and Rescue Services and the Vancouver Police Department to report back in 2020 on a
plan to ban the retail sale of consumer fireworks to the public by 2021. Considerations
should include:
i. How to address enforcement and compliance with a ban on consumer
fireworks;
ii. Exemptions for how display fireworks can still be used as part of large
public events (Celebration of Light, New Year’s Eve etc.) and
cultural/religious occasions (Diwali etc.);
iii. An authorized Fire permit from the City of Vancouver to ignite, explode,
set off or detonate display fireworks within the guidelines and conditions

FINAL MOTION AS APPROVED
WHEREAS
1. Fireworks are dangerous explosive items that can burn up to 1000 degrees
Celsius and create loud noises in the range of 150db. Safety guidelines
published by Natural Resources Canada requires a minimum 30m x 30m (100’ x
100’) clear space be used when setting off fireworks. The typical Vancouver lot is
only 10 m wide;
2. Consumer fireworks are a popular form of fireworks used for recreation, they
include noisemakers, ground spinners, sparklers and aerial fireworks. Display
Fireworks are fireworks designed to be used by professionals;1
3. Each year, Vancouver Police Department calls for service dramatically increase
during the five days leading up to October 31st. In a 2018 memo, Vancouver Fire
and Rescue Services compiled damages and cost over the last 12 years and
found that the average fire loss per year due to the use of consumer fireworks is
$379,000.00;

Council Meeting
Minutes, November 5, 2019 18
4. Vancouver is one of the only local cities that allow the sale and use of consumer
fireworks. Nearby cities that have banned fireworks due to excessive property
damage, injuries and costs to the communities include North Vancouver,
Coquitlam, Port Coquitlam, Pitt Meadows, Maple Ridge, Richmond, Delta,
Surrey, Langley, Langley Township, Abbotsford, Mission, Victoria, and Seattle
WA;

3. Four Pillars Drug Strategy Review and Additional Resources
At the reconvened Standing Committee on Policy and Strategic Priorities meeting on October
24, 2019, due to time constraints, the Committee referred discussion and decision of the
above-noted item to the Regular Council meeting on November 5, 2019, as Unfinished
Business.
MOVED by Councillor De Genova
SECONDED by Councillor Dominato
WHEREAS
1. The Four Pillars Drug Strategy was introduced at Vancouver Citiy Council in the
1990s by former City of Vancouver Mayor Philip Owen;
2. In 1998, Council approved “A Program of Strategic Actions for the Downtown
Eastside” which included developing directions for the City to address substance
misuse issues in the Downtown Eastside and the city;
3. Based on policy and research gathered from exploring models in European cities
(Frankfurt, Geneva, Zurich) in the United Kingdom (Liverpool), Australia (Sydney)
and U.S.A. (Portland, Oregon) on April 24, 2001, Council officially adopted a
revised framework and policy recommendations “A Framework for action: A Four
Pillar Approach to Vancouver’s Drug Problems”;
4. The Four Pillars Drug Strategy includes:

Council Meeting
Minutes, November 5, 2019 20
• Harm Reduction
• Prevention
• Treatment
• Enforcement
5. Vancouver is world renowned for implementation of the Four Pillars Strategy and
exploring new clinical trials, programs and approaches to address drug policy.
Listed below are examples:
i) InSite opened September 21, 2003, in Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside
and is the first supervised injection facility in North America. InSite is
managed by Vancouver Coastal Health and over the years it has proved
to be successful in several ways including reducing overdose fatalities,
reducing the transmission of blood-born infections like HIV and Hepatitis
C, increasing referral and connections with community and health
programs;
ii) The North American Opiate Medication Initiative (NAOMI) Study was
approved by Health Canada and funded by Canadian Institutes of health
research. A Vancouver clinical trial began with enrollment of 192
volunteers in 2005 and enrollment concluded in 2007. The objective of
this clinical trial was to test if heroin-assisted therapy benefits people
suffering from chronic opiate addictions who have not benefited from
other treatments. Clinical Trials were also conducted in Montreal and
Quebec City;
iii) The Study to Assess Longer-term Opioid Medication Effectiveness
(SALOME) enrolled 202 volunteers for a clinical trial study beginning in
2011 with study completion in 2016. SALOME endeavored to compare
two medications- diacetylmorphine (active ingredient in heroin) and
hydromorphone;
6. The City of Vancouver and Mayor and Council over several terms and of different
political affiliations have supported the Four Pillars Drug Strategy, updating
actions in the strategy to address current and emerging community needs;
7. Overdose Prevention Sites and Drug Checking Services have expanded in
Vancouver, providing clients at Insite and individuals using the Overdose
Prevention Society Site and others the ability to test drugs for fentanyl and other
substances. A Vancouver Coastal Health (VCH) media release in 2017
announced 4 locations and the Powell Street Getaway, offering a Fourier-
Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FTIR), which can identify multiple ingredients
in drugs;
8. April 14, 2016 the overdose crisis was declared a public health emergency in
British Columbia and in the province over 3,600 people have lost their lives
because of overdose;

Council Meeting
Minutes, November 5, 2019 21
9. December 20, 2018, a Special Council meeting was held for “Mayor’s Overdose
Emergency Task Force –Recommendations for Immediate Action on the
Overdose Crisis”. The following language carried in a Council amendment:
THAT Council direct staff to explore how all pillars of the Four Pillars Drug
Strategy have been applied to the overdose crisis since the Provincial Medical
Health Officer declared a public health emergency under the Public Health Act on
April 14, 2016, and report back in Q3 of 2019;
10. In July 2019, Council approved a safe supply statement and recommended
resolution for FCM to “call on the federal government to expand access to safe
supply by proactively supporting all doctors, health authorities, provinces and all
relevant professional colleges, including physicians and surgeons across
Canada, to safely provide regulated opioids or other substances through a free
and federally available Pharmacare program.” In September 2019, a resolution
passed at FCM in support of initiatives to support and fast-track safe supply for
municipalities;
11. Portugal has adopted an innovative model setting their system apart, including
decriminalization of illicit drugs for users found carrying personal supply (for up to
10 days). The system has similar objectives to the Four Pillars Drug Strategy.
Like restorative justice, the “Commission for the Dissuasion of Drug Addiction”
offers a different approach to enforcement. There is also access to a long-term
safe supply for chronic opioid users, who can be connected to ongoing treatment
and community support. The Portugal model is measured by data and success-
including a significant reduction in overdose related deaths, the cost of
incarceration, healthcare and property crime;
12. Although the City of Vancouver has expressed the need for increased treatment
options, access to treatment is limited and waitlists can be ineffective and long
for people facing addition.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT, in the interest of moving forward with a comprehensive review and the
ongoing of the Four Pillars Drug Strategy, Council direct staff to increase
resources and the capacity of city staff to research drug policy;
FURTHER THAT the City manager administer and organize staff and resources,
to increase the capacity of Arts, Culture and Community Services to research a
new drug policy to further achieve the goals of the Four Pillars Drug Strategy;
AND FURTHER THAT that this be implemented as soon as possible and no later
than the 2021 City of Vancouver operating budget cycle.
B. THAT Council direct staff to investigate and report back on the possibility of
implementing “new to Vancouver initiatives”, that have proven to be successful in
drug policy strategy approved by federal parliament in Portugal;

Council Meeting
Minutes, November 5, 2019 22
FURTHER THAT any recommendations that may be brought forward, are in the
spirit of The Four Pillars Drug Strategy and the Healthy City Strategy.

THAT Council add the following as C:
THAT the City formalize the Vancouver Police Department’s de-facto policy

2. Safe and Inclusive Streets: Support for Community Crisis Management through
Understanding and De-escalation
Councillor De Genova rose on a point of order asking if the motion was in order as some of the
language seems redundant to what staff are already working on.
After a short recess, the Mayor ruled the motion in order.
MOVED by Councillor Fry
SECONDED by Councillor Dominato
WHEREAS
1. Jane Jacobs famously posited: “The public peace—the sidewalk and street
peace—of cities is not kept primarily by the police, necessary as police are. It is
kept primarily by an intricate, almost unconscious, network of voluntary controls
and standards among the people themselves, and enforced by the people
themselves”; 1
2. Today, the complex relationship of gentrification and inclusion; poverty;
homelessness; mental health and addiction have emerged as a crisis all along
the West Coast and specifically Downtown Vancouver. This crisis often manifests
in conflict: Concerns around crime and safety, neighbourhood decline, and
chronic street nuisance. These conflicts in turn result in higher volumes of police
and non-emergency calls, calls for more security and pro-active engagement,
and compassion fatigue;
3. Chronic street nuisance is a particular and highly visible symptom of the larger
crisis and can been defined as conditions that (1) violate community norms

Council Meeting
Minutes, November 5, 2019 36
governing proper conduct in a particular public space (2) over a protracted period
of time (3) to the minor annoyance of passersby. A person perpetrates a chronic
street nuisance by persistently acting in a public space in a manner that violates
prevailing community standards of behavior, to the significant cumulative
annoyance of persons of ordinary sensibility who use the same spaces; 2
4. In 2019, Vancouver’s homelessness count was 2,223 people (up two per cent
from 2018), with 614 people living on the street; 3
5. Street entrenched and homeless people have often experienced trauma
including intergenerational and childhood trauma; sexual and physical
victimization; physical or mental health issues and addictions; compounded by
the trauma of living on the street or in substandard housing and of social
isolation; 4
6. First responders, non-profits, outreach workers, as well as shelter and housing
providers are all variously trained in some form of de-escalation techniques
through non-violent crisis intervention instruction and trauma-informed
workshops;
7. Increasingly the private sector, including BIAs and security providers 5, 6 are
learning de-escalation techniques through non-violent crisis intervention
instruction and trauma-informed workshops, and offering instruction to their
members. For example: Toronto’s Downtown Yonge BIA 9 holds information
sessions (faciltated by the Canadian Mental Health Association) for business
owners and managers who want to learn more about techniques for de-
escalation when individuals enter their establishments in distress;
8. Many businesses and residents of Downtown Vancouver find themselves ill-
equipped for any sort of community crisis management or de-escalation, and
amidst increasing reports of conflict surrounding chronic street nuisance and
disorder, many Vancouverites don’t know who to call, how to help or get help;
9. In 2014, Vancouver City Council adopted the Caring for All Report 8 with the
following call to action: “The City clearly has a responsibility to support and
advocate for safe and inclusive communities for all residents… By making use of
its full range of social development tools, from advocacy to direct services, the
City is well positioned to support partnerships to help transform existing services
and approaches in the arena of mental health and addictions. As experienced
over the last year in the work of the Task Force, the City can also play an
important convening role to bring partners and citizens together to address
complex issues”;
10. In 2014, Vancouver City Council adopted A Healthy City For All strategy 9 with a
clear vision statement and within one of its three main areas of focus Healthy
Communities - Cultivating Connections, a clear call to action to Examine
regulations, policies, and processes that affect our relationships with and
between residents - past, present and future.

Council Meeting
Minutes, November 5, 2019 37
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Vancouver City Council commit to safe and inclusive streets and
communities for enjoyment and use of all residents.
B. THAT Council direct staff to reach out to relevant partner agencies including
Vancouver Coast Health, Vancouver Police Department, Canadian Mental Health
Association, Ministry of Mental Health and Addictions, and others (including
community groups, peer supporters and BIAs) as applicable to develop a
workplan by Q2 2020 for a collaborative strategy around community engagement
for responding to and managing street disorder.
C. THAT a strategy of community engagement for responding to and managing
street disorder:
i. is inclusive and accessible, rooted in compassion and mutual
understanding;
ii. is informed by best practices and lived experience;
iii. is rooted in non-violent crisis intervention and de-escalation;
iv. provides participants a better understanding of issues around mental
health and trauma;
v. considers place-making opportunities to counter impressions and
incidence of chronic street nuisance; and
vi. reduces call volumes for police response, while redirecting more
appropriate resources as applicable.

3. Exploring a More Robust Policy Framework Relating to the Sale and Promotion of
Vaping Products
MOVED by Councillor Bligh
SECONDED by Councillor Dominato
WHEREAS
1. There has been a noticeable increase in the number of Vancouver retailers
selling vape equipment and supplies over the past few years amid calls to limit,
or even ban, vaping products and their promotion given serious concerns
regarding the health risks associated with vaping, particularly the advertising of
vaping products which often targets minors and youth;
2. The City of Vancouver does not currently impose any specific restrictions on the
sale of vape equipment and supplies, for example, there is no minimum distance
requirement between retailers of vaping equipment and supplies as is the case
for liquor stores and cannabis retailers, nor does the City have a license category
specific to retailers who sell vape products;
3. The BC Lung Association notes that although the long-term health effects of
using vaping products are currently unknown and under scientific examination,
the “Short-term health effects include coughing, sneezing, exacerbation in
asthma symptoms and increased heart rate” are known;
4. On September 4, 2019, in the wake of reported cases of severe pulmonary
illness and a number of deaths associated with the use of vaping products in the
United States, Health Canada advised Canadians who use vaping products to

Council Meeting
Minutes, November 5, 2019 39
monitor themselves for symptoms of pulmonary illness (e.g., cough, shortness of
breath, chest pain) and to seek medical attention promptly if they have concerns
about their health;
5. On Sept. 19, 2019, Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.’s provincial health officer, issued a
notice under the Reporting Information Affecting Public Health Regulation that
requires physicians to report incidences of patients exhibiting symptoms that
meet the national case definition for vaping-related illness;
6. On Wednesday, October 16, 2019, Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.’s provincial health
officer, confirmed the first probable case of a vaping-related illness in B.C., noting
“several other investigations [are] underway that may also meet the case
definition of probable or confirmed vaping-related illness in the near future”;
7. Dr. Bonnie Henry, B.C.’s provincial health officer, has also stated that vaping “is
quickly emerging as a significant public health issue, [and]… turning back the
clock on decades of effective anti-smoking efforts and creating a new generation
of young people addicted to nicotine”;
8. Vancouver Coastal Health has reported seeing “the classic signs of nicotine
addiction in young people who vape” (i.e., they can’t concentrate in school,
they’re irritable, and they don’t recognize they are experiencing nicotine
withdrawal) and further stated that there is “a limited window of opportunity to
reach young people who use e-cigarettes” given that studies show 99 percent of
people who become addicted to nicotine do so before the age of 26 while the
brain is still developing;
9. Vancouver Coastal Health (VCH) is responsible for the enforcement of provincial
regulations governing sales of tobacco and vape products in Vancouver;
10. For its part, Vancouver Coastal Health has expressed grave concern that the
“young e-cigarette users of today don’t know the risks of vaping, and could
become the tobacco smokers of tomorrow,” while also noting that although the
long term health effects of vaping are not known, it is known that the chemicals in
some products are not safe when inhaled and that anyone near someone vaping
can also be affected by the vapour;
11. The BC Lung Association makes note of several studies that suggest the health
effects of vaping can be similar to those of cigarette smoking and also notes that
there have been cases of children and adults poisoned by swallowing the e-juice
or absorbing it through their skin;
12. Vancouver Coastal Health notes on its website that “Vaping products, like vape
pens and e-cigarettes, may contain:
• Nicotine
• Volatile Organic Compounds (also found in gasoline)
• Carbonyls (also found in embalming liquid)
• Tiny particles (also found in wildfire smoke)

• Toxic heavy metals such as chromium, nickel and lead
• Flavours (e-juice)
13. Vancouver Coastal Health advises that there are currently 479 retailers in
Vancouver that fall under the purview of VCH’s Tobacco Enforcement Program:
• 232 – sell tobacco and vape products
• 149 – sell tobacco exclusively
• 33 – sell vape products exclusively
• 65 – Liquor premises that sell tobacco and/or vape products
14. The federal Tobacco and Vaping Products Act distinguishes between “tobacco”
and “vape” products and specifically allows – at present – for advertising vape
products as long as the advertisements meet the criteria stipulated in the
legislation and regulations. This has resulted in TransLink being unable to
prohibit vape advertisements that meet the legal and regulatory requirements;
15. An increasing number of B.C. municipalities and school districts are calling for a
policy framework that is more robust than at present to address the many issues
related to vaping and vape products and they are taking steps – where they can
– to address these issues within their jurisdictional purview while also calling on
the provincial and federal governments to take actions appropriate to their
jurisdictional powers and responsibilities, for example:
• Richmond city councillors recently voted unanimously to ban
advertisements for vaping products on sites and property the City owns
and/or has sufficient control over, including transit shelters, transit
benches, and other street furniture, to bring attention to the serious health
risks associated with vaping, particularly for youth and minors who are
often the target audience of vape advertising.
• Trustees in the Fraser Cascade School District (SD78) recently voted
unanimously to send a letter to the Minister of Health asking the province
to ban flavoured vaping products, bring in tighter retail controls, develop
educational tools to stop students from vaping in the first place, and the
creation of tougher penalties for non-compliance.
• In April, Coquitlam City council asked their staff to find ways the city can
help to prevent children from obtaining vape products, while noting that
local governments have limited powers and jurisdiction to protect youth
from accessing vaping products or the appeal of vape products, including
an absence of resources for enforcement. More recently, Coquitlam City
council voted unanimously to support a motion asking the Federation of
Canadian Municipalities and UBCM to call upon Health Canada and the
provincial and territorial governments “to move quickly to coordinate
additional public policy and regulations to address access, sale and
appeal of vape products to youth, and offer additional enforcement

Minutes, November 5, 2019 41
resources, to halt the growing usage of vape products among our youth
as a matter of concern to local government and their communities.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to explore various regulatory measures and actions
within the City’s jurisdictional powers, either through the Vancouver Charter or
other relevant legislation, as a step toward the establishment of a more robust
policy framework relating to the sale and promotion of vaping products in
Vancouver, and for staff to report back to Council before the end of Q1 in 2020
with recommendations and options for Council’s consideration including (but not
limited to):
• Measures to limit the proximity of vape retailers to schools, youth-oriented
facilities, and other recreation facilities, parks, and libraries etc.
frequented by youth,
• Measures to ban advertisements for vaping products on sites and
properties the City owns and/or has sufficient control over, including
transit shelters, transit benches, and other street furniture etc.
• Changes to the City’s sponsorship policy as it pertains to tobacco
products to include vape products etc.
B. THAT Council empower and otherwise direct the Mayor, on behalf of City
Council, to write to the provincial Minister of Health in support of a ban on
flavoured vaping products, as well as calling on the province to bring in tighter
retail controls on vaping products, to set tougher penalties for non-compliance,
and to develop educational tools to stop students from vaping in the first place,
including any other measures that would serve to avert the serious health
impacts and public policy implications that vaping and vape products represent to
B.C. and B.C.’s communities.
C. THAT Council empower and otherwise direct the Mayor, on behalf of City
Council, to write to the Prime Minister of Canada and the federal Minister
responsible for the Tobacco and Vaping Products Act urging them to amend the
Act and all relevant regulations to restrict the advertisement of vape products as
is the case with limits to advertising tobacco products.
D. THAT Council direct staff to communicate with their staff counterparts at the
Vancouver School Board, the Vancouver Park Board, and Vancouver Coastal
Health to offer support for any initiatives they may undertake or be undertaking in
relation to vaping and vape products; and
FURTHER THAT staff report back to Council on any initiatives that the
Vancouver School Board, the Vancouver Park Board, and/or Vancouver Coastal
Health may be contemplating in relation to vaping and vape products with an eye
to potential partnerships.

Council Meeting
Minutes, November 5, 2019 42
E. THAT Council direct staff to reach out to their staff counterparts in other B.C.
communities where there is concern about the impacts of vaping and vaping
products in order to signal and offer the City of Vancouver’s support for a
coordinated Federation of Canadian Municipalities effort and a coordinated
UBCM effort to call on Health Canada and the provincial and territorial
governments to move quickly on additional public policy and related regulations
to address the sale, access, and appeal of vape products to youth, and for the
federal, provincial, and territorial governments to consider providing additional
enforcement resources to local governments to halt the growing use of vape
products among youth as per the grave health concerns this issue has for local
governments and their respective communities.
REFERRAL MOVED by Councillor De Genova
SECONDED by Councillor Boyle
THAT Council refer the Motion “Exploring a More Robust Policy Framework Relating to
the Sale and Promotion of Vaping Products” to the Standing Committee on City Finance
and Services meeting on November 6, 2019, in order to hear from speakers.
CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY (Vote No. 05122)
6. Increasing Access for Emergency Services: Examining How the City of Vancouver
Can Increase Access to Strata and Rental Multi-Residential Buildings for All
Emergency Services
MOVED by Councillor De Genova
SECONDED by Councillor Bligh
WHEREAS:
1. In June 2014 the Vancouver Police Department announced the launch of Project
Access “to assist Vancouverites in getting the police resources they need in the
event of an emergency”. The project included a voluntary partnership between
building management and the VPD to secure a method of entry to allow police
access to residential condominium and rental buildings in the event of an
emergency;
2. Vancouver Fire and Rescue Services are able to access multi-residential
buildings via a lockbox that allows fire-fighters and rescue workers to enter
buildings without causing extra damage during an emergency;
3. Richmond RCMP can gain access to multi-family residential buildings that opt
into the City of Richmond Voluntary Building Access Program, using an
electronic signal for building access. A media release from RCMP dated March
23, 2017, confirms the planned solution includes “a Bluetooth-enabled lockbox
that uses a smartphone to open the box where keys or key fobs can be stored.
And should the smartphone get lost, in addition to requiring a passcode to open

Council Meeting
Minutes, November 5, 2019 43
the app, the app itself can be removed from the device remotely, adding
increased security. Further, every time the box is opened with the smartphone, a
transaction gets sent to a database that's managed by the fire department. While
typical lockboxes are surface-mounted to the wall, this one is flush-mounted,
making it virtually impenetrable”;
4. Currently, police officers and paramedics do not have the same level of access
as Vancouver Fire and Rescue Services;
5. There have been emergency situations in the City of Vancouver where
paramedics and police have required access to buildings;
6. British Columbia Ambulance Service (BCAS) and the Vancouver Police
Department both respond to a variety of situations, examples include: emergency
mental health issues, suicide attempts, domestic violence, serious medical
emergencies requiring medical attention and transport to hospital. Response time
and the ability of emergency services to access multi-residential buildings can
greatly affect and be a determining factor in the outcome of emergency calls.
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED:
A. THAT Council direct staff to explore options available to the City of Vancouver to
increase access and/or require new multi-family residential buildings to grant
access to all Emergency Services in emergency circumstances.
B. THAT Council direct staff to consider ways to encourage existing strata and
rental buildings to opt into programs allowing access to all emergency services in
Vancouver.
C. THAT staff report back to Council with possible recommendations as soon as
possible, and no later than Q4 2021.

4. An Opportunity to Participate in a Partnered Campaign Focussed on Responsible
Alcohol Consumption
MOVED by Councillor Dominato
SECONDED by Councillor De Genova
WHEREAS
1. On January 29, 2019, Council directed City staff to work with EasyPark to
explore the potential to expand the “Park Until” option to the City’s parkades
managed by EasyPark;
2. In accordance with Council’s January 2019 direction to staff, an October 16,
2019, memo distributed to members of Council by the City Manager notes that
there are 30 City-controlled parking lots where “Park Until” functionality is
applicable and further states that “Park Until” functionality has been, or soon will
be, implemented at all of these City-controlled parking lots where “Park Until”
functionality is applicable via one of the three parking apps EasyPark accepts
(i.e., EasyPark app, Honk Mobile, PayByPhone) or via the on-site parking meter;
3. Council’s January 2019 direction to staff also included a request for staff to
recommend low-cost or no-cost ways to promote and incentivize responsible
transportation choices (including expanded “Park Until” options at the City’s
EasyPark parkades) for those who may have consumed more alcohol or other
substances than expected, including opportunities to work with other partners in
the interest of public safety;
4. City staff have identified a number of low cost and no cost ways to promote and
incentivize responsible transportation choices in relation to Council’s January
2019 direction and have noted in their memo that the City’s most economical way
to achieve this goal is by leveraging existing assets and systems to help promote
public awareness (e.g., the City’s social media channels);
5. Staff have also identified a low-cost opportunity for the City to participate in a
partnered campaign focused on responsible alcohol consumption during the
holiday season that would launch in December of this year and would require the
City to bear some of the costs to develop associated print materials (estimated to
be approximately $3,500) that would then be featured on available wall space at
EasyPark lots and parkades;
6. Staff have advised that if Council wishes the City to participate in the above-
mentioned partnered awareness campaign during the 2019 holiday season,
Council should provide direction for staff to do so as soon as possible to allow for
proper preparation.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to proceed with the
opportunity they have identified for the City to participate in a low cost partnered
campaign focused on responsible alcohol consumption, which will launch in December
of this year during the holiday season, with approximately $7,000 in City funds to be

allocated to cover some of the costs associated with the development of the related print
materials and featured on available wall space at EasyPark lots and parkades, all as
noted in the October 16, 2019, staff memo distributed to members of Council by the City
Manager;
FURTHER THAT any information that can be gleaned from subsequent evaluations of
this initiative and the “Park Until” option, specific to the question of whether people are
availing themselves of the “Park Until” option due to intoxication or for other reasons, be
made available to City of Vancouver stakeholders such as Vancouver Coastal Health.
