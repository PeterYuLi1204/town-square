THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. Trans, Gender Diverse and Two-Spirit (TGD2S) individuals are important
members of our community who deserve to be safe and deserve equitable
opportunities to belong and thrive in Vancouver. However, TGD2S communities
are facing increased levels of hatred and harassment that is putting their safety
and wellbeing at risk;
2. In 2016, following extensive community consultation, Vancouver City Council
adopted a Trans, Gender-Diverse and Two-Spirit Inclusion Strategy. A key theme
of the 2016 strategy was that “Changes Require Long-term Commitment”

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, November 29, 2023 8
emphasizing that change includes integrating TGD2S recommendations into
current equity and inclusion strategies, and pursuing intentional measures
specific to the TGD2S community;
3. A 2020 memo updating City Council on implementation of the TDG2S Inclusion
Strategy and Women’s Equity Strategy highlighted the completion of Phase One
of the strategy and stated that Phase Two intended to look specifically at
systemic barriers to apply an intersectional approach to gender equity, with
ongoing “vigilance, learning, growth, and action.”;
4. Since the adoption and implementation of the 2016 TGD2S Inclusion Strategy,
the social and cultural context for the TGD2S community has shifted significantly.
There has been increased visibility, public awareness and understanding of the
diversity of gender expressions, thanks to courageous leadership from trans and
queer communities. There has also been significant backlash;
5. Hostility toward TGD2S people has been on the rise in Canada and BC, fueled
by a widespread and organized campaign of misinformation and fearmongering.
This rise in hostility is happening despite gender identity, expression and sexual
orientation being protected personal characteristics under the BC Human Rights
Code;
6. In September 2023, harmful and at times violent rallies were held around Greater
Vancouver and across the country against SOGI (sexual orientation and gender
identity) inclusive education. These rallies were met with significant counter
protests from trans and queer communities and their allies;
7. Educational policies and procedures that reference SOGI seek to address
bullying, and foster inclusion and acceptance for all youth. SOGI initiatives are
proven to reduce discrimination, suicidal ideation and suicide attempts for
students who identify as 2SLGBTQIA+ and research shows that these positive
outcomes also extend to cisgender and heterosexual youth, too;
8. 60% of sexual minorities in Canada have experienced physical or sexual assault
in their life times. In 2020 alone, 259 people in Canada from 2SLGBTQIA+
communities reported targeted hate crimes based on their sexual orientation –
the highest rate since 2009. Hate crimes against minority communities are often
under-reported;
9. In BC, 1 in 4 queer and trans youth are forced out of their homes due to severe
family conflict. 29% of trans people often report being turned away when trying to
access shelters with nearly a quarter of those reporting being assaulted by
shelter residents and staff. Within this group, people of colour and Indigenous
peoples often fare worse;
10. Newcomer and migrant 2SLGBTQIA+ communities face additional barriers to
inclusion and safety upon their arrival and integration into life in Vancouver.
Accessible resources on SOGI and TGD2S rights are often only offered in a
limited range of languages making cross cultural conversations more difficult;

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, November 29, 2023 9
11. November 20th is Transgender Day of Remembrance, an initiative started by
transgender advocate Gwendolyn Ann Smith as a vigil to honour the memory of
Rita Hester, a transgender woman who was killed in 1998. Communities around
the world now host vigils on November 20 to honour all those trans, gender
diverse and two-spirit people whose lives were lost to anti-trans violence that
year;
12. In June 2023 Council received an Equity Framework Implementation Update.
The report stated that most of the actions from Vancouver’s 2016 TGD2S
Inclusion policy have been implemented or are underway, and that “there has not
been much progress to report on since the March 2020 update to Council”. The
report also recognized that “the context of the TGD2S community has evolved
over the past seven years since the initial work was done”; and
13. The above mentioned 2023 report outlined that while many other elements of the
equity framework implementation were going well or exceeding expectations,
“work on women, trans and gender-diverse communities is being flagged as
being in need of renewal.”
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council commit to the creation and implementation of a renewed Trans,
Gender Diverse and Two-Spirit (TGD2S) Action Plan with a focus on inclusion
and safety;
FURTHER THAT Council direct staff to engage with community leaders and
organisations to inform next steps, and report back with a draft work plan and
goals by July 2024.
B. THAT Council direct staff to ensure that any action plans, resources, and
community engagement activities are available in multiple languages to
encourage engagement from diverse language communities.
C. THAT Council direct staff to include suggested funding for this work as an
amendment to the 2024 budget.

The Committee heard from one speaker in support of the motion.

SECONDED by Councillor Carr
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
7 2023 Equity Framework Implementation Update to Council. Available at:
https://council.vancouver.ca/20230628/documents/pspc1.pdf

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, November 29, 2023 13
1. The City of Vancouver is responsible for building and maintaining roads and
public right of ways through the provision of surfacing, ice and hazard clearance,
and road markings;
2. Road marking paints play a crucial role in maintaining safety and order on our
roadways. Drivers, active transportation users and pedestrians alike, all rely on
these markings for guidance, to inform of potential hazards, and regulate traffic
flow. The presence and visibility of pavement marking paints help reduce
collisions, confusion, and congestion;
3. Vision Zero, the international strategy to eliminate all traffic fatalities and severe
injuries, through systemic road (re)design and addressing issues proactively
before collisions, considers improved pavement markings as one important tool
in the toolbox, a “quick build” solution to enhance road safety at (relatively) low
cost. According to the 2022 cost references compiled by Vision Zero Network
and 3M, the average cost of a new “continental crosswalk” (aka zebra) is $7.50
USD / sq ft.;
4. Road marking paints are durable, highly reflective raised markers that are impact
resistant and suitable for all weather conditions and road surfaces. Since the
federal ban on oil-based paints in 2010, paints today are typically comprised of
thermoplastic compounds, synthetic resin, glass beads, pigments, and fillers like
limestone and sand for anti-skid properties. Paints are applied hot with
specialized equipment to promote fast drying and strong adhesion to the road
surface;
5. Road marking paints are critical for defining and delineating:
a. Hazards, stop lines, yields, medians, slow streets, sped limits, and
wayfinding,
b. Traffic lines, turning lanes, direction of flow, merging, and lane changing,
c. Pedestrian walkways, crossings, elephant’s feet, and zebra crosswalks,
d. Bike routes, unprotected bike lanes and boxes,
e. Bus zones and HOV lanes, and
f. Parking zones and restrictions;
6. Road marking paints are susceptible to more rapid wear due to high traffic
volumes, heavier vehicles, and increasing impacts of climate change including
damage caused variously by extreme heats, heavier rainfalls, and snow/ice
removal that require abrasive and corrosive application of ploughs, sand and salt.
Once the surface is damaged, water egress can further damage the substrate,
especially during freezing and thawing;
7. Damaged paint resulting in incomplete or degraded road markings can create
compromised visibility for all road users, especially in rainy or dark conditions,
and for active transportation users can further result in uneven surfaces that
create potential surface hazards in particular for cyclists and micromobility road
users;

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, November 29, 2023 14
8. Various reports, social media posts and anecdotes suggest road and crosswalk
visibility remain a hazard that is top of mind for many Vancouverites;
9. Many Canadian cities and provinces have regular scheduled full or (more
typically) partial rotating road marking re-painting programs to proactively
address wear and tear on surfacing, prevent substrate damage, and promote
greater visibility and safety; and
10. The City of Vancouver does not have a dedicated regularized program for road
marking paint maintenance and instead resurfaces road markings on an as need
ad hoc basis.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to report back with a
regularized road marking maintenance plan, considering wear-and-tear, distribution of
need, cost efficiencies, renewal cycle, and safety hierarchy in order to proactively
address damaged road paint surfacing and improve safety for all road users;
FURTHER THAT Council request staff include a line item for consideration in the 2024
Budget and ongoing, dedicated to regular road marking paint maintenance.

5. Road marking paints are critical for defining and delineating:
a. Hazards, stop lines, yields, medians, slow streets, sped limits, and
wayfinding,
b. Traffic lines, turning lanes, direction of flow, merging, and lane changing,
c. Pedestrian walkways, crossings, elephant’s feet, and zebra crosswalks,
d. Bike routes, unprotected bike lanes and boxes,
e. Bus zones and HOV lanes, and
f. Parking zones and restrictions;
6. Road marking paints are susceptible to more rapid wear due to high traffic
volumes, heavier vehicles, and increasing impacts of climate change including
damage caused variously by extreme heats, heavier rainfalls, and snow/ice
removal that require abrasive and corrosive application of ploughs, sand and salt.
Once the surface is damaged, water egress can further damage the substrate,
especially during freezing and thawing;
7. Damaged paint resulting in incomplete or degraded road markings can create
compromised visibility for all road users, especially in rainy or dark conditions,
and for active transportation users can further result in uneven surfaces that
create potential surface hazards in particular for cyclists and micromobility road
users;

8. Various reports, social media posts and anecdotes suggest road and crosswalk
visibility remain a hazard11 that is top of mind for many Vancouverites;
9. Many Canadian cities and provinces have regular scheduled full or (more
typically) partial rotating road marking re-painting programs to proactively
address wear and tear on surfacing, prevent substrate damage, and promote
greater visibility and safety; and
10. The City of Vancouver does not have a dedicated regularized program for road
marking paint maintenance and instead resurfaces road markings on an as need
ad hoc basis.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
THAT Council direct staff to report back with a regularized road marking
maintenance plan, considering wear-and-tear, distribution of need, cost
efficiencies, renewal cycle, and safety hierarchy in order to proactively address
damaged road paint surfacing and improve safety for all road users;
FURTHER THAT Council request staff provide additional information to inform a
potential amendment for consideration in the 2024 Budget and ongoing,
dedicated to regular road marking paint maintenance.

The Committee heard from three speakers in support, one speaker in opposition, and seven

THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. The Housing Vancouver Strategy was adopted by Council in 2017 to address the
city’s housing crisis by targeting 72,000 new homes over 10 years (2018-2027),
including policies to enable a shift to a greater supply of social, supportive, and
rental housing;
2. Despite many efforts to date, we continue to have people living on the margins of
life and death in our city – people who are in desperate need of better support,
those who are homeless or precariously housed, some struggling with personal
trauma, untreated mental illness, addiction, and chronic health issues. Health
experts and police alike continue to advocate that addiction issues are best
handled through the healthcare system, not the criminal justice system;

Minutes, Wednesday, November 29, 2023 17
3. Many observers have cited the need for governments at all levels to rethink how
we deliver social services across the spectrum. Many see the current
approaches as fragmentary and incomplete and are calling for significant
change, particularly with respect to our city’s – and our country’s – persistent and
increasingly complex struggle with mental health and addiction issues, including
the related struggle to provide affordable, safe housing across the housing
spectrum in our city;
4. Supportive housing – particularly in the context of complex care and for those
struggling with mental health, addictions, and homelessness – is commonly
differentiated from social housing. In addition to providing shelter, supportive
housing provides a range of on-site supports to residents, such as life-skills
training and connections to off-site services such as primary health care, mental
health, or substance use services that help individuals maintain housing stability.
These supports help tenants stabilize their lives, enhance their independent living
skills, and reconnect with their communities;
5. Vancouver has over 75 per cent of the Metro Vancouver region’s operating
shelter spaces, over 77 per cent of the region’s supportive housing units, and 50
per cent of the region’s social housing, while making up 25 per cent of the
region’s overall population;
6. Connecting people to the care they need is often the crucial first step on the long
road to greater mental and physical health and well-being, and housing is at the
core of any successful social and supportive housing plan. Vancouver’s Healthy
City Strategy promotes an integrated approach to human services to ensure that
all Vancouverites can have access to the services they need to thrive;
7. The Vancouver Plan is the City’s long-range land use plan. It builds on the
Housing Vancouver Strategy and is intended to guide growth and change in the
city over the next 30 years. Its purpose is to establish a unified vision for future
land use, with policies to help Vancouver become a more liveable, affordable,
sustainable city with a strong economy – “A city that is inclusive, diverse, and
works for everyone.”;
8. As the Vancouver Plan states:
“Adequate housing is a fundamental human right. Everyone from low-
income residents and newcomers, to seniors, young people, and growing
families, should have access to housing that is adequate, secure, and
affordable. The existing housing system is not meeting the needs of
Vancouver’s current or growing population.… To address this disparity,
new rental and social housing will be enabled in all neighbourhoods.
Policies contained in the section also address preserving affordability in
areas with existing rental and social housing… Collectively these policies
will result in more inclusive and affordable neighbourhoods across the
city.”;
9. Direction 1.4 of the Vancouver Plan (i.e., Community Housing – Part 5 section 1)
speaks directly to the question of social and supportive housing and seeks to

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, November 29, 2023 18
“Significantly increase the supply of social and supportive housing” and support
the growth of the community housing sector through land use policy and zoning
approaches (including pre-zoning), financial incentives, streamlined approval
processes, and by creating stronger partnerships between the City and the
community housing sector to support the sector in capacity building;
10. The community housing sector is made up of non-profit housing providers that
own, develop, or manage social, co-op, or supportive housing. Many community
housing non-profits provide affordable, stable homes for households earning low
to moderate-incomes, and are able to serve specific, and oftentimes highly
specific, needs;
11. Social housing has become increasingly important in the city due to rising rental
prices, yet it makes up less than 10 per cent of Vancouver’s overall housing
stock. As noted in the Vancouver Plan, “The existing housing system is not
meeting the needs of Vancouver’s current or growing population,” and “housing
opportunities are not evenly distributed across the city.”;
12. As of January 2023, there are 146 open Single Room Occupancy (SRO)
buildings in the City of Vancouver containing 6,500 units. Assuming that a
conservative target is to see the replacement of one SRO building per year, it will
take almost 150 years to transition the City’s SRO stock to a renewed supply of
self-contained, dignified units that achieve the minimum standards of liveability;
13. Only two projects, 288 East Hastings Street and Olivia Skye at 41 E Hastings,
have been built in the Downtown Eastside Oppenheimer District (DEOD) since
the Downtown Eastside Plan was approved by Council in 2014, which requires a
60/40 housing mix;
14. Homelessness is a regional issue, as are the issues of mental health and
addiction and the need for supportive housing. In order to successfully address
homelessness and precarious housing, these issues must be addressed more
broadly across the region and the province and with more partners at the table;
15. Championing the role of non-profits in the delivery of housing and strengthening
protections and supports for existing market and non-market housing rental stock
are essential policy levers and tools available to the City and the region. This will
require the protection and renewal of existing affordable housing stock in some
neighbourhoods of the City while providing new rental options, social housing
opportunities, and Missing Middle housing in others;
16. A healthy city and region require diverse social infrastructure and spaces that
work together to create a social infrastructure ecosystem that meets diverse
community needs. It requires a range of publicly and privately owned and
operated spaces, programs, and services that (directly or indirectly) support
relationships and interactions between community members and community
connectedness and belonging (Spaces to Thrive: Vancouver Social Infrastructure
Strategy – RTS 14727);

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, November 29, 2023 19
17. A world class city begins with its neighbourhoods, which must be designed with
intention in order to be inclusive, diverse places where all people can live, shop,
and work, for a city that thrives and serves as a beacon to others;
18. Social procurement is a tool that leverages purchasing power. It creates and
supports a range of positive social, economic, cultural, and environmental
impacts, including low-barrier economic opportunities that directly and/or
indirectly contribute to a person’s material security, such as money for basic
needs, food, access to housing, and to pay bills;
19. Homes with supports help to create safe, inclusive communities for everyone.
Bringing people inside means there are fewer people outside struggling to
survive. Supportive housing that is comprehensive offers:
• a warm, safe place to call home
• access the necessities of life such as food, washrooms, and laundry
• begins the process to heal from the damage caused by living outside
• Strengthened community connections
• fundamental supports that are accessible and inclusive
• culturally appropriate services
• unique supports for seniors that cater to their needs
• Indigenous wellness and healing services
• health supports for those living with substance use disorder
• access to mental wellness
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council affirm its support for the City’s
social and supportive housing strategies, which aim to deliver an increased supply
of affordable social housing units, as well as a greater supply of quality, liveable
supportive housing units with a robust continuum of care resources; and
FURTHER THAT Council direct staff to report back on opportunities and
recommendations to enact the following policy directions, in pursuit of a greater supply
of high quality social and supportive housing across the City of Vancouver:
A. Explore mechanisms and strategies to accelerate the full replacement of
existing SROs in the City of Vancouver, including exploration of a pilot funding
program to support the interim repair and renovation of the existing publicly and
privately owned SROs on an urgent basis, in partnership with BC Housing and
CMHC;
FURTHER THAT Council request that the Mayor write a letter to BC Housing
and CMHC and the Provincial and Federal Ministers responsible for Housing
requesting a partnership to enact this pilot program; and
FURTHER THAT Council request that the Mayor write a letter to FCM asking
for their assistance in advocating to the federal government to reinstate an SRO
specific funding stream as a part of the Residential Rehabilitation Assistance
Program (RRAP).

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, November 29, 2023 20
B. Review the City’s and Province’s SRO strategies to determine whether
culturally appropriate health services provided via pop-up on-site clinics, such
as the Vancouver Urban Health Centre model, enhances housing outcomes,
with consideration to endorse, advocate for, and/or pilot such health services.
C. Report back on the impacts of aligning the City’s definition of social housing
and supportive housing with Provincial definitions and funding program
requirements to establish clear definitions for all housing providers and
operators to utilize.
D. Explore opportunities for an improved regional approach to address the Metro
Vancouver region’s homelessness and housing issues.
E. Explore options to update the DTES Area Plan, with the goal to deliver a
greater number of social and supportive housing units in the DEOD to meet
the needs of residents, including updated economic testing in consultation
with a range of non-profit organizations, including the Province, area
residents, and community-led and Indigenous-led stakeholder groups.
F. Accelerate Council’s previous direction to explore a Pre-emptive Right by-law
(aka Right of First Refusal By-law), which would give the City the priority to
purchase buildings or lands for sale to provide housing choices that are
equitably distributed throughout the city, and report back to Council with
recommendations by Q2 2024;
FURTHER THAT this shall also include recommendations on how the City
can leverage a Pre-emptive Right by-law to the benefit of the VAHEF and
PEF in accordance with the mandate of the City’s new Housing Development
Office.
G. Explore opportunities for the City of Vancouver to partner with non-profit
organizations to support low-income economic development within
jurisdictional powers, such as jobs, employment, and life skills development
as an intersectional approach to social policy, including advocating for a
review of the “income continuum” to better stabilize people’s lives and enable
employment while embedding social procurement as a core consideration to
enabling low-threshold economic engagement opportunities, job training, and
skills development into the design of local initiatives that include, but are not
limited to, renovations of SRO stock, affordable housing stock, and the like;
FURTHER THAT Council recognize and acknowledge the important role
senior government plays in the wider social infrastructure ecosystem, while
also recognizing the specific and unique roles the City can play on the local
level where the City is best positioned to provide those initiatives.
H. Direct staff to work with non-profit organizations to explore potential policy
options and social benefit strategies that enable below-market commercial
spaces (in the DTES and elsewhere in the city) to help create a diversity of
spaces, programs, and services that meet community needs and enable a
thriving social infrastructure ecosystem and a healthy city.

12 Within the Vancouver Plan, social housing is used as a general term that also includes supportive housing and non-profit co-op

housing income limits, as set out in the “Housing Income Limits” table published by BC Housing, is owned by a non-profit
corporation, a non-profit co-operative association, or by or on behalf of the City, the Province of British Columbia, or Canada, and
secured by a housing agreement or other legal commitment (as defined in City of Vancouver Zoning & Development Bylaw). These
types of housing also meet the definition of social housing within the City’s Zoning & Development Bylaw.

information, Section 7.7(a) allowed Council to ask clarifying questions of
speakers. In the May 2023 report, “Amendments to the Procedure By-law No.
12577”, staff recommended reducing the time for questions from three minutes to
one minute. The report was subsequently amended to eliminate questions
altogether. Without the option to ask clarifying questions, it is difficult for
Councillors to demonstrate accountability to the community;
6. Meeting sessions held in camera are the portions of meetings that are not open
to the public due to the sensitive nature of the information shared. The Procedure
By-law does not explicitly provide guidance on in camera meetings;

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, November 29, 2023 28
7. In Vancouver, the criteria for holding meetings in camera are set out in section
165.2 of the Vancouver Charter iii and broadly includes HR and personal issues,
labour relations, land deals, litigation, and information (often timely) that may
harm the interests of the City. The Vancouver Charter does not expressly provide
that the subject matter, disclosure, discussion, decision, or votes cast must be
treated as confidential;
8. While the Vancouver Charter is not explicit on the extent of confidentiality, the
analogous Community Charter iv does identify that under section 117(1): “A
council member or former council member must… keep in confidence
information considered in any part of a council meeting or council committee
meeting that was lawfully closed to the public, until the council or committee
discusses the information at a meeting that is open to the public or releases the
information to the public”;
9. While the rules around in camera differ between local governments, in many
provinces, best practices suggest that although in camera discussions are held in
private, as much as possible:
a. decisions or motions should be made publicly in open meeting,
b. justifications for going in-camera should be as explicit as possible, and
c. there should be options to release or withhold in-camera material
following the closed meeting at a subsequent open meeting;
For example, the Province of Alberta advises “[participants] included in the
closed session are required to keep in confidence what was discussed until the
item is discussed at a meeting held in public”;
In its 2012 report, the BC Ombudsperson suggests a determination of how much
to disclose should be made on a case-by-case basis keeping in mind the
importance of transparency;
“Sometimes the level of confidentiality afforded by closed meetings is
necessary to pass resolutions that ensure the orderly functioning of the
local government. Some matters must be discussed entirely in
confidence. Passing resolutions in closed meetings however, can never
be used to conceal the decision-making process from the legitimate gaze
of the public. Indeed, local governments should always try to provide as
much information as possible about any resolutions passed during closed
meetings, including when possible, the considerations on which they were
based.” ;
10. Meetings held in camera can and should be a “safe space” for discussion. To
facilitate that, best practices suggest discussions should not be captured in notes
or minutes. The Province of Alberta strongly recommends that, “a closed session
discussion not be recorded as any notes or minutes taken during the discussion
may become part of a FOIP request.” However, while respecting safe space for

Minutes, Wednesday, November 29, 2023 29
discussion, accountability for the outcomes of those discussions should provide a
counter balance;
11. As a matter of practice, the City of Vancouver releases in camera decisions and
reports specifically and only “because they are no longer considered sensitive”.
These releases do not include the voting records of decisions made or minutes of
discussion;
12. Following the release of an in camera decision on the Living Wage Program by
the City of Vancouver in March 2023, one Councillor indicated how they voted
while two Councillors indicated their position on the issue but not explicit vote.
The former Councillor was subsequently subject of a code of conduct complaint
for disclosing their vote, costing good will and taxpayer funds to resolve, and
illustrating the lack of clarity around in camera procedure. A subsequent
investigation by the Integrity Commissioner for the City of Vancouver showed
that the City has been unclear and inconsistent with regard to disclosure of in
camera votes and recommended the City adopt a clear policy that clarifies
expectations for Council about how, if ever, a Councillor can say how they voted
in an in camera meeting; and
13. A further bulletin by the Integrity Commissioner for the City of Vancouver
highlighted the Open Meeting Principle, and its importance to municipal
democratic process; specifically highlighting the requirement to allow for public
discussion and consideration of the matter before any vote is made by
Councillors. With affirmation that if a majority or caucus of Councillors are
informally gathering to discuss a matter it must be transparent and accessible to
the public.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council affirms the principles of accountability for decisions and actions
taken during the course of their duties should apply as rigorously as possible.
B. THAT Council request staff to report back with a proposed amendment to Part 7
of the Procedure By-law that includes a provision for a member of Council to
request, at the discretion of the chair, to ask clarifying questions of speakers for 1
minute.
C. THAT Council request staff to report back with proposed amendments to the
Procedure By-law to regulate the procedures of Council within and with regard to
closed in camera meetings, which require:
i. Open meeting justifications for going in camera that are as explicit as
possible;
ii. Wherever advisable, decisions to take place in open meetings; and
iii. Where decisions take place in a closed session, provision for a specific
decision to withhold voting results if necessary, and rationale for why.

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, November 29, 2023 30
D. THAT pending amendments to the Procedure By-law with regard to in camera
meetings, staff are directed to include votes or rationale for withholding votes
when future in camera decisions and reports are deemed no longer sensitive and
published on the City website.
E. THAT Staff are directed to summarize as explicitly as possible what in camera
meetings were held at the next available open meeting, and to advise Council of
the publication of any in camera items deemed no longer sensitive as part of
regular Council reporting agenda.

meetings that contain recommendations as provided in Part 7 of the Procedure
