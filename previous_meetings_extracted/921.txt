UNFINISHED BUSINESS
1. Exploring New Forms of Hospitality and Housing Tenure to Support Purpose Built
Rental
At the reconvened Standing Committee on Policy and Strategic Priorities meeting on
June 19, 2019, Council heard from speakers and referred discussion and decision to the
Regular Council meeting on June 25, 2019, as Unfinished Business.
MOVED by Councillor Fry
SECONDED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
WHEREAS
1. More than half of the population of the City of Vancouver rent their home;
2. Rents are high and vacancy rates are low, which has been characterized as a
crisis;
3. The City of Vancouver has committed to a target of 20,000 new purpose-built
rental units to be approved by 2027;
4. Developer Cost Levies (DCLs) are an important source of revenue for City
facilities like Parks, Childcare facilities, Social and non-profit housing, and
Engineering infrastructure;

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, June 25, 2019 4
5. The City of Vancouver waives Developer Cost Levies (DCLs) to encourage the
construction of purpose-built rental through the Moderate Income Rental Housing
Pilot Program, and for “For Profit Affordable Housing” through the Rental 100
program;
6. Rents under Rental 100 typically exceed the measure of affordability for the
median Vancouver household income (less than $80,000);
7. Hotel and traveler accommodations support one of Vancouver and the region’s
primary industries. In 2017, tourism contributed approximately $4.8 billion to the
Metro Vancouver economy and supported over 70,000 full time jobs;
8. For the last 15 years, the number of Vancouver hotel rooms have been in
decline. The loss of hotel supply has put upward pressure on the market and the
average costs of the remaining hotel stock are consistently among the highest in
Canada;
9. Tourism Vancouver warned the City risks losing its competitive edge as a tourism
destination over hotel room shortages; potentially over $2 billion in visitor
spending over 12 years (Tourism in Vancouver: Hotel Demand, Supply and
Impact - 12 April, 2019);
10. Tourism Vancouver have undergone 2030 planning, and have recommended
that between 3,000 - 4,000 hotel rooms are required to meet visitor demand;
11. Modern traveler preferences for Do-it-yourself (DIY) apartment-style
accommodations have led to growth in individually-owned peer-to-peer (P2P)
“short term rentals” (STRs) like Airbnb and VRBO; variously marketed under the
slogan “live like a local.”;
12. P2P STRs like Airbnb and VRBO can replace long-term local (resident) rental
housing supply with short-term visitor accommodations. Despite regulations,
anecdotal reports and self-appointed watchdogs suggest P2P STRs are a threat
to long-term rental stock;
13. Modern traveler preferences for Do-it-yourself (DIY) apartment-style
accommodations are also inspiring the growth of “tech-enabled hospitality”
options in the new form of corporate-run apartment-hotel hybrids like Stay Alfred,
Lyric, and Sonder;
14. The tech-enabled hospitality model avails:
a. Locations in purpose-built rental, strata, or commercial buildings;
b. Forgoing lobby, concierge, and otherwise traditional hotel amenities;
c. Opportunities to “live like a local,” with locations potentially inside or
outside of traditional hotel districts;
d. An alternative to P2P STRs for the DIY traveler;
e. A discrete experience that is minimally impactful on long term local
residents and neighbourhoods: Suites and floors are accessed by coded
key fob, apps link guests to services operated out of remote locations,

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, June 25, 2019 5
and sound monitors support good neighbour agreements;
15. The tech-enabled hospitality model can also avail:
a. A financial incentive for developers to build new Purpose-Built Rental
leveraging a time-limited master lease for a portion of hospitality use in
the building.
b. The increased supply of new market rental, supported by tech enabled
hospitality units in new Purpose-Built Rental (PBR) buildings;
c. The increased supply of new market rental, once the tech-enabled
hospitality units themselves are released from their lease;
16. The Canadian company Sonder (named in Forbes as one of 2018’s Next Billion
Dollar Startups) have undertaken master leases for entire floors of units in new
purpose-built apartment buildings, and helping to build new PBR buildings. For
example, in Central Philadelphia, Sonder have committed to master leases on
hundreds of units in planned buildings which in turn has provided developers with
financial security to build;
17. Members of the development community have expressed interest in this model
and tech-enabled hospitality providers have expressed interest in the Vancouver
market, but the city lacks a comprehensive policy, so the barrier to entry is too
high.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to explore new forms of hospitality and housing tenure
with development and construction industry, tech-enabled hospitality operators,
and lenders including CMHC.
B. THAT Council direct staff to consider how limited term master leases for tech-
enabled hospitality might function with regard to covenants, change of use, split
classification tax, licensing, legal, zoning, and city-wide planning.
C. THAT Council direct staff to consider in their July 2019 report on Rental Incentive
Program Review if tech-enabled hospitality models in lieu of DCL waivers might
improve the financial performance and delivery of for-profit purpose built rentals.
D. THAT Council direct staff to include in their July 2019 report on Rental Incentive
Program Review any budget and resource considerations.
E. THAT Council direct staff to include in their Winter 2019 report back on Rental
100, how incentive (specifically tech-enabled hospitality models) options other
than DCL waivers that might improve financial performance and delivery of for-
profit purpose built rentals.

2. Restoring Provincial Library Funding
MOVED by Councillor Boyle
SECONDED by Councillor De Genova
WHEREAS
1. Public libraries require continuous and increasing investment to provide
opportunities for life-long learning, increase equity and social inclusion, and
create cities that are healthier and more affordable;
2. Provincial funding for public libraries has declined in the past decade as a portion
of total revenue allocated to individual BC library systems, from 7% to 4.6%,
while the municipal portion has risen from 72% to 80%;
3. This decline in provincial funding reflects a regressive approach of shifting cost to
municipal property tax payers.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT the Mayor, on behalf of Vancouver City Council, write a letter to Minister

3. Transparent Process and Taxation for Land Banks Repurposed as Temporary
Recreational Properties
MOVED by Councillor Fry
SECONDED by Councillor Hardwick
WHEREAS
1. Over the past decade, vacant land development holdings throughout the City of
Vancouver have been converted to use as public recreation space, variously as
temporary parks and gardens;
2. As a result of installing temporary public parks or gardens, the respective lots are
reclassified by the BC Assessment Authority from Class 6 (Business, other) to
Class 8 (Recreation);
3. The City of Vancouver has the authority to determine land use, but has no
authority under the BC Assessment Act to determine property classification.
Property classification is done by BC Assessment in accordance with the BC
Assessment Act;
4. Property classifications by BC Assessment do not necessarily align with the
City’s land use policies. Unless the Assessment Act is amended, class
conversions are really a land use enforcement issue;
5. Reclassification from Class 6 to 8 nets significant property tax savings of nearly
two-thirds. In 2019 for example, the mill rate on Class 6 is $9.32931 per $1,000
assessed value; for Class 8, the mill rate is $3.86290 per $1,000 assessed value;
6. While these new temporary recreation spaces might impart some public
community benefit, they also impart significant financial benefit to the owners of
development holdings and may unfairly shift the tax burden to other property
owners;
7. In a February 17, 2009, motion Council directed staff to report back on context
and number of temporary recreation spaces on the whole, as well as options for
Council to consider in order to ensure a fair taxation model;
8. Typically the physical conversion of a property from Class 6 to Class 8 would
require property owners to apply for a development permit and a change of use
however this has not necessarily been the practice with land bank to public
recreation space conversions as described;
9. In a May 25, 2009, memo replying to Council direction, City staff presented
options that considered maintaining the status quo; appealing BC Assessments
classifications; or requiring either strict or conditional approvals on development
applications to convert land from a business (Class 6) to recreational (Class 8)
property use;

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, June 25, 2019 19
10. The de facto decision at the time of that memo and since then has been to
maintain the status quo.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to review analysis in the memo from May 25, 2009, and
report back to Council on the feasibility of a hybrid system of strict enforcement
and conditional conversions of the use from business (Class 6) to recreational
(Class 8) uses that considers highest and best use of land, public benefits, and
potential tax revenue.
B. THAT Council direct staff in its report back to present criteria to define basic
standards of conditional conversion including but not limited to
commercialization, advertising, public access, and community benefits.
C. THAT Council direct staff to engage the Province and BC Assessment through
the inter-governmental working group to clarify and, where necessary, amend the
criteria for conversion with the goal of reducing/eliminating potential abuse of the
system.
D. THAT Council direct staff to report back on the above recommendations and any
necessary by-law amendments and considerations before end of Q4 2019.

WHEREAS
1. Through their own emissions and emissions from their products, 90 entities
(primarily fossil fuel companies) are collectively responsible for almost two thirds
of human-caused greenhouse gases
(https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-013-0986-y);
2. To deal with sea-level rise alone, the City of Vancouver expects to pay $1 billion,
and Metro Vancouver municipalities as a whole $9.5 billion, between now and
2100 (Vancouver Courier, Vancouver Sun);
3. To mitigate the effects of climate change and to help limit global warming to
1.5°C, Vancouver has adopted a Climate Emergency Response, which includes
funding its own target of being carbon neutral before 2050 as well as “helping

developing jurisdictions transition to renewable energy” (Climate Emergency
Response, p. 8);
4. Fossil fuel companies have not had to pay or be accountable for their share of
the damage that communities and municipalities, including Vancouver, must now
pay to prepare for and recover from;
5. BC has enacted legislation that holds opioid and tobacco producers liable for
health care costs and could do the same for fossil fuel producers (Tobacco
Damages and Health Care Costs Recovery Act and Opioid Damages and Health
Care Costs Recovery Act);
6. Over 20 municipalities and regional districts in BC have sent letters :
a. to Provincial and Federal governments to push for legislation to hold fossil
fuel producers strictly liable for climate-related harms if the producer is
responsible for greenhouse gas emissions at a globally detectable level;
and/or
b. to 20 of the world’s largest fossil fuel companies asking that these
companies pay a fair share of local costs, referencing climate impacts
including, but not limited to, sea level rise, infrastructure changes, and
increased wildfire, and the percent responsible according to their percent
of emissions calculated in the 2013 paper “Tracing Anthropogenic Carbon
Dioxide and Methane Emissions to Fossil Fuel and Cement Producers,
1854-2010” (updated by the author to 2013).
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT the Mayor, on behalf of Council, write to Canada’s Minister of Environment
and Climate Change and BC’s Minister of Environment and Climate Change
Strategy to request that they enact legislation holding fossil fuel companies liable
for climate-related harms caused by their contributions to climate change,
providing Ontario’s “Liability for Climate Related Harms” Bill as sample
framework.
B. THAT the Mayor, on behalf of Council, write to the 20 fossil fuel companies with
the highest percentage of greenhouse gas emissions to ask that they be
accountable for their share of climate emergency costs-templates and letters
sent by other municipalities are available online.
C. THAT the Mayor, on behalf of Council, reach out to local governments in BC and
across Canada (including Victoria and Toronto) to investigate cooperation and
