B. Council Members’ Motions
1. Targeted COVID Funding Program for Vancouver’s Chinatown
On November 17, 2020, it was
MOVED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
SECONDED by Councillor Fry
WHEREAS
1. COVID-19 has had significant negative economic impact including on small
businesses and neighbourhoods across Vancouver (due to closure periods,
physical distancing requirements and costs of additional cleaning and safety
protocols). A full economic recovery from COVID-19 is expected to take some
time, likely years;
2. Due to the coronavirus pandemic Vancouver’s Chinatown, a community we all
know and love and a federally designated National Historic Site, has been
devastated economically;
3. Even as some areas of the economy contemplate and progress through safe re-
opening and operations, Chinatown’s legacy small businesses and arts
organizations continue to face significant hardship as a result of the pandemic
and remain closed, due in part to the drastic decrease in tourism traffic, both from
international and local visitors. This has led to many of tourism-driven businesses
closing, which in turn has lead businesses catering to local clientele to also
shutter;

Council Meeting
Minutes, November 3, 5 and 17, 2020 34
4. If a lifeline is not forthcoming to support the historical area’s culturally relevant,
legacy small businesses and arts and culture organizations, many of these
organizations will not survive the pandemic and will be lost forever, depriving the
area of its living culture and eliminating the essence that is Chinatown—the very
thing that draws visitors annually to this renowned cultural tourism destination;
5. The federal government has begun to roll out targeted support programs to
specifically address similar situations for some of Vancouver’s other tourism-
based districts where current federal programs are insufficient or inapplicable.
Recent announcements include $2 million in funding for the Vancouver Aquarium
and $17 million for Granville Island. The Granville Island funding announcement
equates the $17 million to a year’s worth of revenue from rent and parking and
would allow all tenants at Granville Island to put off rent and operating expenses
for a year, thus relieving financial pressure while businesses figure out how to re-
open safely amidst a stark downturn in customer traffic. Like Granville Island,
Chinatown is a tourist destination whose legacy small businesses rely heavily on
tourism traffic;
6. Although federal programs such as CEWS, CECRA, and CEBA are available and
have been designed with the best intentions to provide some relief for most
communities, in Chinatown, these programs are either ineffective, inapplicable,
or inaccessible. In the case of the wage subsidy, due to insufficient customer
traffic to Chinatown, many businesses cannot justify the retention of staff.
Regarding the rental subsidy, private landlords have the unilateral authority to
apply for the program, leaving tenants without recourse should the landlord
decline to apply. At the same time, many non-private landlords such as is the
case for government-owned property, do not qualify. Factor in language
inaccessibility, and this creates a fundamentally untenable state for our
community. Many legacy businesses in Chinatown are running towards the end
of their rope as they struggle to pay rent. Many of these legacy family businesses
are reaching the point of desperation as cash flow continues to be a major
challenge despite the availability of these programs;
7. Vancouver’s Chinatown, a National Historic site, is home to many unique cultural
heritage assets and is working towards a potential application for a UNESCO
World Heritage Site designation. The basis of any application for a World
Heritage Site designation hinges on the living cultural heritage that exists in
Chinatown through its residents and its culturally relevant legacy business and
arts organizations. It is the notes from a Cantonese opera, the delicacies of the
herbal shops, the drumming of a lion dance ceremony, the varied dialects of the
greengrocer hawkers, and the echoing of mahjong tiles. Without federal
assistance, many of the organizations where this living cultural heritage exists
are at extreme risk of not surviving the pandemic and being lost forever;
8. A broad number of groups have come together to advocate for a Federal
targeted support program for Vancouver’s Chinatown including the Vancouver
Chinatown Legacy Stewardship Group, Vancouver Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Classical
Chinese Garden, Chinese Cultural Centre of Vancouver, Chinatown Plaza
Tenants Association, Vancouver Chinatown Merchants Association and
Vancouver Chinatown Merchants Association;

Council Meeting
Minutes, November 3, 5 and 17, 2020 35
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council ask the Mayor to write to the Prime
Minister, the Honourable Mélanie Joly, M.P., Minister of Economic Development and
Official Languages and the Honourable Mary Ng, M.P. Minister of Small Business,
Export Promotion and International Trade, to call for a Targeted COVID Funding
Program for Vancouver’s Chinatown to provide financial support for local, small
businesses, and cultural and arts organizations (including legacy businesses that are an
integral part of Chinatown’s cultural heritage and those that are the key attractions for
tourism and visitors) to assist in preserving this National Historic Site for generations to
come, by providing funding similar to that given to the Granville Island district.
