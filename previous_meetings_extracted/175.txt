Registry

MOVED by Councillor Zhou
SECONDED by Councillor Fry
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. Transparency and accountability are fundamental principles of good governance
and help to build public trust in government institutions;

Standing Committee on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, October 23, 2024 10
2. The Office of the Registrar of Lobbyists is an independent office of the B.C.
legislature. It has a mandate to oversee, monitor, and enforce the Lobbyists
Transparency Act (LTA);
3. The LTA requires individuals and organizations who lobby public office holders
provincially, and meet specific criteria, to register their lobbying activities in an
online public registry;
4. Lobbying activities are a legitimate part of the democratic process and can
provide valuable input into government decision-making. Individuals and
organizations employ lobbyists to ensure that their concerns and/or positions are
heard by governments and to have those concerns addressed;
5. There is currently no provincial legislation in B.C. that specifically regulates the
lobbying of local governments, nor is there any specific legislation that authorizes
municipal councils to establish and enforce lobbyist registries. This has led to a
small number of communities to consider establishing a registry of their own in
patchwork fashion;
6. Provincial and local governments across the country have approached the
creation of municipal lobbyist registries in a variety of ways, including: voluntary
registries, registries administered at the local level and those administered at the
provincial level;
7. Several municipalities and provinces across Canada, including Toronto, Ontario,
and British Columbia, have implemented lobbyist registries to increase
transparency around lobbying activities and ensure the public has access to
information regarding who is attempting to influence public officials;
8. To date, Surrey and Kelowna are the only local governments in B.C. to have
established municipal lobbyist registries on their own. Surrey set up their registry
in 2008 and Kelowna's registry was established in September 2023. More
recently, in May 2024, Port Moody City Council considered a motion to establish
a lobbyist registry but ultimately rejected the idea based on a majority vote at
Council;
9. Delegates to the Union of BC Municipalities (UBCM) have twice considered --
and subsequently endorsed -- resolutions calling on the Province to establish
some form of Municipal Lobbyist Registry (2017 and 2019);
10. In response to the UBCM resolutions in 2017 and 2019, the Provincial
government has expressed a willingness to discuss initiatives like a municipal
lobbyist registry to increase local government accountability and promote
openness and transparency in interactions between public servants, elected
officials, and lobbyists;
11. The Province has specifically stated to the UBCM that it will need "a clearer
understanding of what local governments hope to achieve through a municipal
lobbyist registry to ensure that an approach is taken that meets those intended
outcomes and meets the needs of any local government interested in having a

Standing Committee on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, October 23, 2024 11
lobbyist registry." Likewise, if local governments, through the Union of BC
Municipalities, express an interest in establishing mandatory lobbyist registries,
the Province has stated that it is willing to discuss the matter further;
12. A municipal lobbyist registry overseen by the Provincial Government, with
uniform application across the Province rather than a patchwork of locally-
created registries, would provide the residents of Vancouver, as well as those of
other B.C. communities, with a much clearer understanding of who is lobbying
their locally elected officials, senior staff, and other decision-makers;
13. The absence of a formal lobbyist registry in the City of Vancouver and across the
province is a clear gap in transparency and accountability which could be filled by
the creation of a publicly accessible database of lobbyist activities overseen by
the Province's Office of the Registrar of Lobbyists under an amended LTA;
14. A municipal lobbyist registry overseen by the Province would help prevent actual
or perceived conflicts of interest and ensure that decisions made by the City are
in the best interests of the public, rather than the result of undue influence by
private interests; and
15. As the Province's Office of the Registrar of Lobbyists aptly notes on its website:
"A strong democracy is built on access to a government that conducts its
business transparently and is willing to listen to its constituents."
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council request the Mayor write to the Provincial government expressing
the City’s interest in the establishment of a Municipal Lobbyist Registry overseen
by the Province for the purpose of tracking, and making publicly available,
information on individuals or organizations that engage in lobbying activities of
local governments, senior staff and other key decision-makers.
B. THAT Council endorse the following resolution for submission to the 2025 UBCM
convention for the consideration of the membership:
RESOLUTION
MOTION: Requesting the Provincial Government Oversee a City of
Vancouver Lobbyist Registry
WHEREAS the Union of BC Municipalities (UBCM) has twice considered -- and
subsequently endorsed -- resolutions calling on the Province to establish a
Municipal Lobbyist Registry (2017 and 2019), there is currently no provincial
legislation in BC that specifically regulates the lobbying of local governments, nor
is there any specific legislation that authorizes municipal councils to establish
and enforce lobbyist registries. The Province has previously indicated a
willingness to explore the matter pending a clearer understanding of what local
governments hope to achieve to ensure that any approach taken meets the
intended outcomes and needs of local governments;

Standing Committee on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, October 23, 2024 12
AND WHEREAS the absence of a formal Municipal Lobbyist Registry represents
a clear gap in transparency and accountability which could be filled by the
creation of a publicly accessible database of lobbyist activities which would
provide residents with a much clearer understanding of who is lobbying their
locally elected officials, senior staff, and other decision-makers:
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT UBCM renew its call on the Provincial
government to establish a Municipal Lobbyist Registry and that UBCM explore
the creation of a working group to develop a clear set of goals for a Municipal
Lobbyist Registry.

MOVED by Councillor Montague
SECONDED by Councillor Meiszner
WHEREAS
1. The safety and security of Vancouver residents, visitors, and businesses is of
paramount importance to Council and to the City of Vancouver;
2. An effective and efficient response to crime, major events, emergencies, and
serious incidents is essential to maintaining public order and the safety and
security of everyone in our City;
3. The Vancouver Police Department (VPD) is committed to serving and protecting
the community with the utmost dedication and professionalism;
4. Utilization of modern technology is a critical component in fulfilling the VPD's
21st-century commitment to serving and protecting the community and
maintaining public order and the safety and security of everyone in our city;
5. The City of Vancouver has an extensive network of traffic cameras strategically
placed at intersections throughout the city to monitor traffic: Approximately 221
cameras across the city;
6. Canada-wide, police departments' access to municipal camera systems varies
widely by jurisdiction. Generally speaking, municipalities operate traffic cameras
for public safety, traffic management, and bylaw enforcement, with access to
these camera systems ranging from real-time monitoring of cameras to later
retrieval of recorded video footage upon request for investigative purposes;
7. Many large urban cities across Canada are already providing varying degrees of
access to City cameras to assist police agencies. For example, traffic camera
footage from Surrey – publicly released by IHIT and the RCMP – was
instrumental in the arrests of three individuals who are now charged with the first

Standing Committee on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, October 23, 2024 14
degree murder of Hardeep Singh Nijjar at the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in
June 2023;
8. At present, the City of Vancouver's traffic camera network is not accessible to the
Vancouver Police Department. Moreover, the live feed from traffic cameras is not
recorded and stored for after-the-fact investigative purposes;
9. The City's traffic camera network could be a valuable tool for the VPD in their
efforts to safeguard the community by enhancing situational awareness,
improving the speed and coordination of law enforcement responses, in crime
prevention and investigation, and protecting the rights and property of the city's
inhabitants;
10. Real-time integration and access to the City's traffic camera network by the
Vancouver Police Department could significantly enhance the VPD’s operational
capabilities by providing real-time visual information that allows for a more
effective and efficient deployment of police resources to incidents as they occur,
not only for quicker response times but also for more informed and effective
decision-making in critical situations; and
11. Without question, VPD access to the City’s traffic camera network must be
balanced with the right to privacy of the citizens, ensuring that any use of the
traffic camera network by the Vancouver Police Department is conducted with
the utmost respect for these rights with guidelines to prevent misuse and to
maintain public trust in law enforcement practices.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council confirm its interest in providing Vancouver Police Department with
real-time access to video captured by the City of Vancouver’s traffic camera
network, to aid police officers on a needs basis in responding to incidents such
as, but not limited to, in-progress crimes, missing persons cases, priority 9-1-1
calls, natural disasters, and other major events;
FURTHER THAT Council direct staff to analyze the technical, financial, and legal
implications of providing such access to the Vancouver Police Department and
report back to Council by Q1 2025.
B. THAT Council direct staff to report back regarding the operational, financial, and
legal implications of recording all video captured by the City of Vancouver’s traffic
camera network and maintaining the recorded data for a period of seven days to
allow time for the recordings to be made available to VPD upon request for
investigative purposes;
FURTHER THAT the report back consider the establishment of clear guidelines
through a formal agreement between the City of Vancouver and the VPD to
govern the use, storage, and dissemination of such video footage to ensure
public trust.

xwməθkwəy̓əm (Musqueam Indian Band), Sḵwx̱wú7mesh (Squamish Nation),
səlilwətaɬ (Tsleil-Waututh Nation), and urban Indigenous communities;
3. On Wednesday, November 15, 2023, at the Standing Committee of Council on
City Finance and Services, Council directed staff "to facilitate the creation of new
programs, policies, or mechanisms under the City’s Housing Development Office
that will unlock the delivery of new middle-income housing in the city on City-
owned land" including "exploring potential partnerships with First Nations, private
sector/industry partners, other government agencies, non-profits and faith-based
groups.";
4. Faith-based religious groups have long been an integral part of Vancouver's rich
community fabric, and the City recognizes the positive social impact
congregations have contributed to the city and its people, including providing
shelter, support, housing for vulnerable populations and other amenities;
5. Faith-based groups own substantial land assets in Vancouver. These lands have
enormous potential for community-oriented redevelopment in alignment with the
City’s goals of inclusivity, sustainability, and reconciliation;
6. Many properties owned by faith-based religious groups are rapidly aging and
face extensive deferred maintenance issues. These properties represent a
significant, yet untapped, potential for addressing Vancouver’s significant
housing needs and other challenges;
7. There is an increasing interest among faith-based communities to redevelop their
properties and to utilize their spaces and lands for broader social purposes
beyond traditional worship, reflecting a mission-based commitment to community
welfare, reconciliation, and achieving greater social impact;
8. Despite having significant land holdings, many faith-based groups lack the
specific knowledge required to initiate redevelopment projects and could benefit
from guidance and support from the City, such as advice on the various City
programs that could help to facilitate socially impactful redevelopment of
properties;

Standing Committee on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, October 23, 2024 19
9. There is a clear, mutually advantageous opportunity for the City to collaborate
more closely with faith-based groups, specifically to explore innovative solutions
for the redevelopment and optimal use of their land resources for greater social
impacts, such as enhanced community services, providing affordable housing,
and meeting other social impact objectives; and
10. The City of Vancouver has various existing policy pathways that could assist
faith-based groups in moving their redevelopment projects forward. For example,
(i) the Social Housing or Rental Tenure (SHORT) Program, which aims for faster
production of affordable housing by reducing development approval times for
high-impact multi-family housing projects, (ii) the Interim Rezoning Policy for
Social Housing, Seniors Housing, and Institutional, Cultural and Recreational
Uses, and (iii) additional height and density for mass timber construction in
rezoning applications. 1
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council recognizes the housing, social impact, and community benefits
potential of properties owned by faith-based religious groups by formally
inviting faith-based groups, BC Housing, the Provincial and Federal
governments, and other stakeholders to a City hosted dialogue to advance
and expedite the collaborative redevelopment of these unique properties.
B. THAT Council directs staff to report back regarding resources and staff support
available to faith-based groups and organizations considering redevelopment
projects in Vancouver, as well as potential policy and/or regulatory changes that
would support the deployment of these properties to deliver affordable housing.

4. A Lobbyist Registry for Vancouver
The Committee heard from one speaker who spoke in support of the report recommendations.
MOVED by Councillor Fry
SECONDED by Councillor Carr
WHEREAS
1. The public has an interest in greater transparency and accountability from our
municipal government;
1 SHORT seeks to complete rezoning approvals in 28 weeks and development permits in 12 weeks, cutting around 40 weeks out of
the current process. SHORT criteria to determine if a project qualifies for this special priority process include the level of affordability
for renters, locations on government or non-profit owned land with secured funding, and inclusion of an Indigenous partner or
residents.

Standing Committee on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, October 23, 2024 20
2. Lobbyists are people whose business is trying to influence legislation, regulation,
or other government decisions, actions, or policies on behalf of a group or
individual who hires them;
3. Lobbyist registries are intended to provide a public record that is accessible to
residents of interactions between public servants, elected officials, and lobbyists
in order to further transparency and accountability;
4. Provincial and local governments across the country have approached the
creation of municipal lobbyist registries in a variety of ways, including voluntary
registries, registries administered at the local level, and those administered at the
provincial level;
5. In BC, the provincial lobbyist registry (the Office of the Registrar of Lobbyists) is
empowered under the Lobbyist Registration Act to enforce compliance, conduct
investigations and levy administrative penalties. The Office of the Registrar of
Lobbyists together with the office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner
have a combined budget of about $8m per annum;
6. The BC Office of the Registrar of Lobbyists has not and does not currently apply
to local governments;
7. Since 2008, Vancouver City Council have considered the creation of a lobbyist
registry. A lobbyist registry was rejected by the NPA council majority in 2008. In
2017 and 2018, one UBCM2 and two consecutive Council 3,4 resolutions were
approved with multi-partisan support asking the province to amend legislation to
fund and administer the regulation of lobbying at the city, with support from the
provincial lobbyist registry.
Vancouver Council also asked staff to investigate the City of Surrey's voluntary
lobbyist registry including costs, impacts and any information on what informed
their decision to have a municipal lobbyist registry;
8. Since 2008 the City of Surrey has had a voluntary registry for a limited set of
lobbying activities.5 The Surrey lobbyist registry is updated around the first of
each month and published online;
9. The April 2017 council-directed report back memorandum from Vancouver’s
Deputy City Manager 6 summarized some key distinctions of the Surrey lobbyist
registry, notably:
a. Surrey’s lobbyist registry was put into place to provide the citizens of Surrey
with access to information about persons who attempt to influence decision-
making through the use of paid lobbyists in relation to land use development

activities, and to promote transparency concerning attempts to influence
Municipal decision making;
b. Lobbyists voluntarily file a form with the City Clerk’s Office with information
including:
 Date qualified as a lobbyist,
 Full name, business phone number and business address,
 Lobbyist’s employer (if applicable) business phone number and
address,
 Nature and purpose of employer’s business,
 Client’s name, business phone number and business mailing address,
 Nature and purpose of client’s business,
 Development application number and description of proposal / project
for which lobbyist was retained to represent the client;
c. There is minimal cost to the City Clerk’s Office for the administration of the
registry. As such the City of Surrey does not have a line item in its budget for
the lobbyist registry;
d. Policy does not apply to federal, provincial, or municipal elected
representatives or their staff, Indigenous peoples and bands, or submissions
on behalf of a personal matter related to a constituent;
e. Surrey’s policy requires registration only for lobbyists advocating on behalf of
applicants for a rezoning, a development permit or an official community plan
amendment;
f. Since inception, the number of lobbyists who have voluntarily registered has
steadily increased. The list includes architects, engineers,
telecommunications companies, builders, and real estate agents;
g. Since the Policy is voluntary, it places the onus on the lobbyist to register.
Surrey has no method of enforcement. There are no consequences to City
staff or members of Council if dealing with unregistered lobbyists;
10. In addition to Surrey, the City of Kelowna has its own voluntary municipal lobbyist
registry. Voluntary municipal lobbyist registries also exist in Edmonton and
Winnipeg, and dozens of Ontario cities where there is a desire to instil public
confidence and support open and transparent decision-making processes.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council supports public access to information about lobbyists and their
activities to ensure transparency and accountability in government decision-
making, and commits to the creation of voluntary lobbyist registry for the City of
Vancouver.
B. THAT Council direct staff to prepare a new voluntary Vancouver lobbyist
registration policy, based on the Surrey model, appropriately tailored to
Vancouver and the Vancouver Charter, including specific requirements:

Standing Committee on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, October 23, 2024 22
a. The definition of “lobby” in relation to a paid lobbyist means to communicate
verbally or in writing, or to meet with an elected official or their staff for the
purpose of influencing a decision of Council.
b. The policy does not apply to a verbal or written communication:
i. Sent to all of Council through Mayor & Council correspondence;
ii. Made as part of a Council meeting, public hearing, committee
meeting, or similar proceeding where it is part of the public record;
iii. Regarding a matter that is outside of the City’s jurisdiction; or
iv. Made in response to a written request from a Council member or the
City of Vancouver for comment on a matter that would otherwise fall
under the definition of lobby.
C. THAT Council direct staff to separately report back on how a new Vancouver
lobbyist registration policy could be further strengthened under the existing
statutory power in the Vancouver Charter, by appending the definitions and
conditions of the voluntary lobbyist registry to the Code of Conduct By-law
12886, and for application of the prescribed complaint and resolution procedures
under Part 6, for Council members who meet with un-registered lobbyists.

WHEREAS
1. The Gastown and Hastings Crossing areas, have expressed an urgent need to
address issues of street disorder and crime. They are seeking immediate actions
for a safer, more secure environment for all;
2. The safety, security, and well-being of the areas’ residents, businesses, and
visitors is of the utmost importance to the City of Vancouver;
3. A sense of safety and security is essential not only for the daily lives of the areas’
residents but also for the vitality of their business community, which relies on an
environment where individuals feel comfortable living, working, shopping, and
visiting;
4. The establishment of a community policing centre for the Gastown and Hastings
Crossing areas has been identified as a key step toward increasing law
enforcement visibility and enhancing the sense of security and safety for all
community members;
5. Community policing centres are community-led and play a vital role in building
trust and fostering positive relationships between police and the local community.
This collaborative approach to public safety and policing efforts ensures efforts
are more effective and achieve the desired objectives;
6. Given Gastown and Hastings Crossing are two of four Downtown Eastside
neighbourhoods, it is crucial to approach policing in these areas in a thoughtful,
sensitive, and balanced manner that recognizes the complexities of the
neighbourhoods and ensures respect and compassion for vulnerable populations
are central to the safety strategies implemented;
7. Given that a neighbourhood's overall economic and social health is closely tied to
its sense of security and safety, a long-term strategy that leads to lasting,
sustainable safety and well-being for all community members is therefore
needed. Addressing the root causes of the challenges faced by the area must

MOVED by Councillor Fry
SECONDED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
WHEREAS
1. Since 1971, the city-owned road right-of-way and ersatz greenspace on the east
side of Gore Avenue between Keefer and Union Street consisting of a non-titled
non-parcel north of East Georgia Street and a non-titled parcel south of East
Georgia Street (722 Gore Avenue) has been maintained for the benefit of local
residents with Park Board groundskeeping funded by the city;
2. The greenspace, a vestige of a highway on-ramp right of way, was created after
the successful community-led fight to stop the freeway through Chinatown,
Hogan’s Alley and Strathcona. Designed by Justice and Webb Landscape
Architects, the space included an arboreal path and grandstand, but over time
has suffered civic neglect and uncertain status. At current, the de facto
community park includes a walking path with trees and benches at the northern
end, the southern portion has 21 mature trees including a rare giant Sequoia;
3. Posted on June 2024, the Vancouver Tree Canopy Assessment (2022)7
identified Strathcona as the only neighbourhood with tree canopy cover of less
than 10 per cent. Across Gore Avenue in Chinatown, the tree canopy is less than
five per cent and the heat island effect is magnified, creating an unsafe
environment for the many vulnerable residents, in particular seniors living in older
supportive and SRO housing;
4. The Strathcona, Chinatown and Hogan’s Alley areas are collectively the sites of
historic displacement and marginalization8, and today still home to significant
vulnerable populations many of whom lack access to quality greenspace. St
Paul’s Hospital campus and anticipated redevelopment of Hogan’s Alley block
(bordered by Union, Prior, Gore and Main) will exacerbate need for more local
serving public greenspace;
5. Recent plans for a temporary fire hall at 722 Gore9 that would have seen tree
loss and impermeable resurfacing have been paused pending a re-evaluation of

location options. Community concerns prompted by the proposal articulated the
importance and need for more (not less) neighbourhood greenspace;
6. The Vancouver Board of Park and Recreation, on October 7, 2024,10 declared its
interest and intent to preserve the green space at the northeast corner of
Gore/Union, initially under care and custody of the Park Board, and eventually as
a permanent park with a request to Mayor and Council to arrange ways and
means to give effect to this interest and intent;
7. In a memo dated April 19, 2024 11 Council were supplied with background
information on the tools to designate parks under the Vancouver Charter,
including:
a. Permanent Public Park under Section 488(1);
b. Temporary Public Park under Section 488(2); or
c. Custody, Care and Management (“CCM”) under Section 488(3).
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
THAT Council direct staff to report back with recommendations for park designation of
the city-owned sites inclusive of 722 Gore and adjoining right of way to Keefer Street,
and with considerations for the most appropriate and expeditious form of designation
under the authority of the Vancouver Charter.
