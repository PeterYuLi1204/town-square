At the Standing Committee on Policy and Strategic Priorities meeting on June 9, 2022,
(reconvened from May 18, 25, 26, 31, 2022), due to time constraints, Council referred the
remainder of debate and decision on the above-noted item to the Standing Committee on Policy
and Strategic Priorities meeting on June 22, 2022, as the first item of business.
AMENDMENT MOVED by Councillor Fry
THAT the following be added as U:
THAT, subject to Council approval of the Broadway Plan, Council direct staff to
work with senior government, industry, and tenant groups as applicable to
develop new policies to monitor and protect affordability found in existing
purpose-built rental buildings that considers and ensures:
a) Creating an accurate rent roll for purpose built and secondary rentals in
the Broadway Plan area;
b) Rent stabilization for existing units based on rent rolls, tying rent to units;
c) Rate of change analysis and reporting in order to monitor and mitigate
any increase in renovictions, tenant clear-outs, and the effectiveness of
new tenant relocation and protection measures; and
d) Amending the Empty Home Tax property status declaration for multi-unit
purpose-built rental to list all tenancy agreements, and replacing the
current exemption that requires only one unit within the building be rented
for six months with new requirements proportional to current vacancy
rates in the City of Vancouver.
amended
At 9:51 am, during discussion on the amendment above, Mayor Stewart rose on a point of order
under Section 8.7(a) of the Procedure By-law noting the amendment seems to not be
compatible with the purposes and objects of the Vancouver Charter including the good rule and
government of the City, as it could put the City at a disadvantage to have to create a brand new
department. Following a short recess, Chair Carr ruled the amendment in order as the proposed
work falls within the scope of the Broadway Plan.

At the Council meeting on June 21, 2022, Council referred the following motion to the

order to hear from speakers, followed by debate and decision.
MOVED by Councillor Dominato
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, June 22, 2022 22
1. The Vancouver Civic Theatres Board is committed to supporting the vitality,
accessibility and financial health of Vancouver’s largest suite of city-owned live
performance venues as well as its vibrant arts scene;
2. Vancouver Civic Theatres’ operations and revenues have been severely
impacted by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, as has the entire cultural
community and downtown core;
3. The Vancouver Civic Theatres Board has embarked on a significant internal
visioning process to review and re-imagine the future of these venues;
4. The Vancouver Civic Theatres Board has produced a summary document,
"Vancouver Civic Theatres 2021 Visioning Road Map,” which outlines the results
of this process and presents a preliminary plan for potential next steps for its
realization;
5. The Vancouver Civic Theatres Board recognizes this plan reflects an internal
visioning process intended to spark dialogue among stakeholders that now
needs be shared with the broader for community for input. Further, that this
critical stakeholder engagement process is not within the Vancouver Civic
Theatres Board’s purview;
6. At the Thursday, April 21, 2022, meeting of the Vancouver Civic Theatres Board,
a motion specific to the Board’s visioning process and the 2021 Visioning Road
Map was unanimously supported with several recommended follow up actions for
Vancouver City Council to consider, namely:
• Vancouver City Council reviews and considers the ideas and projects
proposed in “Vancouver Civic Theatres 2021 Visioning Road Map” document
produced by the Vancouver Civic Theatres Board;
• Vancouver City Council requests that City Management and Cultural Services
review the Vancouver Civic Theatres 2021 Visioning Road Map to assess
how these projects align with current and future strategies outlined in the
City’s Culture I Shift plan, and that they develop a budget for initial seed
funding to address next steps, including initial stakeholder consultation,
feasibility studies, preliminary business planning, and relevant research.
These funds could potentially be repaid through funding sources outlined in
the Visioning Road Map;
• Once the above-noted staff review has been completed, Vancouver City
Council appoints a steering committee to explore and lead major performing
arts capital projects congruent with the goals outlined in the Vancouver Civic
Theatres 2021 Visioning Road Map; and
• Suggested committee membership would include representation from City
management, Cultural Services, City Planning, Vancouver Civic Theatres,
key performing arts stakeholders, and other members at large with skills and
experience in theatre/cultural management, fundraising and development,
urban planning and architecture.

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, June 22, 2022 23
7. The City’s cultural ecology and cultural community are evolving and undergoing
major changes, many of which are presently under review and/or being
addressed by City policies and programs; and
8. Downtown Vancouver has faced unprecedented challenges as a result of the
coronavirus pandemic, which call for a revitalization that renews the City Centre
as a compelling area to work, live, and visit, regenerating economic activity and
reinforcing our cultural vibrancy.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council receive for information and consideration the Vancouver Civic
Theatres 2021 Visioning Road Map and the related recommendations from the

could be implemented as part of the City’s Culture | Shift Strategy and as part of
any future strategies related to arts and culture facilities;
FURTHER THAT staff be directed to report back to Council by the end of Q4
2023 with recommendations and options for Council to consider with respect to

5. Strengthening the City of Vancouver’s Ethical Purchasing Policy (Member’s
Motion B.4)
At the Council meeting on June 21, 2022, Council referred the following motion to the
Standing Committee on Policy and Strategic Priorities meeting on June 22, 2022, in
order to hear from speakers, followed by debate and decision.
The Committee heard from seven speakers in support of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Boyle
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. When Vancouver City Council adopted a policy on ethical purchasing in 2005,
the then City Council said:
“The goal of the City of Vancouver’s Ethical Purchasing Policy (EPP) is to ensure
that all suppliers to the City meet, at a minimum, the performance standards
outlined in the Supplier Code of Conduct, which includes core labour conventions
of the International Labour Organization (ILO). It demonstrates a commitment to
sustainability by seeking to ensure safe and healthy workplaces for the people

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, June 22, 2022 24
who make products for the City of Vancouver, where human and civil rights are
respected. The EPP also ensures that purchasing activities are aligned with the
City’s Mission Statement and Values. The policy establishes an avenue whereby
complaints of abuses in workplaces that are involved in the manufacture of
apparel and agricultural products purchased by the City can be made to the City.
The City will determine the level and the degree necessary to investigate and act
upon complaints. The policy is not intended to interfere with the City’s collective
agreements.”;
2. The complaint-driven stance adopted by the City of Vancouver so far has led in
at least two known instances of suppliers approved to sell to the City being
involved in serious labour abuses without the City knowing about these serious
breaches. Two Haitian factories that appear on the City of Vancouver’s list of
suppliers as of March 2021 failed to forward health insurance fees deducted from
worker salaries to the appropriate health insurance program, leading to seriously
ill workers being denied health care and subsequently dying. These deaths and
the abuse of worker rights that led to them did not become known to the City of
Vancouver until concerned citizens brought this lethal oversight to the attention of
City. There is, currently, no reason to be certain that other suppliers on the City’s
list have not committed similar or more egregious abuses of workers;
3. The experience of cities like San Francisco point to the usefulness of an active
approach including regular liaison with unions and human rights advocates in
source countries in enforcing ethical purchasing. And point to the usefulness of
contracting some elements of policy enforcement to a specialist non profit NGO
such as the Workers’ Rights Consortium, which has performed well for San
Francisco;
4. Over the life of the Ethical Purchasing Policy (EPP), the City has not retained the
services of an outside body to ensure that suppliers the City purchases from are
in compliance with the EPP; and
5. The current approach relies on suppliers to proactively provide information which
may be at odds with their business interest.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council directs staff, within three months to obtain cost estimates from
organizations such as the Workers’ Rights Consortium to:
i. Monitor the list of City of Vancouver apparel suppliers and advise the
City if any of these suppliers are in breach of the City’s EPP;
ii. Advise the City as to whether or not any potential suppliers the City is
considering contracting with are in compliance with the City’s EPP.
B. THAT Council direct staff to report back with recommendations on creating a
volunteer ethical purchasing oversight committee made up of members drawn
from local unions and human rights Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and
other relevant expertise. With the intention that the committee would liaise
regularly with the City of Vancouver’s Procurement and Supply Chain
Management staff, as well as with relevant labour and human rights

organizations and report annually to council on enforcement of the City’s ethical
purchasing policy.

absent supplier compliance, recommend the removal of the non-compliant
supplier from the City of Vancouver's approved supplier list.

incurred by the Mayor or by the Mayor's staff, while carrying out eligible activities,
and may include” – among other things – communications expenses, fees for
consulting or other contracted services, costs of research and information
gathering, and costs of community outreach and events;
4. PART 7 of By-law No. 11529 (Councillor Discretionary Expenses) states under
section 7.2 that “Councillor discretionary expenses are eligible expenses if
incurred by one or more Councillors while carrying out constituency activities
related to eligible activities and not provided for elsewhere in this By-law, and
may include…”
(a) communications expenses
(b) fees for consulting or other contracted services

Minutes, Wednesday, June 22, 2022 29
(c) costs of research and information gathering
(d) costs of community outreach and events
5. Provincially, each Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) receives an annual
office allowance to run the day-to-day operations of their respective constituency
offices. This office allowance covers operating expenses, including office staff
payroll and discretionary expenses;
6. Similar to the discretionary funds allocated to the Mayor and Councillors under
By-law No. 11529, Members of the Provincial Legislature are able to use their
constituency office allowance for communications with constituents, “which can
be in the form of a newsletter, household flyer, or advertisement (e.g., print,
online, radio, or television)”;
7. The content of advertisements and messages sent by Members of the Provincial
Legislature to their constituents is specifically, and unambiguously, restricted “to
announcing or reporting on constituency office activities, how to contact the
Member, the role played by the Member in the legislative process, and services
provided by the Member to constituents. Members may not use constituency
office resources or funds to distribute or mail physical or digital content which
promotes partisan or political messages or solicits financial support.”;
8. Unlike the clearly defined prohibitions on Members of the Provincial Legislature,
whereby they are not allowed to use constituency office resources or funds “to
distribute or mail physical or digital content which promotes partisan or political
messages or solicits financial support,” the City’s current By-law does not
adequately and clearly define the limits and/or appropriate expenditures and
uses of Mayor and Councillor discretionary funds; and
9. In the absence of clear definitions as to the scope of eligible expenses, which
has proven to be too broad and open to interpretation, the potential exists for
misuse and/or inappropriate use of public dollars for partisan purposes –
perceived or otherwise – which can only serve to erode trust in government and
the integrity of government processes.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to review By-law No. 11529
(Mayor and Councillor Expenses), with reference to Parts 5 and 7, and make
recommendations to strengthen the By-law with respect to eligible and prohibited use of
discretionary funds;
FURTHER THAT Council direct staff to report back with their analysis and
recommendations by or before the end of Q4 2022.
CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY (Vote No. 08609)
(Councillors De Genova, Hardwick, and Mayor Stewart absent for the vote)
The Committee adjourned at 10:01 pm.
