SECONDED by Councillor Carr
THAT Council approves the following recommendation of the United Nations Declaration
on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) Task Force:
WHEREAS
1. The Musqueam, Squamish, and Tsleil-Waututh Peoples are the original stewards
of the lands known as the City of Vancouver, and they have throughout history
and to this day lived in relationship with their lands and waters with their own
distinct cultures, governance systems, laws, and ways of life;
2. The City of Vancouver (“the City”) voted unanimously on June 24, 2014 to
acknowledge that the City is on the unceded territory of the Musqueam,

Council Meeting
Minutes, October 25, 2022 7
Squamish, and Tsleil-Waututh Peoples, and the City adopted a Reconciliation
Framework on July 8, 2014;
3. Rights and title holders in the City of Vancouver are the Musqueam, Squamish,
and Tsleil-Waututh within the meaning of UNDRIP. The City of Vancouver, as a
City of Reconciliation, has the responsibility to recognize the rights and title of
Musqueam, Squamish and Tsleil-Waututh and to repudiate colonial concepts of
Doctrine of Discovery and terra nullius1;
4. Many Indigenous people from other territories reside in Vancouver, on
Musqueam, Squamish, and Tsleil-Waututh territories and as Indigenous people
also have Indigenous rights within UNDRIP. The City of Vancouver has the
responsibility to provide rights-based programming and services to the diverse
Indigenous populations living in the city, in ways which include and respect the
authority of Musqueam, Squamish, and Tsleil-Waututh as the rights and title
holders of these lands;
5. The UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (“UNDRIP”) was
adopted by the UN General Assembly on 13 September 2007, which provides
the framework for reconciliation, healing, and the enjoyment of rights by
Indigenous Peoples; establishes a universal framework of minimum standards for
the survival, dignity, well-being and rights of the world's Indigenous Peoples;
addresses both individual and collective rights; cultural rights and identity; rights
to education, health, employment, language, and others; outlaws discrimination
against Indigenous Peoples and promotes their full and effective participation in
all matters that concern them;
6. Canada’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission (“TRC”) Calls to Action and the
MMIWG and 2S Calls for Justice call on all levels of government to adopt
UNDRIP as the framework for reconciliation;
7. In 2021, City Council voted to create the UNDRIP “Task Force on Implementing
UNDRIP in the City of Vancouver”, in partnership with the Musqueam Indian
Band, Squamish Nation, and Tsleil-Waututh Nation to develop Calls to Action on
how the City can implement UNDRIP as the framework for Indigenous relations
and reconciliation;
8. Since that time, the Task Force has been working to develop the City of
Vancouver’s UNDRIP Strategy outlining Calls to Action for the implementation of
UNDRIP at the municipal level, as the minimum standard for the survival, dignity,
well-being and rights of Indigenous Peoples.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council endorse the Task Force Report dated
October 25, 2022, entitled “Report of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of
Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) Task Force”, (“City of Vancouver’s UNDRIP Strategy”)
1 Such concepts, in effect since the 1400s, declared that non-Christian lands were ‘empty’ and were used
to justify colonization and the dispossession of Indigenous Peoples and their lands, and the imposition of
western laws, governance, and economic systems.

and direct staff to determine what is needed to implement each Call to Action, and report

Tsleil-Waututh, to develop a community-based UNDRIP engagement process with the

UNDRIP Strategy”) to the Board of Parks and Recreation, Vancouver Police Board,
Vancouver Public Library Board, and Vancouver School Board and encourage them to
adopt the findings of the Task Force and collaborate in cross-departmental
implementation to ensure their own policies and procedures align with UNDRIP;
AND FURTHER THAT Council accept these Calls to Action as a pathway forward to
building good relations on these Musqueam, Squamish, and Tsleil-Waututh lands,
guiding the City of Vancouver to take all measures necessary to ensure that its policies,
laws, practices, and standards are consistent with the United Nations Declaration on the
Rights of Indigenous Peoples.
