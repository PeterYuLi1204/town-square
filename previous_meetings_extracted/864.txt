UNFINISHED BUSINESS
1. City of Vancouver Responsible Divestment from Fossil Fuels
At the Standing Committee on Policy and Strategic Priorities meeting on November 27, 2019,
the Committee concluded hearing from speakers to the motion and referred debate and
decision to the Council meeting on January 21, 2020, as Unfinished Business.
MOVED by Councillor Carr
SECONDED by Councillor Swanson
WHEREAS
1. The 2016 Union of BC Municipalities (UBCM) report, Primer on Fossil Fuel
Divestment and the Municipal Pension Plan (MPP), noted that “the MPP
imperative is to provide income security for retired members” and “Divestment
may compromise our investment strategy, increase risks and costs, and
negatively affect our clients’ investment returns”;
2. The B.C. Municipal Pension Plan is managed by British Columbia Investment
Management Corporation (“BCI”), an asset manager that encourages
responsible investing principles and is one of the founding members to the
United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment in 2006. BCI has noted that
their responsible investment approach is that being an investor and influencing
change is more effective than to divest. Other investment firms such as Caisse

Council Meeting
Minutes, January 21, 2020 5
Quebec are moving more aggressively to manage the impact and risks of fossil
fuels by reducing their holdings and encouraging investment in renewable
energy;
3. In May 2016, Council adopted a Responsible Investment Screening Process for
the City’s investment portfolio. The recommended screening process for
investing in Canadian banks and credit unions uses a typical structure of
environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) factors within a responsible
investing perspective;
4. In February 2018, Council directed staff to report back on “what the implications
would be of the City of Vancouver moving its Municipal Finance Authority
(“MFA”) Investments into a fossil-free Socially Responsible Investment (“SRI”)
fund if such a fund is established by the MFA”. Staff reported in March 2018, that
the City does not invest in any MFA pooled investment funds, and therefore
would not have MFA funds to move into a fossil-free SRI fund. Since then, as the
City has been a leader in the responsible investment area, staff have engaged
with MFA to support the creation of MFA pooled investment funds that align with
a fossil free approach and MFA has introduced two new Pooled High Interest
Savings Accounts that meet the short term investment needs of fossil fuel free
investors and will also be introducing an MFA Mortgage Fund which has a small,
greatly reduced exposure to fossil fuel companies. In addition, MFA has been
engaging with asset managers with the view of creating a new short-term bond
fund with a fossil fuel exclusion screen that would exclude securities of
companies directly involved in the extraction, processing and transportation of
coal, oil, or natural gas;
5. In 2017, the Chief Financial Officer of the City signed a letter from the
“Accounting for Sustainability (A4S)” initiative of Chief Financial Officers,
supporting climate-related financial disclosure. The letter specifically commits the
City to “affirm our commitment to support the voluntary recommendations” of the
Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”). In 2018, the City
was the first Canadian municipality to include climate-related financial
disclosures in its annual financial report. The City’s disclosure aligns or partially
aligns with TCFD recommendations, and will continue to improve over time as
the City responds to climate change, and as the field of climate-risk disclosure
evolves. The City is currently working with the City of Toronto, the City of
Montreal, and CPA (Chartered Professional Accountants) Canada to develop
and align standards for other municipalities to follow TCFD disclosures in their
financial reports;
6. In June 2018, the City developed its Green Bond Framework and engaged
Sustainalytics, a global leading provider of Socially Responsible strategies, to
provide a second-party opinion on the City’s alignment with the four core
components of the Green Bond Principles Framework. In October 2018, the City
issued its inaugural Green Bond of $85 million for capital projects that include
investments in renewable energy, energy efficiency, green buildings and clean
transportation (https://vancouver.ca/your-government/investor-relations.aspx);

Council Meeting
Minutes, January 21, 2020 6
7. Since then, with scientific validation of accelerating global warming and the need
to leave fossil fuel reserves in the ground, there has been increasing awareness
of the investment risk related to fossil fuel “stranded assets”. The October 2018
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report calling for rapid
reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, with a window of little more than a
decade to avert catastrophic impacts of climate change, has shifted the rationale
for divesting from an ethical or moral consideration to a financial and fiduciary
argument:
“Divestment, once strictly a moral call to action, is now also seen as the
only prudent financial response to climate risk” 350.org;
8. In January 2019, Council voted unanimously to recognize a global climate
emergency and local climate crisis;
9. In June 2019, noting a B.C. government report that projects the City of
Vancouver will have to spend $1 billion this century to mitigate rising sea levels,
Council approved a motion to write to “the 20 fossil fuel companies with the
highest percentage of greenhouse gas emissions to ask that they be accountable
for their share of climate emergency costs;
10. In October 2019, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, told delegates at a climate
change summit in Copenhagen that big investors such as insurers and pension
funds should cut their investments and focus on renewable energy sources
instead;
11. Divestment is now a rapidly growing worldwide movement. The total sum of
global funds committed to fossil fuel divestment was $52 billion in 2014, $8 trillion
in 2018 and $11 trillion in 2019. In 2019, more than 1,110 funds (including wealth
funds, banks, cities, pension funds and insurance firms) have made divestment
commitments, including Norway’s $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund, the world’s
largest. Caisse Quebec – Quebec’s equivalent to B.C.’s pension fund manager –
has more than $285-billion in assets under management and says it believes it is
the first North American institutional investor to set a carbon target covering all of
its asset classes:
“There are going to be stranded assets associated with climate change.
We don’t want to get caught in those stranded assets … We’re looking for
opportunities because we think it’s good risk management to, over time,
exit those.”
Michael Sabia, President and CEO of Caisse Quebec;
12. The cities-led responsible investment movement is growing. More and more
cities around the world, including New York City, Paris, London, Oslo, Sydney,
Melbourne, Aukland, San Francisco and Seattle, are manifesting their climate
leadership through making a divestment commitment. To support cities in
exploring and developing their divestment and sustainable investment strategies,
the global Cities Climate Leadership Group C40, in close partnership with

Council Meeting
Minutes, January 21, 2020 7
London and New York City, launched the Divest/Invest Forum in September
2018. The Forum is open to any city that seeks to learn more about divestment,
sustainable investment, and other climate-responsive financial strategies; no
actions or commitments are required as a prerequisite to joining.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT City Council direct staff to review and report
back on A to E below, and the Mayor take action on F to H below:
A. A plan that includes defining divestment, options and timelines for how the City
could fully divest from fossil fuels, building on divestment measures taken to date
as well as leading practices related to fossil fuel free investment portfolios.
B. Opportunities to continue to engage the Municipal Finance Authority to create a
fossil fuel free fund that would enable other B.C. municipalities to invest in such a
fund.
C. Bringing a motion to Council for the 2020 meetings of the Lower Mainland Local
Government Association and the Union of B.C. Municipalities (UBCM) to
re-examine the 2016 UBCM Primer on Fossil Fuel Divestment and the Municipal
Pension Plan report, in light of globally changing investment and divestment
strategies.
D. Tasking and resourcing the Vancouver Economic Commission to work with local
businesses and financial regulators to provide and promote resources and
guidelines for local businesses and other private institutions to understand and
apply TCFD (Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures) decision-
making in their work.
E. Evaluating the benefit of the City and Vancouver Economic Commission
participating on the C40 Invest/Divest forum, including attending its March 2020
workshop.
F. The Mayor, on behalf of Council and the City of Vancouver write to the B.C.
Municipal Pension Plan requesting a risk assessment of the plan’s investments
based on carbon exposure, asking the Plan to advise the City on what steps are
being taken to measure and mitigate these risks, and urging the Plan to consider
the long-term impact of global climate emergency and local climate crisis due to
investments in fossil fuel assets and to redeploy funds into green and renewable
assets that are necessary for a sustainable future.
G. The Mayor, on behalf of Council and the City of Vancouver, send a letter to the
Province of BC to encourage them to follow the examples of Canadian
municipalities in developing a model for crown corporations and provincial
agencies to include financial statement disclosures aligned with the TCFD (Task
Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures).
H. The Mayor, on behalf of the City of Vancouver, a C40 City, sign the Global Green
New Deal pledge which was signed by the other C40 mayors at their meeting in
Copenhagen in October of 2019. That pledge includes an “urgent, fundamental

and irreversible transfer of global resources away from fossil fuels and into action
that averts the climate emergency.”

Prior to debate, Councillor De Genova rose on a Point of Order to inquire if the motion was in

3. Designating January 29th as Day of Remembrance and Action on Islamophobia
MOVED by Councillor Swanson
SECONDED by Councillor Boyle
WHEREAS
1. On January 29, 2017, a white gunman entered the Islamic Cultural Centre
mosque in Quebec City and opened fire on dozens of Muslim worshipers;
2. By the time the shooting had ended, six people had been tragically killed and 19
more were injured: Ibrahima Barry, Mamadou Tanou Barry, Khaled Belkacemi,
Aboubaker Thabti, Abdelkrim Hassane, and Azzedine Soufiane lost their lives
that night;
3. Muslim communities across Canada were, and continue to be, affected by this
and other acts of hate, racism, white supremacy, and Islamophobia—including
the anti-Islam rally planned for August 19, 2017, outside Vancouver City Hall;
4. To commemorate January 29, Muslim communities in Vancouver have held
vigils, discussions, and other events, including an annual vigil during evening
prayers at the Vancouver Al-jamia Mosque on 8th Avenue, which is the oldest
mosque in BC;
5. The cities of Toronto, Mississauga, Brampton, Markham, Hamilton, and Windsor
have all designated January 29 as a Day of Remembrance and Action on
Islamophobia. Many municipalities across Canada commemorate the events of
January 29 with their Muslim community partners, and there is a nation-wide
campaign for the federal government to recognize the day nationally
(https://www.january29.ca/about).
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council declare January 29th as a Day of
Remembrance and Action on Islamophobia, adding it to its official observances
calendar;
FURTHER THAT the City of Vancouver acknowledge this day with a proclamation.

Minutes, January 21, 2020 24
4. Preserving Single Room Occupancy Stock Surrounding New St. Paul’s Hospital
Site
MOVED by Councillor Swanson
SECONDED by Councillor Boyle
WHEREAS
1. The new St. Paul’s Hospital development at 1002 Station Street is a $1.9 billion
hospital and health care facility that will include institutional, office, residential,
hotel, and retail uses spanning 1.68 million sq. ft of floor area and that will
eventually employ more than 10,000 people serving 174,000 patients each year.
The 2017 “New St. Paul’s Social Impact Assessment Summary” identified
“increase[d] demand for housing” as a potential impact of the new site;
2. This new site is a 18.4-acre lot just south of Chinatown, within walking distance
of the DTES and Downtown South and located within the Downtown core, which
contains the highest concentration of Single Room Occupancy (SRO) rooms in
the city;
3. Nearby SROs include the Ivanhoe, Cobalt, and Arno hotels, which provide a total
of approximately 230 units;
4. SROs are an essential part of the City’s housing stock. As per the City’s 2017
Single Room Occupancy (SRO) Revitalization Action Plan: “In the context of few
adequate housing options available to those on limited or fixed incomes, Single
Room Occupancy (SRO) hotels play a critical role in Vancouver’s low-income
housing stock as a last resort before homelessness for many of the city’s most
vulnerable tenants.”;
5. Despite the Single Room Accommodation (SRA) By-law (2003), which was
enacted to discourage speculative investment and slow the loss of affordability in
the SRO housing stock, the level of affordability in SROs has declined, putting a
growing number of SROs out of reach for low-income residents. Furthermore,
various city policies—including the Downtown South SRO Replacement Policy
(1991), DTES Housing Plan (2005), Housing and Homelessness Strategy (2012–
2021), DTES Local Area Plan (2014), and Housing Vancouver (2017)—which
require one-to-one replacement of SRO units with self-contained social housing,
have been insufficient to maintain housing options for low-income residents;
6. Since the 2014 changes to the definition of social housing, most social housing
has not been affordable to people on social assistance and basic pensions;
therefore, one-to-one replacement of SRO units with social housing is insufficient
to maintain housing options for low-income residents. One-to-one replacement
can also be bypassed with a SRA replacement fee of $125,000 per unit by the
owner, subject to Council approval;
7. Because of gentrification in the DTES, SROs that were previously affordable to
low-income residents have increased rents and no longer contribute to the low-

Council Meeting
Minutes, January 21, 2020 25
income housing stock. According to the “Replacement, Renewal, and Change:
2015 Survey of Single Room Accommodation & Non-Market Housing in the
Downtown Core” report, the proportion of private SRO rooms renting at or below
the $375 shelter less has decreased by half [since 2009]. Meanwhile, the
proportion of private rooms renting at $451 or more has nearly tripled.”;
8. The 2017 “New St. Paul’s Social Impact Assessment Summary” suggested that
Providence Health Care mitigate potential impact on SROs by “includ[ing] a hotel
on-site to meet the demands of patients, families and visitors”; this was
maintained in the City’s 2017 Policy Statement and subsequent rezoning
approval. However, because this mitigation was linked to the potential impact of
“increas[ing] demand for short-term accommodation,” it will be insufficient in
protecting SROs from the increased demand on and gentrification of all housing
in the area;
9. Real estate agencies are already advertising SROs like the Arno as “lucrative
investment” opportunities due to their proximity to the new St. Paul’s Hospital site
(https://listingsprod.blob.core.windows.net/ourlistings-can/9c0b5f49-51a6-4f62-
a7af-dca61e949457/48ac1ebb-b99f-49e8-a570-63dd5b47c018);
10. The 2017 impact assessment summary also recommended that the City “seek to
secure private SROs.”;
11. If City policies are not strengthened, the social and economic impacts of a
massive development like St. Paul’s could be catastrophic for low-income
residents living in nearby neighbourhoods and could contribute to a growing
number of homeless people in the city.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to report back before
construction begins on the new St. Paul’s Hospital on how to prevent gentrification and
loss of low-rent Single Room Occupancy (SROs) and other low-income housing within
walking distance of the new Hospital site and include consideration of:
a. A public database of SROs and other low-income housing currently being
rented, including rental rates;
b. Increasing the Single Room Accommodation (SRA) replacement fee as
detailed in section 4.8(a) of the SRA By-Law;
c. Mechanisms for establishing restrictions on the rate of change of
low-income housing other than SROs, such as the Fan Tower and East
Hotel.

5. Making it Easier for the Public to Speak at Council Meetings
MOVED by Councillor Swanson
SECONDED by Councillor Fry
WHEREAS
1. It is difficult to predict the timing of when speakers will present to Council at
Council and Standing Committee meetings as there are many variables which
impact the meeting length;
2. Some speakers scheduled to speak during Council and Standing Committee
meetings miss their turn on the speakers list due to this uncertainty;
3. People who have access to vehicles, internet and phone data, childcare, and
other privileges are therefore currently more likely to be able to speak to Council;
4. Some speakers who miss their turn may be able to speak to Council at the
conclusion of the speakers list for that particular agenda item;
5. The Procedure By-law does not specify that speakers who missed their turn
during Council and Standing Committee meetings should be given the
opportunity to be called to speak at the end of the speakers list.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to report back to Council with
proposed amendments to the Procedure By-law to specify that those speakers who are
registered on the speakers list for Council or Standing Committee meetings, and have

6. Aligning the Healthy City Strategy with the UN Sustainable Development Goals
MOVED by Councillor Fry
SECONDED by Councillor Carr
WHEREAS
1. In 2015, Canada, along with all United Nations Member States, adopted the 2030
Agenda for Sustainable Development, which includes 17 Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs). The 17 SDGs are based on the recognition by all
countries, “that ending poverty and other deprivations must go hand-in-hand with
strategies that improve health and education, reduce inequality, and spur
economic growth – all while tackling climate change and working to preserve our
oceans and forests”;
2. While Canada as a whole has adopted the UN’s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
Development and the 17 SDGs, individual cities have no obligation to adhere to
them;
3. The City of Vancouver’s Healthy City Strategy is comprised of 13 long-term goals
and ambitious targets to reach by 2025 centred around ensuring basic needs are
met, fair health and social supports, Living Wage, sustainable transportation,
safety, inclusion and reconciliation, and shared leadership;
4. Vancouver’s Healthy City Strategy shares a number of similarities with the UN
2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 SDGs. This alignment
provides an opportunity for Vancouver to contribute to, and benefit from, work
already underway by the international initiative;
5. Vancouver would be the first large city in Canada to adopt the 17 Sustainable
Development Goals and align its work with the UN’s 2030 Agenda for
Sustainable Development.

Council Meeting
Minutes, January 21, 2020 28
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to review the 17 Sustainable Development Goals

sustainable agriculture;
3. Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages;
4. Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong
learning opportunities for all;
5. Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls;
6. Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation
for all;
7. Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for
all;

7. Election Finance: Transparent Funding in Local Politics
MOVED by Councillor Fry
SECONDED by Councillor Bligh
WHEREAS
1. Elections, election campaigns, referendums, and political operations should have
transparent and compliant contributor funding so elected officials are free from
real or perceived potential conflicts of interest, which undermine their duty to
represent the people they were elected to serve;
2. The federal and provincial levels of government have laws regarding political
financing which apply at all times and require that all political contributions be
made by individuals, that individuals have yearly contribution limits, and that
political parties must make annual public disclosures reporting received
contributions and their contributors;
3. In 2017 the B.C. legislature amended the Local Elections Campaign Financing
Act (LECFA), banning special interest and corporate political donations at the
local government level during an election year, placing limits on contributions and
mandating public disclosures. However, the LECFA only applies to electoral
organizations and candidates during an election year for the specific purpose of
campaigning, or the last 28 days before the election in the case of a third party
sponsor;
4. The LECFA does not regulate local electoral organizations in non-election years
or during an election year for their normal activities that are not part of their
election campaigns. Local electoral organizations have separate operating bank
accounts for these purposes and can accept unlimited donations from
corporations and special interests. The LECFA regulations do not require any
public disclosures of electoral organization operating bank accounts, nor do they
place maximum donation limits, or prevent corporations and special interests
from contributing to municipal political organizations;
5. Local Elector Organizations can have a significant impact and influence on local
politics, and on who becomes an elected official. This happens both during a
campaign and outside of campaign periods. Extending the LECFA contribution
restrictions, annual reporting and disclosure requirements, and including the
electoral organization operating account would create a level playing field for all
electoral organizations, improve transparency and limit contributions to compliant
BC residents only;
6. Third party sponsors can also have a significant impact and influence on local
politics and on who becomes an elected official or on a ballot question. In the
2018 Vancouver local election there were examples of significant unreported
third party spending prior to the election, which ended only 28 days before the
election, notwithstanding the intent of the LECFA;

7. The June 2019 City of Vancouver-convened volunteer-led Independent Election
Task Force on Campaign Finance Regulations 1 encouraged the City of
Vancouver to strongly urge the provincial government to improve upon the
existing campaign finance laws, along with specific recommendations:
7.1. To enhance transparency in campaign financing, require all donations to
candidates, elector organizations and third parties to be donated to a
centralized portal run by Elections BC with real time disclosure of
donations.
7.2. THAT the Independent Elections Task Force be reconvened to review the
following policy proposals, which have not previously been considered by
Council, and provide recommendations regarding: Appropriate regulation
of third-party groups wishing to engage on policy during municipal
elections; The suggestion that contributions to candidates running with
elector organizations to be in line with contributions to candidates running
as independents.;
8. The October 2019 Elections BC Report of the Chief Electoral Officer
2 recommendations on Improving Accessibility, Transparency and Compliance
included the following:
8.1. An elector organization is an organization that endorses or intends to
endorse a candidate in an election.
8.2. Require elector organizations to register with Elections BC and file annual
disclosure statements including reports of all financial transactions,
similar to those filed by provincial political parties. Maintain the
membership requirement (50 members) for elector organizations as
prescribed by s. 93(2)(a) of the Local Government Act.;
9. Political finance regulations are the cornerstone of responsible government.
Contribution limits and transparency requirements are necessary safeguards
which prevent corruption and undue influence and ensure accountability of
elected officials to the public.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council affirms a commitment to full and transparent reporting of financial
contributions to elector organizations and candidates both during a campaign
and outside of campaign periods, including contributions to operating expenses.
B. THAT Council reconvene the Independent Election Task Force, to review policy
questions laid out under the report’s Current Mandate proposal.
C. THAT Council direct staff to submit the following resolution along with the above
preamble (articles 3, 8) for consideration at the Lower Mainland Local
Government Association and/or working with other municipalities to present at
Union of BC Municipalities:

Council Meeting
