2. Protecting Rental Housing Stock Along Arterial Streets
MOVED by Councillor Swanson
SECONDED by Councillor Hardwick
WHEREAS
1. The City of Vancouver has a Rental Housing Stock Official Development Plan
(ODP) that was most recently updated in June 2018;
2. The Rental Housing Stock ODP states that:
Council has concerns about preserving the existing rental housing stock because it
continues to be some of the most affordable and secure rental housing in the city,
compared to the relatively high rents of newly-constructed rental housing. In
Vancouver, the existing stock of low-rise, wood-frame market rental buildings,
largely constructed before 1980, makes up over 80 per cent of the city’s purpose-
built rental housing stock and has rents that are nearly 30 per cent lower than
newly-constructed rental housing. Located in the zoning districts, which are some of
the city’s most desirable neighborhoods, this stock has come under redevelopment
pressure in recent years, driven by housing price growth and development
opportunities. The key to preserving this affordability requires policies and programs
that aim to protect and renew the city’s rental stock;
3. The Rental Housing Stock ODP requires one to one replacement of existing rental
units in some zones, but neglects to include the C-2 zones that currently have
significant numbers of existing rentals that are increasingly coming under
redevelopment pressure;
4. Staff is not currently considering expanding the Rental Housing Stock ODP in their
work plan and we could lose numerous units of rental housing if we wait too long;
5. We need to reduce land speculation along arterials as the City Plan process takes
place.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT
A. THAT Council instruct staff to prepare a by-law that amends the Rental Housing
Stock Official Development Plan (ODP) to add C-2 zones in the definition of zoning
districts in section 1.1 and bring it forward for Public Hearing within four weeks of
approval of this motion;
FURTHER THAT if, after a Public Hearing, such amending by-law is enacted,
Council treat this as an interim change to be revisited upon completion of the
City-wide plan.
B. THAT Council direct staff to, in the meantime, investigate alternatives for best
preserving rental housing stock in C-2, C-3A, and all RT zones, and to report back
as soon as possible.

3. Reducing Truck Pollution in Clark-Knight Corridor and Other City Streets
MOVED by Councillor Swanson
SECONDED by Councillor Carr
WHEREAS
1. Homes, schools and businesses lining Vancouver’s Clark-Knight Corridor are
exposed to as much or more traffic pollution than neighbourhoods closest to North
America’s busiest highway, the 401 north of Toronto, according to a July 2018
study by University of Toronto professors in collaboration with Environment and
Climate Change Canada, the Ontario Ministry of Environment, Conservation and
Parks, and Metro Vancouver;
2. The researchers put the blame for the high levels of traffic pollution along the
Clark-Knight Corridor, which has 10 times less traffic than the 401, on the high
number of older, heavy-duty diesel trucks travelling back and forth to the Port of
Vancouver;

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, May 28, 2019 22
3. Exposure to high levels of traffic pollution is linked to increased risk of residents and
workers developing respiratory diseases, such as asthma and heart disease,
according to Health Canada. Of particular danger is soot, which is indicative of
diesel exhaust, a carcinogen associated with lung cancer;
4. The study’s authors warned that elevated levels of traffic pollution can be detected
as far as 250 metres from major roads, putting millions across the country and
thousands living in Vancouver at risk of suffering serious health issues from living
on or near major roads;
5. A 2017 study by a professor in UBC’s school of population and public health found
Canada ranked third the highest rate per 100,000 of new cases of childhood asthma
with traffic pollution responsible for about 20% of the cases, indicating that Metro
Vancouver guidelines for pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide may not be strong
enough to prevent disease;
6. In 2017, the Clark Drive air quality monitoring station was the only one in Metro
Vancouver that failed to meet the region’s standards to limit nitrogen dioxide
emissions;
7. Vancouver’s high housing costs and low vacancy rates mean that it’s the residents
with the lowest incomes, especially families with children and seniors, who end up
living near the Clark-Knight Corridor, putting them at risk of serious health
consequences;
8. The City of Vancouver’s planning and zoning policies as well as the cost of land
have historically favoured putting social housing, multi-family projects, purpose-built
rentals and now modular housing along arterial routes, exposing exponentially more
people to the hazards of traffic pollution;
9. Environment and Climate Change Canada plans to step up air-quality monitoring
across the country; the BC government is developing initiatives to cut greenhouse
gas emissions, including new standards for fuels and incentive programs to upgrade
emission controls for older diesel trucks; and, the Port of Vancouver, TransLink and
the trucking industry are investigating cleaner, alternative fuel options for heavy
trucks;
10. The City of Vancouver is participating in C40 Cities Climate Change Leadership
Group initiatives, including its Freight Academy, to tackle these issues while
developing the City’s Climate Emergency Response; and is committed to
transitioning to 100 % renewal energy before 2050;
11. New buildings along major roads in the city now include mechanisms to reduce
noise and air pollution on balconies and outdoor courtyards.

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, May 28, 2019 23
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council request that the Mayor and Vancouver’s Metro Vancouver delegates
to:
1) seek an update from Metro Vancouver on progress made on its Air Quality
and Climate Change Plan; and
2) initiate actions to strengthen the region’s guidelines for permitted pollutants
such as nitrogen dioxide.
B. THAT Council direct staff to investigate the status of actions the Port of Vancouver,
the BC Government, TransLink, Transport Canada and the trucking industry are
considering to develop fuel options that reduce emissions from heavy trucks using
the Clark-Knight Corridor and other heavy truck routes and report back what actions
Council can take to ensure speedy implementation.
C. THAT Council direct staff to support Council-led motions to be submitted to the next
Union of BC Municipalities and the Federation of Canadian Municipalities meetings
to seek support for significant strengthening of provincial and federal regulations
restricting traffic pollution, particularly of the particulates (soot) emitted by heavy
trucks as well as requiring fuel alternatives that significantly reduce pollution on
major roads.
D. THAT Council direct staff, as part of the city wide planning process, to examine the
city’s zoning, building codes, and planning policies and practices, such as
prioritizing placement of multi-family buildings on arterials, to determine that the
same standards of health and safety are applied equally to all residents.
E. THAT Council direct staff to investigate methods to protect future housing
developments on the Clark-Knight Corridor and other major truck routes until the
City can ensure that the health of residents will not be unduly compromised.
F. THAT Council direct staff to seek recommendations from Vancouver Coastal Health
and Metro Vancouver for measures residents of existing housing can take to best
mitigate the impact of traffic pollution such as improved air filters, sound proofing,
air purifiers, that might help existing residents mitigate the impact of traffic pollution,
including fully informing residents of the dangers of eating garden produce, leaving
windows open.
G. THAT Council direct staff to inform the Vancouver School Board of these actions
and work with the VSB determine the impact of ever-increasing traffic pollution on
the three elementary schools most directly affected (Fleming, Queen Alexandra and
McBride).

4. Punjabi Market at Fifty: Celebrating the Past and Planning for the Future
MOVED by Councillor Fry
SECONDED by Councillor Carr
WHEREAS
1. Sikhism is a religion that originated during the 15th century in the Punjab region of
India. Today, over 150,000 Metro Vancouverites identify as Sikh;
2. The first wave of Sikh immigration to Vancouver occurred in 1904. Despite many
historic injustices and institutionalized racism, in 1947 Sikhs were given the right to
vote and become Canadian citizens;
3. The Punjabi Market is a 3-block commercial district along Main Street between 48th
and 51st Avenues that has been a destination for South Asian culture and
commerce since Sucha Singh Claire opened a sari and fabric shop in the area on
May 31, 1970;
4. The Punjabi Market, also known as Little India was the first and largest South Asian
Market outside of South Asia and has historically included several Indian
restaurants, sweet shops, jewellery stores, clothing stores, grocers, as well as other
businesses catering to the South Asian community, local neighbourhood and
tourists;
5. Vancouver was home to the first and largest Vaisakhi celebration outside of Punjab,
traveling between Ross Street Temple and Punjabi Market, at its height, there were
over 300 shops in the area. Punjabi Market was the first place in the world (outside
of South Asia) to have Punjabi on street signs;
6. In recent years, the Punjabi Market has been struggling, and new construction and
residential development has the potential to transform the area. Community
concerns with regard to public realm, street level retail, and built form called for
more comprehensive and collaborative planning for the future of Punjabi Market;
7. In 2016, responding to community concerns, Vancouver City Council directed staff
to examine Chapter 23 of the Sunset Community Vision – “Main Street Shopping
Area/Punjabi Market” and noted “a robust plan needs to be in place to preserve and
sustain Punjabi Market for future generations.”;

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, May 28, 2019 25
8. In 2017 the City commissioned Retail Business Study of the Punjabi Market Area of
Vancouver (LOCO BC, Masala) which was delivered in March 2018;
9. In April 2018, staff proposed an Area Management Plan that would include the
creation of an area Statement of Significance (including heritage values and key
character defining elements) along with a local working group and strategies and
actions for regeneration of Punjabi Market;
10. In November 2018, Vancouver City Council directed staff to expedite the
development of a City-wide planning process, that would help to determine the
shape of our neighbourhoods, guided by inclusion, heritage, and enjoyable
well-designed gathering places, among other things;
11. The health and vitality of Vancouver's communities is one of the reasons the city is
considered one of the best places on earth to live. City staff routinely advise Council
on polices, strategies, and initiatives that meet the needs of Vancouver's
multicultural and diverse communities.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council affirms that the Punjabi Market shopping area is an area with historic
significance and present day importance.
B. THAT the Mayor determine May 31, 2020, and the occasion of its 50th Anniversary
as “Punjabi Market Day”.
C. THAT Council direct staff to review work to date, including the Sunset Community
Vision, Retail Business Study of the Punjabi Market Area of Vancouver, and work to

occasion of the 50th Anniversary, including but not limited to public realm
improvements, and report back by Q4 2019.
E. THAT Council direct staff to report back by Q4 2019, with budget and resources for
