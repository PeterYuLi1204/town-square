MOVED by Mayor Stewart
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS

the City of Vancouver has been at the forefront of efforts to increase access to
information, including establishing the first open data policy for a major city in
Canada;

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, December 5 and 12, 2018 10
2. Lobbyist registries are intended to provide a public record that is accessible to
residents of interactions between public servants, elected officials and lobbyists
and to allow for rules regarding lobbyists to be enforced;
3. Previous Councils have repeatedly asked staff to investigate options for creating
a municipal lobbyist registry between 2006 and 2017;
4. British Columbia does not currently allow municipalities to use the provincial
lobbyist registry nor does it extend the legal authorities municipalities would need
to enforce lobbyist rules with a local registry;
5. In 2017, City staff produced a memo on February 8, 2017 for the previous council
outlining options for how the Province can provide the City with the ability to
register lobbyists, create rules for lobbyist's conduct in their interactions with
elected officials and public servants, and the ability to enforce those rules;
6. On February 21, 2017, the previous Council unanimously adopted a motion that
was then submitted as a resolution to the 2017 Union of BC Municipalities
convention asking the Province to provide municipalities with the ability to
register lobbyists, create rules for lobbyists’ conduct in their interactions with
elected officials and public servants, and the ability to enforce those rules;
7. The City’s resolution was successfully adopted by Union of BC Municipalities
delegates in September 2017 and forwarded to the Province for response; and
8. The most recent response by the Province in February 2018 to the 2017 UBCM
resolution affirmed the Province is willing to discuss the matter further.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT the City of Vancouver request the Province
immediately take one of the following two actions in response to the resolutions adopted
by the previous Council and Union of BC Municipalities in 2017 regarding the regulation
of municipal lobbyists:
i) The Province amend the Lobbyist Registration Act to cover the City of
Vancouver and administer the regulation of lobbying in the City; OR,
ii) The Province amend the Vancouver Charter to allow the City to establish
a lobbyist registry and give the City the legal authority to register
lobbyists, create rules for lobbyists’ conduct in their interactions with
elected officials and public servants, as well as the power to enforce
those rules. In addition, the Province further empower the Provincial
Registrar of Lobbyists to work with the City to share information so as to
reduce duplication and costs for both levels of government.

city of Vancouver;
2. In 2018, the Provincial Government released “Childcare B.C., Caring for Kids,
Lifting up Families: The Path to Universal Childcare”. The document states
“Vancouver is one of the most expensive cities for Childcare with a median fee of
$1,250 per month for infant and toddler care”. The document also commits to
providing grants to local governments in British Columbia to support building new
child care spaces and creating plans to inform local needs;
3. On June 26, 2018, The City of Vancouver issued a press release celebrating
1064 new child care spaces. On the City of Vancouver website, Mayor Gregor
Robertson is stated as saying “Making sure that families have access to
affordable childcare is a key part of building a healthy, inclusive city and helps set
our kids up for success now and down the road”;
4. The City of Vancouver Document “Technical Guidelines” published by Real
Estate and Facilities Management in May of 2018 states that “Development
Permits may be required for new childcare facilities. Building and Occupancy
Permits are required for all new childcare facilities;
5. A Child Care Facility’s childcare license will need to be obtained by the Childcare
Operator from Community Care Facilities Licensing, a department of Vancouver
Coastal Health, before an Occupancy Permit can be obtained. Nowhere in the
document does it state that there is a policy to streamline and expedite the
processes associated with permits and licensing for new childcare facilities;
6. The City of Vancouver Document “Steps for Establishing a Child Care Centre in
an Existing Building”, published by the Social Development Department was last
updated in 2008;
7. The City of Vancouver website page “Developing a childcare centre” states “Staff
work with developers, architects, landscape architects, and early childhood
educators to make sure that every new center includes urban design best
practices, and contributes to a child’s mental and physical development”. There
is no mention of incentives or expediting the processes for childcare facilities in
Vancouver;
8. On September 19, 2018, the motion entitled “Family Friendly Vancouver:
Citywide Policy to Fast Track and Expedite Projects that include new Child Care
Centres in the City of Vancouver” was referred to staff. It is anticipated that staff
will report back to Council in June 2019;
9. On September 2018, the British Columbia Ministry of Children and Family
Development issued a press release titled “Partnerships give B.C. families
quicker access to child care”. The release states “Municipal and regional
government in B.C. are eligible for up to $1 million per project through the new
Community Child Care Space Creation Program. Priority will be given to projects

Minutes, Wednesday, December 5 and 12, 2018 17
that build spaces that serve infants and toddlers, offer care outside of regular
business hours, are operated by a public body or non-profit, and/or benefit
underserved populations”; and
10. Phase 1 Actions of the Women’s Equity Strategy include “Identify child-friendly
provisions to accommodate participation by families with children at Council and
public hearings at City Hall.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to formally contact the appropriate Ministry of Children
and Family Development staff to discuss opportunities for the City of Vancouver
to secure funding for future projects from the Community Child Care Space
Creation Program and report back to Council within the potential for provincial
funding.
B. THAT Council direct staff to explore ways the City of Vancouver can work with
organizations and agencies including Vancouver Coastal Health and the B.C.
government to streamline and expedite the processes associated with permits
and licensing for child care facilities in Vancouver.
C. THAT Council direct staff to explore a program to create incentives for applicants
to include child care in future developments and report back to Council in Spring
of 2019; however, if funding from senior levels of government becomes available
sooner, that staff prioritize and expedite a report and any recommendations to
Council.
D. THAT Council direct staff to consider purpose-built child care, including
temporary structures similar to modular housing when appropriate;
FURTHER THAT staff consider requirements for child care facilities to be
included; when appropriate, on any development of City-owned Land.

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, December 5 and 12, 2018 19
On December 12, 2018, the Committee considered the motion “Land Value Capture in the City
of Vancouver”.
MOVED by Councillor Boyle
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. Land speculation has had a significant impact on increasing land values within
Vancouver, deepening the city’s affordability crisis and putting a significant
portion of housing out of reach at local incomes;
2. Rezoning, density increases and redevelopment also have a significant impact
on increasing land values, including all the surrounding land immediately in the
proximity of developed land;
3. Infrastructure projects in Vancouver, such as hospitals, new roads, new transit,
parks, or other development decisions approved by the City, there is a dramatic
increase in the value of surrounding land. That wealth is not captured but rather
becomes a transfer of wealth from the public to private landowners;
4. The increase in land value due to market demand is not captured by anyone
except the property owner, who may withhold development awaiting land value
lift or rezoning, then capture the majority of the wealth with limited social benefit;
5. Vancouver is now one of the most expensive cities in the Western hemisphere,
with a lack of available affordable housing, and a lack of sufficient financial tools
for ensuring new housing is truly affordable for low and modest incomes;
6. Over the past 20-plus years, municipalities have experienced cost downloading
from senior levels of government, including housing and social infrastructure,
without new municipal finance tools or revenue to fund those costs;
7. A Land Value Capture (LVC) mechanism is designed to dampen speculation and
generate revenue by measuring and ‘capturing’ a portion of the increase in land
value (created by rezoning, public investments, etc) to direct toward public
priorities;
8. LVC has the potential to be a more transparent method of capturing land value
than Vancouver’s existing CAC system, and more accurate than Development
Contribution Expectations (DCEs). Applied broadly, it decreases rampant land
speculation and unfettered value increases, thus ensuring long term affordability;
9. The creation of a City Wide plan creates a timely opportunity to be exploring and
implementing a municipally controlled financial mechanism such as a LVC; and
10. Some form of LVC is in use in about 25 countries around the world, including
South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. A few jurisdictions in the U.S., mostly
in Pennsylvania, also use a blended version that is partly a land value tax and

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, December 5 and 12, 2018 20
partly a buildings tax.1 And Vancouver had a Land Value Tax from 1910 to
1984.2
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to work with policy makers, researchers, and BC
Assessment to explore how Council could create, adopt and consistently apply a
land value capture mechanism to collect a percentage of the wealth being
created by public decision makers in the City of Vancouver. This would include:
i. Exploring how a LVC could work within, or replace, Vancouver’s existing
system of Community Amenities Contributions (CACs) and Development
Contribution Expectations (DCEs) to reduce backlog in approval, and
fairly capture the value of wealth created by land rezoning and public
infrastructure projects;
ii. Determining the most appropriate time to set the baseline value and at
which point during sale or redevelopment to capture the new value;
iii. Considering other factors including: the ideal percentage of value to
capture, the impact on various property classifications, the potential
revenue that would be generated, the impact on development, and the
potential scope of the policy; and
vi. Outlining next steps for the City of Vancouver to work with the Province to
develop a ‘made-in-Vancouver’ land value capture, and next steps for
working with TransLink to model a land value capture mechanism for
transit infrastructure investments, including partially funding an extension
of the Broadway subway to UBC;
vii. Articulating clear jurisdictional expectations that ensure such a tool would
remain within the control of the City, with revenue to go toward local
priorities (including truly-affordable housing).
B. THAT Council direct staff to report back to Council by May 2019 with their initial
findings and recommendations.

MOVED by Councillor Swanson
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. The City of Vancouver’s website states that: “Poverty is a barrier to prosperity,
not an alternative to it”;
2. Vancouver has the second highest gap in income between rich and poor of
Canadian cities5, vast visible poverty in the Downtown Eastside, and more than
10% of the working-age population are people who are working poor6. Poverty
disproportionately affects certain communities in Vancouver, often as the result
of historical dispossession, systemic racism and inequality;
5 “Prosperity for all through a Healthy Communities Approach: Vancouver’s Recommendations to the
Federal Government’s National Poverty Reduction Strategy, July 2017.” p 3.
6 Source: statistics Canada, 2012. Cited in www.policyalternatives.ca/van-working-poverty

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, December 5 and 12, 2018 29
3. Median personal income in Vancouver is 8 per cent lower than for Canada
overall, despite its escalating cost of living. 44% of people in Vancouver, more
than 250,000 people, live in families with incomes less than the living wage;
4. Many impacts of poverty are experienced at the local level, and local residents
pay for poverty in increased health care costs, higher crime, higher demand for
community, social and charitable services, lack of school readiness, reduced
school success, and lower economic productivity;
5. The poorest people in Vancouver are those on welfare or unable to get on
welfare. There is an insufficient number of social housing and shelter-rate units to
meet the growing need. Vancouver is seeing increasing numbers of homeless
people, with a very low vacancy rate, and welfare rates that do not provide
enough money to cover food and shelter. As a result, the city spends millions of
dollars trying to help people who are homeless and mitigate against the worst
impacts of the housing crisis on our most vulnerable residents;
6. A long overdue increase in income and disability assistance rates, targeted
measures to address the number of women and child living in poverty, rent
control (including vacancy control), and legislated targets and timelines, would
help ensure that government money spent to reduce poverty would benefit those
most marginalized;
7. A poverty reduction plan will save lives and money as it is a social and economic
investment in our province;
8. The BC Poverty Reduction Coalition is a broad-based network of over 400
organizations including community and non profit groups, faith groups, health
organizations, indigenous organizations, businesses, labour organizations, and
social policy groups; and ‐
9. The Coalition has renewed its call for a strong poverty reduction plan for British
Columbia by launching the ABC Plan, which outlines an accountable, bold and
comprehensive poverty reduction plan to prevent and reduce poverty in British
Columbia.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council support the BC Poverty Reduction Coalition’s ABC Plan for an
accountable, bold and comprehensive poverty reduction plan for British Columbia
as set out on the BC Poverty Reduction Coalition website:
https://www.abcplan.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Policy-Brief.pdf.
B. THAT Council advocate to the Provincial Government to develop and implement
a provincial poverty reduction strategy that includes the measures within the
Accountable, Bold and Comprehensive Poverty Reduction Plan for British
Columbia before February 2019, with the commitment that Council will work with
the Provincial Government in implementing this plan.

MOVED by Councillor Bligh
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
1. Property taxes are the main source of tax revenue for the City of Vancouver and
other British Columbia municipalities;
2. In addition to municipal property taxes, the City of Vancouver also collects school
taxes on behalf of the Province and remits these revenues to the Province;
3. Starting in 2019, the Province of British Columbia plans to apply a controversial
surcharge on the provincial school tax, the proceeds of which will flow to the
Province’s general tax revenues;

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, December 5 and 12, 2018 31
4. The Province’s surcharge on school taxes will apply to most “high-valued
residential properties in the province”, specifically those assessed at $3 million or
more;
5. The Province’s school tax surtax rate will be an additional 0.2 percent on the
residential portion of properties assessed between $3 million and $4 million
(i.e., an additional $2,000 surtax), and 0.4 percent on the residential portion of
properties assessed over $4 million (i.e., an additional $4,000 surtax per million
of assessed value);
6. Unlike the provincial school tax, and municipal property taxes, the Province’s
new surtax is not based on an equitable mill rate – it is based on a straight
percentage of assessed value and assumed wealth, and it sets a controversial
precedent;
7. There is an inequitable collection of the tax from those municipalities that have a
higher distribution of homes valued over $3 million, including the City of
Vancouver; and
8. The Province’s surcharge on the provincial school tax represents an
encroachment on the City of Vancouver’s municipal tax base. Residents could
perceive the increase on their property tax bill is a result of municipal financial
mismanagement and thus could ‘revolt’ against City of Vancouver property tax
increases.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
THAT the Mayor of Vancouver on behalf of City Council send a letter to the
Premier, BC Minister of Finance, Leader of the Opposition and Leader of the BC
Green Party requesting that the Province withdraw the proposed surcharge on
the provincial school tax and recommend that the Province use other tax-
generating options available to the Province, such as the progressive income tax
system, to fund the BC budget;
FURTHER THAT it be noted in the letter to the BC Minister of Finance that the
Province’s progressive income tax base could more equitably generate the $250
million in revenue that the surtax is expected to raise toward the provincial
budget – e.g., a 0.25-per-cent increase applied to the top income tax bracket
would mean that a taxpayer with a net income of less than $150,000 per year
would pay no additional income tax while someone earning a net income of
$250,000 per year would only pay $250 in additional income tax.

budget; and” be deleted from the first part of the resolution;

FINAL MOTION AS AMENDED
1. Property taxes are the main source of tax revenue for the City of Vancouver and
other British Columbia municipalities;
2. In addition to municipal property taxes, the City of Vancouver also collects school
taxes on behalf of the Province and remits these revenues to the Province;
3. Starting in 2019, the Province of British Columbia plans to apply a controversial
surcharge on the provincial school tax, the proceeds of which will flow to the
Province’s general tax revenues;
https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/taxes/property-taxes/annual-property-
tax/school-tax
4. The Province’s surcharge on school taxes will apply to most “high-valued
residential properties in the province”, specifically those assessed at $3 million or
more;
5. The Province’s school tax surtax rate will be an additional 0.2 percent on the
residential portion of properties assessed between $3 million and $4 million
(i.e., an additional $2,000 surtax), and 0.4 percent on the residential portion of
properties assessed over $4 million (i.e., an additional $4,000 surtax per million
of assessed value);
6. Unlike the provincial school tax, and municipal property taxes, the Province’s
new surtax is not based on an equitable mill rate – it is based on a straight

mismanagement and thus could ‘revolt’ against City of Vancouver property tax
increases.

THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
THAT the Mayor of Vancouver on behalf of City Council send a letter to the

WHEREAS
1. The City of Vancouver 2018 Operating Budget allocated $3.050 million to the
direct operational costs of the Mayor and Council, with 43 percent
(i.e., $1.312 million) of that amount allocated to the Mayor and the remaining
57 percent (i.e., $1.738) million allocated to the activities of the 10 other
members of Council;
2. The City of Vancouver’s 2016 Statement of Financial Information indicates that
the Mayor’s Office discretionary expenses for 2016 totalled $783,090 while the
discretionary expenses for all City Councillors totalled $14,517 – collectively less
than 2 percent of the Mayor’s expenditures;
3. The City of Vancouver’s 2017 Statement of Financial Information indicates that
the Mayor’s Office discretionary expenses for 2017 totalled $706,165 while the
discretionary expenses for all City Councillors totalled $20,880 – collectively less
than 3 percent of the Mayor’s expenditures;
4. During the previous Council term from 2014 to 2018, the Mayor’s office budget
and discretionary expense fund were the subject of considerable scrutiny,
notably substantial expenditures on political staff and consultants;

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, December 5 and 12, 2018 34
5. In April 2016, Council enacted By-law 11483 (Mayor and Council Remuneration
By-law) and By-law 11620 (minor amendment to 11483) to replace By-law 7465
and provide for updated base salaries for Deputy Mayor, Acting Mayor and
Councillors, as well as to provide for annual adjustments to Mayor and
Councillors’ salaries based on the change in the Consumer Price Index for
Vancouver (all items) for the 12 months ending October the previous year;
6. In June 2016, By-law 11529 (Mayor and Council Expense By-law) was enacted
to replace By-law 8904 and established the annual discretionary fund for each
Councillor to cover eligible expenses incurred while carrying out constituency
activities;
7. By-law 11529 (Mayor and Council Expense By-law) included housekeeping
amendments to provide clarifications for various eligible expenses, including the
Mayor’s discretionary fund which includes expenses incurred by the Mayor or his
staff for meetings and conferences, travel, communications, consulting/
contracting services, research/information gathering, and community outreach;
8. Prior to the enactment of By-laws 11483 and 11529, the City of Vancouver 2015
Operating Budget included a substantial 23.6% increase to the Mayor’s budget –
a $0.2 million increase to support the Mayor's role as Chair of TransLink Mayors'
Council, the Big City Mayors' Caucus, Vancouver Police Board, and Vancouver
Economic Commission; https://vancouver.ca/files/cov/vancouver-2015-

9. The recent municipal elections in Metro Vancouver have resulted in changes to
the makeup of the TransLink Mayors’ Council and will potentially lead to changed
roles on other bodies such as the Big City Mayors’ Caucus; and
10. Newly-elected Vancouver Mayor Kennedy Stewart has demonstrated his
commitment to a different approach to governing, for example, restoring the
traditional rotation of the Deputy Mayor duties, as well as appointing Councillors
to various boards and committees on a non-partisan basis.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Vancouver City Council direct the 2019 Budget Committee to review the
