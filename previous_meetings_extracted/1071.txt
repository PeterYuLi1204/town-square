traffic and create a Permanent Public Plaza;
2. January 22, 2018, the Vancouver Police Department arrested four individuals
and recommended charges for a fifth individual, who were vending marijuana on
City of Vancouver property;

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, Tuesday, March 13, 2018 13
3. Metro News published an article on January 23, 2018, titled “Despite arrests,
Robson Square marijuana sellers say they won't stop.” The article states “Over
a two-month operation, police found evidence that the vendors had sold
marijuana to minors and that harder drugs such as cocaine had also been
offered to customers to purchase.”
4. A Vancouver Police Department Media Release issued on January 23, 2018,
stated “Our response has been incremental. However, at each stage, the
vendors have refused to co-operate, and concerns around public safety have
increased. As such, we have had to escalate our response.” The release went
on to outline “Vancouver Police have seized:
 more than nine pounds in dried bulk marijuana;
 more than $4,000 in cash;
 23 pounds of edible marijuana products, including gummies, lollipops, baked
goods, and liquid oils;
 a bat, pipe, and baton;
 used drug paraphernalia, including scales, bongs, and grinders; and
 six tents and ten tables”;
5. On the City of Vancouver website under news, a page published
April 13, 2016, states that “Improvements to Robson Plaza will enable residents
and visitors to socialize, engage, and display civil democracy and creative
expression.”;
6. Prior to the Vancouver Police Department arrests in Robson Plaza for illegal
Marijuana vending, City of Vancouver Staff and the Vancouver Police
Department spent weeks trying to compel illegal marijuana vendors to leave
the area;
7. The City of Vancouver staff report dated April 11, 2016, suggests that closing
800 Robson Street permanently requires rerouting the East/West #5
Robson/Downtown Bus and “provides a less direct connection from the West
End to some key destinations on Granville Street.”;
8. The permanent closure of 800 Robson Street was mandated to provide a free
and all ages public space for the public to enjoy;
9. Council has received correspondence outlining complaints regarding the illegal
activities that make some people feel uncomfortable and unwelcome.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to move forward with plans to reopen Robson Plaza for
cyclists and buses within 60 days and report back to Council at the
March 14, 2018, City Finances and Services Committee Meeting.
B. THAT Council direct staff to consider options for opening the road to motorized
vehicles in the future.
