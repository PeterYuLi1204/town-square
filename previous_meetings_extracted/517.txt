2. Asking for a Change to the Vancouver Charter to Allow the City to Levy a
Progressive Property Tax
MOVED by Councillor Swanson
SECONDED by Councillor Boyle
WHEREAS
1. A progressive tax imposes a lower tax rate on people who are less able to pay
and a higher rate on those who are most able to pay;
2. British Columbia’s provincial income tax is progressive: designated by income
those with a higher income;
3. Canada’s federal income tax is progressive, as it is determined by income
bracket, with lower income-earners paying a smaller percentage of their earnings
than higher income earners;
4. British Columbia introduced an additional school tax in 2018 that is a progressive
property tax. Properties valued under $3 million do not pay this tax; valuations

Council Meeting
Minutes, April 12, 2022 24
between $3 million and $4 million pay 0.2% tax and those valued at $4 million
and above pay a 0.4% tax;
5. Vancouver’s city property tax is currently regressive, as it imposes the same rate
on all properties regardless of the assessed value;
6. Vancouver needs a fair way to raise additional funds that does not put an undue
burden on most people but can raise the money from those with enough wealth
to be able to pay for needed public services, combat climate change, reduce
homelessness, support affordable housing;
7. A recent staff report to Vancouver City Council itemized over $200M in costs
downloaded on the city by provincial and federal governments
https://vancouver.ca/files/cov/12-03-2021-council-memo-city-funds-allocated-to-
downloaded-services.pdf;
8. The 2016 Statistics Canada Financial Security Survey shows that share of land
wealth and total net worth in BC increase together, with the richest households
holding by far the most land wealth and the poorest households holding the least.
Progressive property taxation, rather than a flat rate taxation, would reduce
wealth inequality https://www.policynote.ca/land-wealth-is-a-massive-source-of-
inequality-in-bc/;
9. A provincial program provides a low income grant supplement for senior home
owners earning less than $32,000 a year
https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/taxes/property-taxes/annual-property-
tax/home-owner-grant/senior/low-income;
10. BC homeowners who are 55 years or older, a surviving spouse, or eligible
persons with disabilities can also apply to defer their property taxes. Deferment is
also available for homeowners who financially support a dependent child.
https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2018FIN0023-000951;
11. Extra money from a progressive tax could be used to build housing and reduce
homelessness; and
12. For example, if there were an additional surtax of 1% on the value of residential
properties assessed at over $5 million and 2% on the value over $10 million, the
City could have collected approximately $225,000,000 from 4,806 properties in
2021; Modular housing costs approximately $300,000-$500,000 per 320 square
foot unit which would mean 450-750 new homes could be built per year.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council request the Mayor, on behalf of City Council, to urge the Province
to amend the Vancouver Charter to permit Council to impose different rates of
property tax based on the value of the property.

Council Meeting
Minutes, April 12, 2022 25
B. THAT Council direct staff to investigate options for the legal and financial
structure of a Vancouver progressive property tax and how it could help to end
homelessness, and report back by Q4 2022.

The motion, having not received a seconder, was not put.
5. Lock It or Lose It: Improving Secure Bike Infrastructure in the City of Vancouver
MOVED by Councillor Fry
SECONDED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
WHEREAS
1. Cycling can be an inexpensive, healthy and convenient form of transportation;
2. Vancouver is a cycling city with 10% of trips to work or school and 6% of
shopping trips made by bicycle.1 With a BikeScore of 79, and a network of slowed
street and separated cycling routes, Vancouver is referred to as the second most
bike friendly city in Canada;
3. As part of Vancouver’s Climate Emergency Action Plan, the city has target of 2/3
of all trips by walk/bike/transit by 2030;
4. Safe and secure end-of-trip cycling infrastructure like bike racks, storage lockers,
and bike parking encourage and facilitate more trips by bike;
5. Vancouver has the most bike thefts per capita of any Canadian City. In 2020,
2,115 bicycles were stolen, although police say more thefts were never reported;2
The Vancouver Police Department’s anti-theft and bike identification and

Council Meeting
Minutes, April 12, 2022 26
registration program 529 Garage3 advises target hardening through secure locks
and locations to make bike theft more difficult: “Your bike is only as secure as
what you’re locking it to. Make sure thieves can’t lift your bike over the object or
detach the object from the ground to take your bike. Shake the object first to
check it's bolted or cemented. Avoid locking your bike to handrails or other
mobility aids”;
6. According to the City’s current Open Data stats (currently out of date and under
review) there are approximately only 2,422 public bike racks variously installed
on City property, and including street use permit locations issued to commercial
tenants, Business Improvement Associations (BIA), building owners and
development companies, etc.;
7. The deficit of secure bike parking represents a barrier to making trips by bike and
a hardship for anyone who has had their bicycle stolen or stripped;
In a 2009 report4, the Vancouver Public Space Network warned that there is not
enough bicycle parking to meet current demand. The report further highlighted a
lack of space in existing racks or distance of racks from cyclists’ destinations as
barriers to increasing trips by bike. The report further notes:
a. Lack of infrastructure also results in increased bicycle theft, presents
hazards to pedestrians, and damages city property;
b. Existing bicycle parking infrastructure is inadequate in terms of design,
placement, and maintenance; and
c. Parking Meters are likely to be phased out in the City, further reducing the
number of secure locations for bicycle parking in commercial areas;
8. Parking meters have served as ubiquitous and useful ad hoc cycling
infrastructure in the form of a durable street furniture that is usually well located
and in clear view of shopping and community destinations high traffic commercial
districts and businesses. However:
a. With the 2021 approved replacement of parking meters with digital
parking stations, approximately 5,500 parking meters city-wide are
scheduled to be removed by end of 2023. This means the loss of
hundreds of secure bike lockups to Vancouverites who chose to shop,
work, and play in our city by bike;
b. The city anticipates retrofitting only 2,000 of the parking meter posts with
ring racks over the next three years;
c. The old meterheads and posts have no use beyond bike parking. Their
parts are recycled or donated to other municipalities;5
d. By design, the replacement of parking meters with connected pay stations
anticipates an increase in generation of street parking revenue; and

Council Meeting
Minutes, April 12, 2022 27
e. The actual and projected removal of parking meters represents a
significant loss of necessary bike parking infrastructure;
9. The City of Vancouver lacks a comprehensive bike rack strategy that identifies
quantities, locations, convenience, safety, best practices, and design guidelines
for installing secure bike locking infrastructure. As per the Transportation
Demand Management Action Plan for 2021-2025, a bicycle parking strategy will
not be completed until the end of 2023;6 and
10. The lack of and ongoing loss of secure locking infrastructure for cyclists
compromises the City’s ability to meet goals of encouraging more Vancouverites
to make more trips by bike.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council affirms that secure end-of-trip bike locking infrastructure are
essential to meeting City of Vancouver goals pertaining to active transportation
and Climate Action; and without intervention, the City will experience a net loss of
secure end-of-trip bike locking infrastructure with the planned removal of parking
meters city-wide.
B. THAT Council direct staff to prepare an inventory of current public locking
infrastructure, and needs to meet projected demands of our 2030 CEAP goals;
FURTHER THAT the inventory includes existing and at-risk ad-hoc public bike
locking infrastructure like parking meters, and this information is reported back to
Council as soon as possible before the scheduled removal of city-wide parking
meters.
C. THAT Council direct staff to expedite a secure bike parking strategy that includes
best practices that considers:
a. Safety and pedestrian comfort;
b. Locations relative to destinations;
c. Locations relative to major transit infrastructure and stations;
d. Locations based on needs and frequency of shopping and activities;
e. Locations that promote ease of use and shelter from elements;
f. Security from theft, target hardening, and crime prevention through

6. Free Parking and Other Measures to Address Public Safety and the Revitalization
of Chinatown
MOVED by Councillor De Genova
SECONDED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
WHEREAS
1. In 2017, the City of Vancouver began formal work to pursue UNESCO World
Heritage Site status for Chinatown;
2. In 2017, in the interest of revitalizing Chinatown, the City of Vancouver
established a Chinatown Legacy Stewardship Group, comprised of community
representatives and stakeholders;
3. In February 2021, the Vancouver Police Department (VPD) reported Anti-Asian
hate crimes had increased 717%;
4. On May 7, 2021, Bloomberg Equality + Businessweek published an article titled
“This is the Anti-Asian Hate Crime Capital of North America”, citing the rise in
Anti-Asian Racism and violence in Vancouver;
5. Business Owners, stakeholders and organizations have identified a lack of free
parking in Vancouver’s Chinatown as a barrier to economic prosperity and
attracting customers;
6. The City of Richmond or private parking lots provide free vehicle parking for
customers while shopping. This has created competition for merchants in
Chinatown Vancouver;
7. Glass windows and doors on storefronts and buildings are broken regularly in
Chinatown. Treasured historical sites, including Dr. Sun Yat-Sen Classical
Chinese Garden, have been defaced with graffiti; and
8. Murals, artwork and public art have been defaced with graffiti, including
messages of hate and Anti-Asian slurs.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to prepare amendments to by-laws to update Parking
Meter By-law No. 2952 by May 2022 to allow up to 3 hours of free parking at
meters on Sundays in Chinatown;
FURTHER THAT Council direct staff to prepare amendments to necessary by-
laws to allow 3 hours of free parking for vehicles at City of Vancouver-owned
parking lots on Sundays in Chinatown;

7. Supporting the Innovation Economy
MOVED by Councillor Wiebe
SECONDED by Councillor Carr
WHEREAS
1. Vancouver is recognized as a global hub for innovation, in particular in the
sectors of cleantech, visual effects, virtual reality, biotech, augmented reality,
Web3, blockchain, NFT technology, video gaming, Cloud as a Service, and
applied artificial intelligence. Vancouver has been recently acknowledged as the
second fastest growing innovation hub in North America according to CBRE. An
unprecedented 14 unicorns (private companies valued over $1B) have been
based in Vancouver over the past 2 years. These unicorns include Trulioo
($2.1B), Clio ($2B), Dapper Labs ($7.6B), GeoComply ($1B), among others.
Here is a report on Six Stories In 2021 That Demonstrated Vancouver’s Web3
Emergence;
2. Vancouver is host to innovation forums, hubs and coalitions, many of which the
Vancouver Economic Commission (VEC) is active participants and/or partners
with including:
a. Metro Vancouver Zero Emissions Innovation Centre – the Vancouver
chapter of the Low Carbon Cities Canada initiative, which now includes
ZEBx
b. BC’s Centre for Innovation and Clean Energy – supports scaling clean
energy solutions
c. Vancouver Maritime Centre for Climate – supports decarbonizing
maritime shipping and marine vessels
d. SMART Biofuels consortium at UBC – supports decarbonizing long haul
transportation (aviation, trucking, rail & maritime)
e. Foresight Canada – seeks to be a cleantech accelerator
f. Share Reuse Repair Initiative – supports the transition to a Circular
Economy
g. Circular Food innovation Lab - supports solutions to eliminate avoidable
food waste across Vancouver’s food supply chain
h. Frontier Collective - supports early stage infrastructure, economic
development and investment attraction;

Council Meeting
Minutes, April 12, 2022 32
3. The VEC has two signature programs focused on growing the local cleantech
and sustainable innovation business community:
a. Project Greenlight
i. Supports innovators to gain access to municipal and institutional
assets and infrastructure to demonstrate or pilot test their
sustainability-related solutions i.e. cleantech, clean energy, “smart-
city” and other more;
ii. Helps innovators commercialize their green solutions faster, and get
critical market feedback from member-institutions (e.g. City of
Vancouver, Translink, Fortis, etc.) who in turn can better understand
solutions to help address climate change;
b. The Angels for Climate Solutions Program
i. The innovation necessary to meet our climate goals;
ii. Accepted 20 climate-tech start-ups from a pool of 56 applicants, and
21 angel investors, 9 of whom were accredited and 12 non-accredited
with an equity pool of $122,000; and
iii. One of the largest innovation-centered collaborations in our
ecosystem, achieving a near 50% representation of visible minorities
in both investor and start-up cohorts.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct the Vancouver Economic
Commission (VEC) to provide a high level overview and profile to Council of the
local innovation ecosystem, including examples of key innovation organizations,
number of jobs, capital investment (subject to available data), key strengths,
issues and opportunities for local innovation sectors, and examples of how local
innovation can further climate action, equity and diversity priorities;
FURTHER THAT the staff at VEC host a roundtable with key leaders in the local
innovation ecosystem to gather further industry input.

8. Enabling a Recovery Community Centre in the City of Vancouver
MOVED by Councillor Bligh
SECONDED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
WHEREAS
1. On April 14, 2016, then Provincial Health Officer, Dr. Perry Kendall, declared a
public health emergency under the Public Health Act due to the significant rise in
opioid-related overdose deaths reported in B.C.;
2. The City of Vancouver has likewise signalled a state of emergency with respect
to the unregulated, contaminated drug supply and the associated opioid-related
overdose deaths. In July 2019, Vancouver City Council approved the Safe
Supply Statement, created in collaboration with the Vancouver Community Action
Team, whereby the City will share with other government partners, including the
Government of Canada, and advocate for access to a safe, regulated drug
supply;
3. Under the Public Health Act, real-time information can be collected, reported, and
analyzed across the health system in a public health emergency, to immediately
identify where risks are arising and to take proactive action to warn and protect
people who use drugs;
4. Almost 7,000 British Columbians have died from the Province’s poisoned,
unregulated drug supply since the overdose public health emergency was
declared on April 14, 2016. Moreover, subsequent to the declaration of the
COVID-19 public health emergency on March 17, 2020, the rate of overdose
events and illicit drug toxicity deaths have increased and surpassed historic
highs;
5. In May 2017, the Federation of Canadian Municipalities’ (FCM) Big-City Mayors’
Caucus launched a Task Force on the Opioid Crisis to share best practices and
save lives. The Task Force put forward a series of comprehensive
recommendations to the federal government for a coordinated, nation-wide
action by all orders of government, including action on all four pillars of Canada’s
drug strategy: i.e., harm reduction, treatment, prevention, and enforcement;
6. Among the recommendations of the FCM Mayors’ Task Force on the Opioid
Crisis, the recommendations related to treatment include a recommendation for
zero delays for getting into comprehensive treatment programs;
7. 2021 was the deadliest year for illicit-drug overdoses in B.C., with the highest
ever number of deaths in a single month recorded in the month of October (201
deaths) and 1,782 deaths in the first ten months of 2021, surpassing the 1,765
deaths recorded in all of 2020;
8. It is abundantly clear that urgent action continues to be required on multiple
levels to prevent further deaths from overdoses and the poisoned drug supply.
This urgent action includes advocating for a safe supply: But it also calls for
stronger and more effective supports for people seeking treatment or recovery

Council Meeting
Minutes, April 12, 2022 34
options specific to their chosen path to wellness, including supports for those
persons who choose harm reduction or who are not ready to make the recovery
step;
9. There are many known gaps in the system when it comes to treatment options,
and people who are ready for recovery typically face barriers to accessing the
right treatment option at the right moment in time. Treatment options are not
always available in-the-moment when a person is ready to pursue recovery, and
this often leads to relapses, additional overdoses and deaths, and a missed
opportunity;
10. Among the most persistent treatment gap is the gap between the moment in time
that a person is ready to enter into recovery and the corresponding availability of
an appropriate treatment path for them to access. Experts point to this gap as
perhaps the most crucial gap in the system that needs to be addressed in order
for more people to find their path to recovery in ways that reflect autonomy,
choice, and real time response;
11. The Recovery Coach model has demonstrated enormous potential to
successfully fill the gap between the time that a person is ready to enter into
recovery and the time that the most effective treatment path and option is
available for them to pursue. This gap period is frequently cited as the stumbling
block to successful recovery. This includes those whose path the recovery
includes access to a safe supply;
12. The Recovery Coach model is based on trained paraprofessionals who use
theoretically sound, evidence-based knowledge and skills to empower people
with substance use or addiction issues to enable them to overcome barriers and
build “recovery capital” to enter recovery and progress along their chosen
journeys. Recovery Coaches bridge gaps in the system, connecting people to the
types of treatment and support they need, and linking them with resources and
recovery support networks in their communities;
13. The Recovery Coach model has great potential for our city in the face of the
overdose crisis and poisoned drug supply, and Vancouver Coastal Health has
identified the need for a non-medicalized Recovery Community Center that can
offer people in-the-moment access to recovery coaches and help-centered
approaches; and
14. The City of Vancouver has infrastructure resources and jurisdictional powers
such as zoning, as well as access to City-owned sites and buildings, and the
ability to expedite and otherwise enable facility improvements and permitting that
could serve to support the prompt establishment of a Recovery Community
Center in the city. It is therefore incumbent upon the City and City Council to
make these resources available and to use these jurisdictional powers to prevent
overdose and opioid-related deaths and better support individual paths to
recovery.

Council Meeting
Minutes, April 12, 2022 35
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council endorse the need to establish a Recovery Community Centre
space in the city and thereby direct staff to work with Vancouver Coastal Health
and other relevant partners to enable the rapid establishment of a Recovery
Community Centre in the city in as timely a manner as possible given the dire,
life-critical nature of the public health emergency faced by our city and its people;
FURTHER THAT Council specifically direct and empower the City’s
Development, Buildings, and Licensing staff, Real Estate and Facilities
Management Services staff, and the City’s Arts, Culture, and Community
Services staff to work in close coordination to identify and facilitate any zoning
and/or related permitting requirements and/or adjustments that may be required,
as well as any necessary site improvements requiring consideration, on an
expedited basis to achieve the rapid establishment of a Recovery Community
Center in the city, including explorations of the potential use and/or access to
appropriate City-owned sites.
B. THAT, pursuant to the direction to staff in clause “A” above – staff shall advise
Council of any actions required on the part of Council that may be necessary to
accomplish the Recovery Community Center objectives noted in clause “A”
above.
C. THAT Council direct staff to report back with recommendations for policies,
protocols, and procedures by the start of Q4 that would assign the highest priority
to, and otherwise expedite, permit applications and approval processes that
specifically relate to life-critical facilities and/or amenities that respond to the
overdose crisis and related actions, with the aim being to ensure that the
establishment of facilities and/or amenities of this nature are not delayed or
otherwise bottlenecked behind by applications and/or approval processes that do
not, by their inherent nature, respond directly to the life-critical needs of the
overdose crisis.
