1. Regulation Redesign - Amendments to Zoning & Development and Parking By-laws
An application by General Manager of Planning, Urban Design and Sustainability was considered as
follows:
Summary: To amend the Zoning and Development By-law and several Official
Development Plans to update and simplify the City’s land use regulations and
related land use documents, and to make them more user-friendly. In
combination with permit processing improvements, these amendments will

Public Hearing
Minutes, June 25 and 30, 2020 2
help to simplify, clarify, and streamline permit review. Various housekeeping
amendments are also proposed for the Parking By-law.
The General Manager of Planning, Urban Design and Sustainability recommended approval.
Council also had before it a Memorandum dated June 15, 2020, entitled “Regulation Redesign –
Amendments to the Zoning and Development and Parking By-laws - RTS-13686”, from Chris
Robertson, Assistant Director, City-Wide and Regional Planning, Planning, Urban Design and
Sustainability, which informed Council of changes to the draft amendments to the Zoning and
Development By-law and the Southeast Granville Slopes Official Development Plan for the report
noted above to address errors and omissions. The draft amendments had been revised to:
a) correct section 5.2.1 to remove the following clause: “Unless otherwise approved, refused or
subject to limitations in time as may be imposed by the Director of Planning or the
Development Permit Board, any development permit application shall be void 12 months from
the date of application.”, which was erroneously inserted (it is section 4.2.1). It is replaced
with the correct clause: “The Director of Planning may vary the provisions of this By-law
relating to any of the following:”;
b) correct a reference in section 4.4.3 of the RM-9, RM-9A, RM-9N, RM-9AN and RM-9BN
Districts Schedule. Section 4.4.3 incorrectly references section 4.7.13 (i) of the schedule. The
correct reference is section 4.7.15 (j);
c) insert the wording shown in italics, which was inadvertently excluded from the clauses shown
below, for the following districts:
a. in 4.7.4 (f) of the First Shaughnessy District Schedule, “entries, porches, verandahs,
or covered porches above the first storey”;
b. in 4.7.3 (f)(i) of the RT-10 and RT-10N Districts Schedule, “the side facing the street or
rear property line or common open space is open or protected by guards that do not
exceed the required minimum height,”;
c. in 4.7.5 of the RT-11 and RT-11N Districts Schedule, “the side facing the street or rear
property line, common open space, park or school, is open or protected by guards that
do not exceed the required minimum height,”; and
d) in the Southeast Granville Slopes Official Development Plan, in section 6.3.3 (a), remove the
word ‘residential’ as the floor space ratio exclusion applies to non-residential floor area also.
As the posted amending by-laws for this item contain the changes outlined above, no action was
required by Council.
