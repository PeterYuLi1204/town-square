amended
AMENDMENT MOVED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
SECONDED by Councillor Fry
THAT Appendix B of the Referral Report dated November 26, 2019, entitled “CD-1 Text
Amendment: 1980 Foley Street”, be amended by inserting the following text at the end of
the recommendation in A:
and that the conditions of approval of form of development 1.2 and 1.7 are struck
out and substituted with the following:
1.2 Design development to ensure the access from the public plazas
on Great Northern Way and Foley Street remain legible. The
following should apply:
a. Avoid placing heavy columns along the retail and
restaurant front;
b. Maintain a high degree of visual porosity between the
interior and exterior with the use of clear glass; and
c. Ensure weather-protection systems and retail layouts at
the subsequent development permit stages will not
obscure sightlines into the interior.
(Note to Applicant: The intent of this condition is to ensure the public
realm around the building can be adequately animated, hence being
aligned with the Broadway Plan’s broader aims to improve Great Northern
Way as a pedestrian-oriented route. In the case of this building, where

Public Hearing
Minutes, Thursday, January 23 and 30, 2020 14
there are public plazas and interior atriums, the interior-exterior
connection is important.)
1.7 Design development to further demonstrate how natural systems
and biodiversity can be introduced to the China Creek Greenway.
(Note to Applicant: Work closely with City staff in Landscape Planning
and Engineering to refine the China Creek Right of Way design to
emulate marshlands historically in that area. Explorations of how the
China Creek linear public open space can be more integrated into the
building entry design along the east elevation are crucial. This condition
should be cross-referenced to the urban design condition on improving
the interior-exterior connection on the east façade, as well as the
corresponding landscape conditions regarding China Creek.)

a. Avoid placing heavy columns along the retail and
restaurant front;
b. Maintain a high degree of visual porosity between the
interior and exterior with the use of clear glass; and
c. Ensure weather-protection systems and retail layouts
at the subsequent development permit stages will not
obscure sightlines into the interior.
(Note to Applicant: The intent of this condition is to ensure the public
realm around the building can be adequately animated, hence being
aligned with the Broadway Plan’s broader aims to improve Great
Northern Way as a pedestrian-oriented route. In the case of this
building, where there are public plazas and interior atriums, the
interior-exterior connection is important.)
1.7 Design development to further demonstrate how natural
systems and biodiversity can be introduced to the China Creek
Greenway.
(Note to Applicant: Work closely with City staff in Landscape Planning
and Engineering to refine the China Creek Right of Way design to
emulate marshlands historically in that area. Explorations of how the
China Creek linear public open space can be more integrated into the
building entry design along the east elevation are crucial. This
condition should be cross-referenced to the urban design condition on
improving the interior-exterior connection on the east façade, as well
as the corresponding landscape conditions regarding China Creek.)
B. THAT A above be adopted on the following conditions:
(i) THAT the passage of the above resolutions creates no legal rights for the
applicant or any other person, or obligation on the part of the City; and
any expenditure of funds or incurring of costs is at the risk of the person
making the expenditure or incurring the cost;
(ii) THAT any approval that may be granted following the Public Hearing
shall not obligate the City to enact a by-law rezoning the property, and
any costs incurred in fulfilling requirements imposed as a condition of
rezoning are at the risk of the property owner; and
(iii) THAT the City and all its officials, including the Approving Officer, shall
not in any way be limited or directed in the exercise of their authority or
discretion, regardless of when they are called upon to exercise such
authority or discretion.
