vital role in the national economy and serving as a major engine of trade,

in increased truck traffic through residential corridors including Powell Street,
Dundas Street, Nanaimo Street, and McGill Street;

city, which included a goal to “advocate for the port to reopen Clark Drive as the
primary north-south access point for port facilities” before 2017;
5. Residents have reported excessive noise, ground-shaking vibrations, and
adverse effects on their health, safety, and quality of life—particularly for children
and families;

abatement measures, time-of-day restrictions, and route buffering—to reduce
harm to affected neighborhoods.

The Committee heard from one speaker who spoke in opposition to the motion.

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, September 17, 2025 14
MOVED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
SECONDED by Councillor Zhou
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. The City of Vancouver’s Capital Plan is a four-year financial strategy that guides
investment in essential infrastructure and public amenities, including water and
sewer systems, roads, sidewalks, curb cuts, lighting and bikeways, traffic and
pedestrian signals, community centres, recreational facilities including pools,
sports fields and rinks, arts and culture spaces, firehalls, parks, public spaces,
the urban forest and libraries;
2. Development of the 2027–2030 Capital Plan presents a critical opportunity for
Council to reaffirm its commitment to addressing the City’s growing infrastructure
deficit and to prioritize delivery of public-serving projects over prolonged planning
efforts;
3. The current 2023–2026 Capital Plan includes $3.5 billion in investments, but
historical trends show increasing planning expenditures and fewer completed
projects within a single capital cycle, delaying the delivery of tangible benefits to
residents;
4. Vancouver faces compounding challenges, including aging infrastructure (such
as pipes from the late 19th and mid-20th centuries, and community centres built
in the 1940s–1980s), escalating construction costs, and declining revenue from
development contributions due to economic conditions and policy shifts that
prioritize rental and affordable housing;
5. These conditions require the City to adopt a more nimble, outcome-driven
approach that focuses on delivering fully funded, shovel-ready projects within
shorter timeframes, and avoids allocating resources to planning efforts where
capital funding is unlikely to materialize in the foreseeable future;
6. Disparities persist between neighbourhoods in terms of access to public
amenities and community infrastructure, including ice rinks, firehalls, and
community centres as examples, and must be addressed through equitable
capital planning; and
7. In a rapidly growing and increasingly unaffordable city, refreshed playgrounds,
renewed dog parks, and small-scale upgrades to local facilities can be just as
impactful to residents' quality of life as large, high-profile capital projects.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to prioritize the renewal and delivery of core community
facilities and essential infrastructure in the 2027–2030 Capital Plan, with
particular focus on aging and end-of-life assets.

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, September 17, 2025 15
B. THAT Council direct staff to prioritize projects that are fully or substantially
funded and can be completed within the Capital Plan cycle, and to deprioritize
planning initiatives where funding is uncertain or unavailable within a reasonable
timeframe.
C. THAT Council direct staff to report back, in advance of Council’s consideration of
the draft 2027–2030 Capital Plan, with a comprehensive inventory of the City’s
community facilities and core infrastructure, including the age, expected lifespan,
and current condition of each asset, to support evidence-based decision-making
during Capital Plan deliberations.
amended
AMENDMENT MOVED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
SECONDED by Councillor Dominato
THAT the following be added as D:
THAT Council direct staff to report back as soon as practically possible on
options to implement a rigorous capital asset management framework that would
help guide decision-making and enhance the City’s capital plans as identified by
the Mayor’s Budget Task Force in their January 2024 report and further
corroborated in the recently released Recreation Facility Asset Management
Report from the City’s Auditor General;
FURTHER THAT Council acknowledge the importance of this work for guiding
capital investment and stewarding the full lifecycle, optimization and use of City’s
facilities, infrastructure and community assets, as underscored by the Auditor
General’s Report that identifies that 72% of recreation facilities were in poor or
very poor condition, from an asset management perspective, based on the cost
of required repairs and maintenance relative to the facility’s replacement value,
and that a CAMP provides a best practice baseline for decision-making.

impactful to residents' quality of life as large, high-profile capital projects.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to prioritize the renewal and delivery of core community
facilities and essential infrastructure in the 2027–2030 Capital Plan, with
particular focus on aging and end-of-life assets.
B. THAT Council direct staff to prioritize projects that are fully or substantially
funded and can be completed within the Capital Plan cycle, and to deprioritize

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, September 17, 2025 17
planning initiatives where funding is uncertain or unavailable within a reasonable
timeframe.
C. THAT Council direct staff to report back, in advance of Council’s consideration of
the draft 2027–2030 Capital Plan, with a comprehensive inventory of the City’s
community facilities and core infrastructure, including the age, expected lifespan,
and current condition of each asset, to support evidence-based decision-making
during Capital Plan deliberations.
D. THAT Council direct staff to report back as soon as practically possible on
options to implement a rigorous capital asset management framework that would
help guide decision-making and enhance the City’s capital plans as identified by
the Mayor's Budget Task Force in their January 2024 report and further
corroborated in the recently released Recreation Facility Asset Management
Report from the City’s Auditor General;
FURTHER THAT Council acknowledge the importance of this work for guiding
capital investment and stewarding the full lifecycle, optimization and use of City’s
facilities, infrastructure and community assets, as underscored by the Auditor
General’s report that identifies that 72% of recreation facilities were in poor or
very poor condition, from an asset management perspective, based on the cost
of required repairs and maintenance relative to the facility’s replacement value,
and that a CAMP provides a best practice baseline for decision-making.
3. Accelerating the Turf Field Upgrade at Beaconsfield Park for Inclusion in the
2027-2030 Capital Plan
The Committee heard from six speakers who spoke in support of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Dominato
SECONDED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. The Sport Field Strategy currently prioritizes the Beaconsfield Park gravel field
for conversion to a turf field in the 2031- 2034 Capital Plan;
2. At the July 7, 2025, meeting of the Vancouver Board of Parks and Recreation, a
motion entitled “Accelerating the Turf Field Upgrade at Beaconsfield Park for
Inclusion in the 2027-2030 Capital Plan” was unanimously supported by the Park
Board Commissioners;
3. Park Board staff have been directed to report back no later than Q1 2026 with a
detailed feasibility and funding framework to inform Capital Plan finalization and
potential partnerships;

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, September 17, 2025 18
4. The City of Vancouver is currently entering the planning phase for the 2027–
2030 Capital Plan, to be finalized in July 2026, providing a timely opportunity for
Council to prioritize and align a Beaconsfield Park turf field upgrade with
upcoming capital investment decisions;
5. The rationales presented at Park Board for accelerating the turf field upgrade at
Beaconsfield Park are equally valid for Council. These include:
• The gravel field at Beaconsfield Park is currently programmed for high
use by community sports organizations, and the site is already equipped
with field lighting, making it suitable for extended hours of play, including
evenings;
• The Italian Canadian Sports Federation (ICSF) Columbus FC that
primarily uses Beaconsfield Park has experienced substantial growth in
recent years in line with citywide trends. Club registration has increased
significantly reflecting Vancouver’s growing, diverse population and
heightened interest in accessible and inclusive team sports;
• In future, the Britannia Micro Footie Soccer Program could potentially
deliver soccer programming at Beaconsfield Park;
• Vancouver is a host city for FIFA World Cup 2026 and global attention
and community engagement in the sport are expected to surge further in
the years immediately preceding and following the tournament;
• Soccer is widely regarded to be one of the most accessible and inclusive
sports, as it can be adapted for all abilities and is played and followed in
nearly every country around the world;
• Soccer in Vancouver has one of the longest playing seasons of any sport,
as noted in the City’s own programming materials, yet the supply of high-
quality, all-season fields has not kept pace with demand;
• Synthetic turf fields can accommodate approximately 3.5 times more
usage annually than natural grass fields, making them a more efficient
investment for high-demand sports like soccer;
• Beaconsfield Park’s central location, multi-field layout, and existing
lighting infrastructure make it a highly cost-effective and strategic site for
an accelerated turf conversion;
• An accelerated synthetic turf field at Beaconsfield Park would exist in
close proximity to the renewed turf field at Vancouver Technical
Secondary School, creating opportunities for new synergies and the
hosting of tournaments and competitions; 1
• ICSF Columbus FC is actively exploring ways to contribute private or
partnership funding toward project enhancements, such as viewing

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, September 17, 2025 19
stands or auxiliary features, further reducing the financial burden on the
City;
6. The proposal to accelerate the Beaconsfield Park turf field conversion aligns well
with the goals and objectives of the VanPlay Master Plan, the Sport Field
Strategy, and the recently adopted Rupert and Renfrew Station Area Plan; and
7. Given that Beaconsfield Park already has field lighting and is situated in a
central, high-demand area, the accelerated conversion to synthetic turf is both
strategic and cost-effective and aligns with city-wide objectives to enhance sports
infrastructure.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOVED THAT Council direct staff to prioritize the Beaconsfield
Park gravel field turf upgrade for inclusion in the 2027–2030 Capital Plan, recognizing
the strategic opportunity presented by community demand, existing site readiness and
synergies, and the global momentum of FIFA 2026;
FURTHER THAT staff be directed to work with their Park Board counterparts to facilitate
any and all actions required to support the prioritization, acceleration, and inclusion of
the Beaconsfield Park gravel field turf upgrade in the 2027–2030 Capital Plan.
__________
1. On June 3, 2025, Council approved the renewal of the synthetic turf field at Vancouver Technical Secondary
School, as identified in the 2023-2026 Capital Plan and 2025 Park Board Capital Budget.

4. Creating Connections: Advancing a Transformative Active Transportation Pathway
in South Vancouver
The Committee heard from one speaker who spoke in support of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Klassen
SECONDED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. South Vancouver is experiencing population growth, particularly in the River
District and Marine Gateway neighbourhoods, where residents are seeking
sustainable, safe, and connected transportation options;
2. The growing Marine Gateway neighbourhood lacks access to greenways or
nearby outdoor spaces for people to safely walk, run, and roll;

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, September 17, 2025 20
3. Workers employed in South Vancouver’s industrial land area could benefit from
safe and convenient active transportation routes for their daily commuting;
4. TransLink’s Burrard Peninsula Area Transport Plan identifies Kent Avenue as a
corridor for a Major Bikeway Network (MBN), made up of traffic-protected and
traffic-calmed bikeways connecting Urban Centres and major destinations;
5. The CPKC (company name formed from merger of Canadian Pacific Kansas
City) railroad right of way (RoW) stretches from Boundary Road to Milton Street,
with much of it adjacent to Kent Avenue. The RoW provides a unique opportunity
to establish a continuous active transportation pathway that would serve
pedestrians, cyclists, e-scooter riders, and persons using mobility devices;
6. While a patchwork of pathways exists on portions of this corridor, upgrades are
needed to allow people to move safely along it without impeding goods
movement that is integral to doing business in the industrial area;
7. A continuous, protected pathway through the Kent Avenue corridor that
incorporates the railway RoW would offer a safe, direct, and scenic connection
between the River District and Marine Drive Canada Line Station at Marine
Gateway—promoting transit use, reducing vehicle dependence, and supporting
public health through active lifestyles;
8. Extending this pathway west of Oak Street via the West 75th Avenue
alignment—parallel to the Musqueam Midden (c̓əsnaʔəm)—offers an opportunity
to integrate cultural heritage awareness into the pathway experience;
9. Connecting the Kent Avenue corridor to the southern terminus of the Arbutus
Greenway would complete a sought-after east-west active transportation route
across South Vancouver that connects to the west side and False Creek, with
links to the City of Richmond via the Canada Line Bikeway;
10. The Arbutus Greenway demonstrates a successful precedent for transforming
former railway corridors into public active transportation routes, made possible by
ensuring the lands remain zoned for transportation uses and reserved for people
movement; and safeguarding the Kent Avenue corridor for similar future use
would ensure that generations to come benefit from safe, sustainable, and
connected mobility options; and
11. Coordinated planning with CPKC, TransLink, and the Musqueam Indian Band is
essential to ensure access to rights-of-way, secure long-term pathway tenure,
and respect cultural and jurisdictional priorities.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to initiate discussions with CPKC (Canadian Pacific
Kansas City), TransLink, and the Musqueam Indian Band for the purpose of
extending a publicly accessible active transportation pathway incorporating the
railway right of way through the Kent Avenue corridor between Boundary Road

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities

and Oak Street.
B. THAT Council direct staff to explore opportunities to extend the active
transportation corridor westward from Oak Street along the CPKC (Canadian
Pacific Kansas City) railway right of way and West 75th Avenue alignment to
connect with the Arbutus Greenway at Milton Street, including route mapping,
partnership models that respect the traditional territory of the Musqueam People,
and funding options.
C. THAT staff report back to Council with progress on the establishment of the
pathway, including costing and next steps for implementation, alignment with the
City’s Transportation 2040 strategy, and green transportation targets.

5. Beyond Arterials: Creating More Housing Options on Low-Traffic Streets
The Committee heard from 12 speakers who spoke in support of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Maloney
SECONDED by Councillor Orr
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. Young families find it profoundly difficult to build lives in Vancouver due to the
shortage of housing, and especially due to the shortage of housing that they want
most: in quiet neighbourhoods, on side streets, with access to mature trees and
greenspace;
2. Like many North American cities, Vancouver has long restricted the development
of apartment buildings and other higher-density forums to narrow strips along
arterial streets, consigning those who cannot afford more expensive housing to
live along these arterials, with less access to mature trees and more exposure to
dust, pollution and safety risks;
3. People exposed to traffic pollution are at significantly greater risk of respiratory
and cardiovascular disease (Mayer et al., 2024; Pindus et al., 2015). Residents
living on arterials typically face much higher baseline noise levels inside their
homes, which has documented negative cardiovascular effects (Juneau, 2023).
Providing the majority of housing on arterial roads gives young families little
choice as to where they can afford to raise their children;

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, September 17, 2025 22
4. Vancouver has a network of quiet, leafy streets that may be able to become
home to additional residents without substantially adding to congestion - the
active transportation network;
5. Vancouver has many world-class parks, which are presently accessible primarily
by people living in the single family detached home neighbourhoods around
them;
6. Current economic conditions have slowed new-home construction, particularly
large-scale projects. Easing of restrictions on smaller-scale apartment buildings
could help to stimulate our local economy by creating construction and
associated jobs and meeting demand to address Vancouver’s low vacancy rate;
7. Apartments can provide a more accessible option for seniors and disabled
people than multi-level single-family homes and townhouses when mobility
becomes difficult. A wider availability of housing choices in every neighbourhood
can allow residents to stay in their neighbourhoods for longer;
8. Allowing low to medium-rise apartment buildings on the City’s greenways, active
transport routes and on low-traffic streets around parks, would allow the gradual,
gentle densification of housing along these routes, providing more housing
options in every neighbourhood and giving more residents access to housing on
quieter streets;
9. Allowing housing to be built on side streets can reduce the displacement of
treasured independent retail businesses on high streets by artificially providing
greater incentives for redevelopment on commercial streets (White, 2025;
Vancouver Plan);
10. Senior governments have prioritized housing construction and are presently
providing substantial capital to finance necessary upgrades of associated
infrastructure;
11. Despite the shortage of housing, zoning for an adequate supply of housing has
been hampered by an infrastructure deficit. Identifying high-priority areas for net
new housing that also advances other policy goals is a financially prudent and
effective way to address the housing shortage;
12. Constrained housing supply requires more people who work in Vancouver to
commute from neighbouring municipalities, exacerbating the noise, pollution and
danger from motor vehicle traffic experienced by residents living on arterial
roads; and

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, September 17, 2025 23
13. In order to build a brighter, more prosperous and more vibrant future for
Vancouver, we need to build the homes on quiet, leafy streets that allow families
to build the lives they want in the city they love.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to:
1. Explore and report back on zoning changes that would allow, as a permitted use,
the following:
a. Residential and mixed-use apartment buildings of up to six floors with a
maximum FSR of 3.0;
b. Ground-floor commercial, including but not limited to ground-floor retail at
intersections. (the “Amended Zoning”).
2. Explore and report back on by-law amendments implementing the Amended
Zoning in the following areas:
a. Local streets adjacent to parks;
b. Local streets along existing and planned greenways and other designated
active transportation routes in the City of Vancouver.
Excluding:
a. Areas where the existing zoning already allows higher densities;
b. Existing commercially zoned areas.
3. For the zoning changes proposed in resolutions 1 and 2, undertake economic
feasibility analyses demonstrating rate of change scenarios.
4. Identify where existing infrastructure can support the Amended Zoning and
prioritize those areas for implementation of the Amended Zoning.
5. Engage with industry and experts to explore how new buildings can be designed
to limit stormwater discharge levels, similar to existing direction for single family
homes.
6. Identify funding opportunities from senior levels of government to support any
required stormwater, sewer, or other infrastructure upgrades needed to service
the Amended Zoning and
7. Report back to City Council with an implementation plan timeline and budget,
and where possible, leverage the current Vancouver Official Development Plan
and other relevant consultations and policy process.

6. Removing Obstacles Preventing Sustainable Food Systems in Vancouver
The Committee heard from three speakers who spoke in support of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Maloney
SECONDED by Councillor Orr
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. Vertical farming, also known as Controlled Environment Agriculture, produces
crops indoors using hydroponics, artificial lighting, and other technologies to
carefully control growing conditions;
2. Vertical farming businesses can be established in underutilized urban spaces—
including buildings, parkades, and other non-standard sites that are difficult to
lease for traditional commerce due to factors such as inadequate loading areas
or insufficient ceiling heights;
3. Vertical farming businesses strengthen local food security by expanding our
ability to produce food locally year-round, reducing our reliance on imports. For
example, as of 2022 British Columbia was importing 81% of its spinach and 70%
of its lettuce from the United States (Bajaj and Ramankutti, 2025;
Wickramasinghe, 2025);

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, September 17, 2025 25
4. Vertical farms create local jobs and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by
shortening food transport distances. Vertical farms can quickly respond to
changing consumer demand and can produce low-volume, niche, or culturally
important plants, benefiting restaurants, hotels, and catering and grocery
businesses, as well as residents;
5. Currently, Urban Farm Class B businesses—the City’s designation for vertical
farms—are only permitted as conditional uses in all relevant zoning district
schedules. This forces proponents to navigate a complicated, time-consuming
and costly review and permitting process;
6. The City of Vancouver recognises the challenges of the current permitting
process for vertical farms and has previously granted development permits that
grant relaxations to work-around by-laws created when vertical farming was a
fledgling industry;
7. Vertical farming businesses often have the opportunity to operate on multiple
floors of a building, but City regulations currently limit Urban Farms to a single
floor in many industrial district schedules (such as I-1, I-1A, I-1B, I-2, I-3, IC-1,
and IC-3), preventing farms from taking full advantage of available space to
maximise crop yield;
8. Certain by-law requirements intended for larger commercial operations—for
example, design standards for loading zones—undermine the commercial
viability of smaller vertical farms that may wish to operate on non-standard sites;
9. Possible solutions to the challenges faced by vertical farming businesses include
changing Urban Farm Class B from a conditional approval use to an outright
approval use and categorizing vertical farms as temporary structures. The City
already provides avenues for permitting temporary structures and farm buildings
(Building By-law No. 14343 s. 1.1.1.1), and this may offer a streamlined process
similar to existing exemptions for construction, outdoor patios and other
temporary uses;
10. Vertical farming businesses are ineligible for the support and assistance that the
province provides traditional agribusinesses. The City of Vancouver restricts
Urban Farm Class B operational size to 7,000 m2 This prevents vertical farm
operators from applying to the province for farm status Urban Farm Guidelines s.
2.2 (iv)), as BC Assessment will not approve farm classification for vertical farms
unless they are on leased land outside the Agricultural Land Reserve and are at
least 8,000 m² ((Classification of Land as a Farm Regulation (B.C. Reg. 411/95));
and

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, September 17, 2025 26
11. The City could help level the playing field for vertical farming operations with
traditional agricultural operations by enabling vertical farms to operate on multiple
floors of a building and removing the 7,000 m2 size cap.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to:
A. Explore and report back on the feasibility and implications of:
i. Streamlining the change-of-use process for farms seeking Urban Farm
Class B licenses, especially those which are not making significant
changes to the structure of an existing building;
ii. Designating Urban Farm Class B as an outright approval use instead of a
conditional approval use for certain zoning district schedules;
iii. Revisiting the 1:1 Floor Space Ratio requirement for Urban Farm Class B
operations in selected district schedules, which would allow Controlled
Environment Agriculture on multiple levels of a building; and
iv. Allowing vertical farm businesses to operate in underutilised spaces, such
as parkades.
B. Write to British Columbia’s Ministry of Agriculture to express the City of
Vancouver’s support for extending to vertical farming businesses the same
benefits and subsidies provided to traditional agriculture.

The Committee heard from eight speakers who spoke in support of the motion and one speaker
who spoke in opposition.

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, September 17, 2025 27
MOVED by Councillor Orr
SECONDED by Councillor Maloney
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. The Empty Homes Tax, (also known as the “Vacancy Tax”), was introduced in
2017 with the goal of returning empty and under-utilized properties to the market
as long-term rental homes for people who live and work in Vancouver;
2. The Empty Homes Tax has been a success so far, generating $169.8 million of
net revenues between 2017 and 2023 to support affordable housing initiatives in
Vancouver, and reducing the number of known vacant properties in Vancouver
during that period by 58%;
3. In 2023, City Council approved a proposal to freeze the Empty Homes Tax at
3%, stopping a previously planned increase to 5% that City Council had
approved in 2020;
4. In 2023, City Council approved a new exemption for “vacant new inventory” -
meaning that newly built condos that are unsold and sitting empty can remain
untaxed and empty in perpetuity;
5. These changes combined represent a significant amount of lost revenue for
badly needed affordable housing programs in Vancouver; and
6. Stronger enforcement for the Empty Homes Tax would generate significant
revenue: Vancouver’s 2024 Empty Homes Tax Annual Report indicates that
“Revenue generated from non-compliant audits during the period from
November 2, 2023 to November 1, 2024 was $18.8 million.”
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to bring forward amendments to the Vacancy Tax
By-Law to increase the rate from 3% to 5% for 2026.
B. THAT Council direct staff to bring forward amendments to the Vacancy Tax
By-Law to impose a partial tax on currently-exempted “vacant new inventory” at a
rate of 1% starting in 2026.
C. THAT Council direct staff to report back in Q2 of 2026 with recommendations for
a graduated Vacancy Tax on unsold new builds that starts at 1% and increases
each year to disincentivize the under-use of properties.

8. Greening the City – Enhancing Livability and the Tree Canopy Through Healthy
Afforestation
The Committee heard from one speaker who spoke in support of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Fry
SECONDED by Councillor Orr
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. Afforestation is the process of transforming of non-forest into forest land. Distinct
from reforestation, the process of replanting trees where forests were removed,
afforestation seeks to create new complete forests were there are none (or in the
case of Vancouver, for 150 years);

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, September 17, 2025 29
2. Urban forests play a critical role in improving air quality, reducing heat island
effects, supporting biodiversity, and enhancing the overall health and well-being
of residents. Equitable access to green space supports livability, particularly in
underserved and high-density neighbourhoods;
3. In Vancouver, the urban forest is typically defined by our tree canopy. From the
Urban Forest Action Plan of 2012 1 to the Urban Forest Strategy of 2025 2 the
primary metric to define the health, vitality and state of the urban forest has been
a measure of tree canopy coverage;
4. Vancouver’s tree canopy is experiencing multiple pressures, from development,
aging tree stock, heat stress, and drought resulting from climate change.
Infestations are another climate-related threat to Vancouver’s tree canopy,
particularly in arboreal monocultures typical to public trees, where large
homogenous population of single tree species can allow diseases and migrant
pests like the Looper Moth, Ash Borer, or Japanese Beetle to thrive and spread
rapidly, potentially decimating tree stock;
5. Tree canopy and urban forest are not synonymous. The urban tree canopy is a
two-dimensional measure of the urban forest, representing the extent of tree
cover when viewed from above. The urban forest is the entire collection of trees,
plants, and other organic elements that exist, including not just the visible foliage
from above (the canopy), but also the stems, roots, soil, ground cover, and
understory vegetation that contribute to the broader ecosystem;
6. Afforestation, the creation of healthy forest ecosystems in places they otherwise
don’t exist, considers greening beyond adding trees. While trees are important,
the bigger picture is restoring a working, balanced forest ecosystem that is more
resilient, improves soil, manages water, suppresses invasive species while
supporting birds, pollinators, and other wildlife. Afforestation can contribute to
climate and disease resilience, carbon sequestration, heat island mitigation,
livability, and community engagement in environmental stewardship;
7. Miyawaki forests, or "mini forests," are dense, small-scale woodlands of native
trees and shrubs planted to rapidly accelerate forest growth in urban or degraded
areas. Developed fifty years ago in Japan by botanist Akira Miyawaki, this
technique creates a multi-layered, self-sustaining forest ecosystem that grows
quickly and provides numerous environmental benefits. The Miyawaki method
has inspired micro-forest solutions adapted to local conditions in cities around the
world as an effective tool for greening cities in dense urban environments from
Asia to Europe,3 to Canada;4

8. Compared to more traditional short-term approaches to urban forestry that focus
on planting trees, the Miyawaki method may be a more effective long-term
strategy to generate tree canopy, while creating dense, self-sustaining and
resilient forests adapted to small spaces; 5
9. Under the current City of Vancouver Tree By-law and policies regarding property
development tree requirements and replacement, trees planted to meet permit
requirements, aren’t necessarily planted or maintained for health and survival.
Tree Bylaw updates anticipated to come forward to Council in early 2026 may
address this and afforestation techniques could support viability of tree retention;
and
10. Vancouver’s Urban Forestry Strategy report back on priority actions is scheduled
for 2026, and includes advancing a canopy modelling study to better understand
available planting space and determine private and public land contribution for
equitable and strategic long-term urban forestry planning, as well as Ecological
Network implementation, a joint initiative between Planning and Environmental
Services in collaboration with Parks and Engineering toward developing a model
of connected ecological network across the city.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to report back on actions to support afforestation and
micro-forest initiatives across the city and integrating them into existing work on
forestry and tree canopy, including the Urban Forestry Strategy and Ecological
Network implementation, with a focus on:
• Planting native and climate-resilient trees, ground cover, and understory
vegetation;
• Prioritizing areas with low canopy coverage, poor soil, and/or vulnerability
to climate impacts;
• Ensuring long-term financial capacity to support these afforestation
initiatives; and
• Integrating afforestation into new developments, public spaces, and
transportation corridors.
B. THAT Council request staff to report back as part of work underway, on:
• Funding mechanisms, including partnerships with community
organizations, provincial and federal programs, and private sector
contributions;
• Opportunities for community-led planting, afforestation, and stewardship
initiatives;
• Metrics and timelines for monitoring forest and canopy growth and

9. Strengthening Public Trust and Transparency Through Full Disclosure of Total
Council Compensation
MOVED by Mayor Sim
SECONDED by Councillor Zhou
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. Transparency, accountability, and responsible stewardship of public funds are
essential principles in maintaining the public's trust in elected officials and local
government;
2. Members of Vancouver City Council may be appointed to serve on external
agencies, regional bodies, and intergovernmental organizations, such as Metro
Vancouver, TransLink, E-Comm 911, the Municipal Finance Authority, the Union
of BC Municipalities (UBCM), and the Federation of Canadian Municipalities
(FCM), which often provide additional financial compensation for meeting

attendance, official representation, and/or other duties;
3. This additional financial compensation, which may include stipends, per diems,
travel allowances, retainers, expense reimbursements, or other forms of
payment, is ultimately drawn from public funds, either directly or through
municipal contributions to these agencies and organizations;
4. The public, media, and even fellow elected officials may currently find it difficult to
obtain a full accounting of the total compensation received by elected
representatives across all their publicly funded roles, due to inconsistent or
inaccessible reporting standards across organizations;

transparency, not only with respect to how much money elected officials earn as
members of Council, but also about the broader systems of remuneration
connected to their official duties on external bodies; and
6. Public reporting of all remuneration associated with elected office serves to
prevent conflicts of interest, and ensure that compensation remains appropriate,
justified, and commensurate with public expectations and the responsibilities
involved.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to prepare and publish an
annual public financial disclosure report, beginning with the 2024 calendar year, to be
posted on the City of Vancouver website in a timely, clear, standardized format that is
easily accessible and navigable by the public, detailing the total compensation received
