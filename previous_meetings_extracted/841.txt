Following the Chair’s ruling, Councillor De Genova rose on a point of order per Section 8.7 of

Procedure By-law and asked the Chair to rule if the amendment was out of order on the basis of

6. Taking Steps Toward a National Cost-Shared Universal Healthy School Food
Program
At the Council meeting on March 10, 2020, Council referred the following motion to the Standing
Committee on Policy and Strategic Priorities meeting on March 11, 2020, in order to hear from
speakers.
The Committee heard from three speakers in support of the motion.

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, March 11, 2020 9
MOVED by Councillor Bligh
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. The City of Vancouver recognizes that access to sufficient, safe, nutritious, and
affordable food is fundamental to health and equality;
2. The Vancouver Food Charter, dating from January 2007, states that food is “a
basic human right” and that all residents need accessible, affordable, healthy,
and culturally appropriate food, with children in particular requiring adequate
amounts of nutritious food for normal growth and learning;
3. In January 2013, Vancouver City Council adopted the Vancouver Food Strategy,
an official plan and road map that integrates a full spectrum of urban food system
issues within a single policy framework that includes food production, food
processing, distribution, food access and food waste management, and builds on
years of food systems initiatives and grassroots community development that
considers all aspects of the food system. Vancouver's food strategy goals
express how the City wants the food system to take shape in the future;
4. In October 2014, Council adopted the Healthy City Strategy, which includes a
goal to ensure that Vancouver’s children and youth, up to age 24, have the best
chance of enjoying a healthy childhood;
5. In December 2014, Council unanimously adopted a motion asking City staff to
identify $400,000 in the City’s operating budget to expand access to healthy
foods for school-aged children. These funds enabled meal programs through
Vancouver School Board and the Strathcona Community Centre Association
between 2015 and 2018;
6. The Vancouver School District’s Food4School program, which was established in
2015/2016, received $222,895 from the City during that school year and received
$320,000 from the City in the 2016/2017 and 2017/2018 school years;
7. In June 2017, Council unanimously adopted a motion for submission to the Union
of BC Municipalities and the Federation of Canadian Municipalities (UBCM)
calling on UBCM to advocate for a Universal Healthy School Food Program to
the provincial and federal governments, in light of the ongoing fact that Canada is
one of the only industrialized countries without a national school meal program;
8. In September 2017, the City of Vancouver made a submission to the Federal
Government’s National Food Policy consultation process, noting the City’s
concern regarding increasing levels of food and income insecurity among
Vancouver residents and stating that “Individuals living with food insecurity report
poorer health, higher rates of obesity, poorer mental health and more mood and
anxiety disorders” as well as observing that health care costs are 76% higher for
individuals who are food insecure;
9. Among the City of Vancouver’s recommendations to the Federal Government’s
National Food Policy consultation in September 2017, there was a

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, March 11, 2020 10
recommendation for the Federal Government to work with the Provinces and
Territories to create a cost-shared universal healthy school food program to
ensure that all school children learn basic food skills and have access to healthy,
nutritious meals every day, in accordance with the view that school meal
programs not only benefit classroom learning, but also model healthy eating,
teach food skills, and serve to eliminate stigma through universality;
10. At the April 2018 Annual General Meeting of the BC School Trustees Association
(BCSTA), the membership passed a resolution calling on the BCSTA to, among
other things, “endorse the Coalition for Healthy School Food’s national Universal
Healthy School Food Program campaign” and for the “Ministry of Health and the
provincial Ministry of Health [to] provide new money to invest in a cost-shared
Universal Healthy School Food Program,” in recognition of the fact that ensuring
the life-long health and success of children and youth is proper nutrition and that
the establishment of healthy eating habits, along with the provision of appropriate
foods during a student’s developmental years, is critical to building not only a
base for success in school but a foundation for life-long health;
11. In addition to the BC School Trustees Association’s official endorsement of the
Coalition for Healthy School Food and its call for the development of a universal,
cost-shared School Food Program for Canada, numerous other organizations
have officially endorsed the Coalition and its call including the Vancouver District
Parent Advisory Council (DPAC), Family Services of Greater Vancouver, the
Federation of Canadian Municipalities, IUOE Local 963, and the City of Victoria
among others;
12. In 2018, the City of Vancouver proclaimed March 1, 2018, as “Great Big Crunch
for Healthy School Food Day” in Vancouver, and did so again in 2019. The Great
Big Crunch is a national movement and annual moment of anti-silence in which
students, teachers, parents and others passionate about food join the food
movement and crunch into apples (or other crunchy fruit or vegetable) to make
noise for healthy school food;
13. A September 18, 2018, staff report to Vancouver City Council entitled “City
Support for Healthy School Meal Programs” cites research showing that “every
student would benefit from access to a meal program, as these programs show
positive benefits not only on reducing school day hunger, but on improving
academic achievement, physical and mental well-being, and fruit and vegetable
consumption (Coalition for Healthy School Food, 2016). School meal programs
are also well placed to model systemic changes on environmental sustainability
and local agriculture through procurement practices”;
14. On March 19, 2019, Finance Minister Bill Morneau tabled Budget 2019 in which
the federal government committed to developing a “Food Policy for Canada” with
the intention to “set out a coordinated and collaborative approach to addressing
food-related issues” in Canada;
15. The federal government’s Food Policy for Canada initiative states that it is a
“roadmap for a healthier and more sustainable food system for Canada” that,
among other objectives, is taking the first consultative steps alongside provinces,
territories, and not-for-profit organizations towards the creation of a National

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, March 11, 2020 11
School Food Program, in order to help improve the health of Canada’s children
as they learn, leading to better futures for them, and ultimately for our country;
16. In September 2019, the Vancouver School Board (VSB) passed a motion
requesting that school district staff “create a holistic 10 Year Vision and Food
Framework for the District” with the work to include:
• a 10-year vision for the District that would include a Food Framework
incorporating relevant key components including but not limited to: food
growing, production, distribution, nutrition, waste, security, donations,
education, funding and lobbying that is in alignment with the District’s
Strategic Plan and budget;
• formation of a Food Working Group made up of external representatives;
• Identifying the capital and operating costs associated with developing a Food
Framework and its implementation.
17. In November 2019, a consultant’s report commissioned by VSB staff noted that
the Vancouver School District delivers 15 different nutrition programs at 119
sites, with operational oversight of seven teaching cafeterias, and management
of FoodSafe and regulatory compliance in 30 commercial kitchens;
18. The City of Vancouver 2020 Budget and Five-Year Financial Plan, under the
Department Service Plan for Arts, Culture and Community Services,
recommended “an increase of $160,000 to reinstate grants for the Vancouver
School Board school food program that were reduced in 2019” and further, under
the heading “Looking ahead, 2021-2024”, noted an objective to “Update the
Vancouver Food Strategy by developing priority food actions for 2021-2030 and
targets for 2050 for integration within the City’s next environmental plan.”;
19. “Thousands of hungry kids are fed every day in VSB schools, sometimes
breakfast, sometimes a hot lunch and sometimes a delivered meal. Those meals
are provided in 32 Vancouver schools in neighbourhoods identified as
vulnerable.” (Tracy Sherlock / Vancouver Courier – November 25, 2019);
20. On February 13, 2020, Victoria City Council unanimously supported a motion
calling for the City of Victoria to “endorse the efforts of the Coalition for Healthy
School Food to advocate for a universal, cost-shared healthy school food
program…. based on a shared belief that all children and youth in British
Columbia should have daily access to healthy food at school.”;
21. The City of Vancouver has proclaimed March 12, 2020, as “The Great Big
Crunch for Healthy School Food Day” in the City of Vancouver (as in 2018 and
2019); and
22. The path to civic progress and a stable society – in Vancouver, throughout the
province of B.C., and across Canada – requires that we accept our social
responsibilities and act upon them, and although school meal programs cannot
address the root causes and totality of food insecurity, they do provide a stable
meal on school days to support student learning and are consistent with the

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, March 11, 2020 12
objectives of the City’s broader Food Strategy and the City’s Healthy City
Strategy.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Vancouver City Council direct the Mayor, on behalf of Council, to write to
the Prime Minister of Canada to encourage the Government of Canada to make

leadership already shown by the Government of Canada in working to create a
national food policy;

City and Council’s strong support for the Federal Government to work with the
Provinces, Territories, Indigenous communities, and non-profit groups to create a

teaching food skills.

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, March 11, 2020 16
FINAL MOTION AS APPROVED
A. THAT Vancouver City Council direct the Mayor, on behalf of Council, to write to
the Prime Minister of Canada to encourage the Government of Canada to make
the creation of a Cost-Shared Universal Healthy School Food Program a top
priority for the national agenda of the 43rd Parliament in 2020, consistent with the
leadership already shown by the Government of Canada in working to create a
national food policy, with copies of the letter sent to the Premier of British
Columbia and the Provincial Ministers responsible for school food, namely the
Ministers of Education, Health, and Agriculture;
FURTHER THAT Council’s letter to the Prime Minister should reference the
City and Council’s strong support for the Federal Government to work with the
Provinces, Territories, Indigenous communities, and non-profit groups to create a
Cost-Shared Universal Healthy School Food Program that ensures all school
children learn basic food skills and have access to healthy, nutritious meals every
day to support classroom learning while also modelling healthy eating and
teaching food skills.
B. THAT Vancouver City Council call on the Provincial Government to commit to an
universal, cost-shared, healthy school food program for all K-12 students in BC,
including an invitation to all parties represented in the Provincial Legislature to
support a universal, cost-shared, healthy school food program, and to work with
local non-profits and school communities to pilot and implement a flexible
program that respects local conditions and food cultures, while promoting
positive health and education outcomes;
FURTHER THAT Council direct the Mayor, on behalf of Council, to write to the
Premier and the Provincial Ministers responsible for school food, namely the
Ministers of Education, Health, and Agriculture, to advise them of Council’s
endorsement and strong, ongoing support for an universal, cost-shared, healthy
school food program for all K-12 students in BC, including a reference to the
positive physical and mental health outcomes of universal meal programs as well
as the agricultural market opportunities through institutional local food
procurement which is a stated priority of Ministry of Agriculture.
C. THAT Vancouver City Council direct staff to report back to Council, prior to the
2021 City of Vancouver Budget deliberations, regarding the status of, and
funding requirements of, the Vancouver School District’s existing food program(s)
for the 2021/22 school year;
FURTHER THAT Council direct staff to convey Council’s support and
encouragement to the School District for the creation of its “holistic 10 Year
Vision and Food Framework” and to note the opportunity for the City and the
School District to explore potential partnerships and alignments on shared
objectives relating to food, food security, and the fostering of healthy
communities within the city in the larger context of an anticipated Universal
Healthy School Food Program.

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, March 11, 2020 17
D. THAT Vancouver City Council and the City of Vancouver endorse the ongoing
efforts of the Coalition for Healthy School Food to advocate for a universal, cost-
shared healthy school food program based on the shared belief that all children
and youth in British Columbia should have daily access to healthy food at school.
Logistically, the mechanism to accomplish Council’s endorsement would require
Council to read and agree with the contents of the Coalition’s 2016 position
paper which seeks an investment by the federal government in a cost-shared
Universal Healthy School Food Program.
E. THAT Vancouver City Council direct staff to report back with the next update of
the Healthy City Strategy with recommendations of ways in which the City and
City staff could work with their respective counterparts in other B.C.
municipalities in order to share data that may be relevant to food matters and to
support each other in advocacy efforts toward a universal, cost-shared, healthy
school food program.
F. THAT Council direct staff to write to Union of BC Municipalities’ Health and
Social Development Committee to share outcomes of this motion, and request
follow-up on advocacy efforts and strategies arising from the UBCM approval of
Vancouver’s 2017 Resolution B127: National School Food Program, which
directed “… that UBCM and the Federation of Canadian Municipalities advocate
for a Universal Healthy School Food Program to provincial and federal
governments.”
G. THAT Council request staff to consider funding opportunities that may be
available to further the City of Vancouver’s commitment to participating in a
National Cost-Shared Universal Healthy School Food Program;
FURTHER THAT staff consider funding opportunities including but not limited, to
the City of Vancouver Sponsorship Policy, partnerships with non-profit
organizations and charitable foundations, restaurants and individual donors.

UNFINISHED BUSINESS
1. Water and Washrooms as a Human Right
At the Council meeting on March 10, 2020, Council referred the following motion to the Standing
Committee on Policy and Strategic Priorities meeting on March 11, 2020, in order to hear from
speakers.
Subsequently, at the Standing Committee on Policy and Strategic Priorities meeting on
March 11, 2020, the Committee heard from speakers and referred debate and decision on the
motion to the Council meeting immediately following the Standing Committee on Policy and
Strategic Priorities meeting, as Unfinished Business.

Council
Minutes, March 11 and 12, 2020 3
MOVED by Councillor Boyle
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. Almost 2 billion people around the world do not have access to clean drinking
water, 4 billion people face severe water scarcity and 2.5 billion people do not
have adequate sanitation;
2. The United Nations’ World Water Development Report stated that, “3.6 billion
people live in areas that are water scarce for at least a month per year,” and if we
do not take action, it will “increase to as many as 5.7 billion people by 2050.”;
3. On July 28, 2010, the United Nations General Assembly passed Resolution
64/292 recognizing the human right to water and sanitation and acknowledged
that clean drinking water and sanitation are essential to the realization of all
human rights;
4. On September 23, 2010, the United Nations Human Rights Council passed
Resolution 16/2 which affirmed that the rights to water and sanitation are part of
existing international law and confirms that these rights are legally binding upon
States. It also calls upon States to develop appropriate tools and mechanisms to
achieve progressively the full realization of human rights obligations related to
access to safe drinking water and sanitation;
5. The climate crisis further threatens our water supplies through more frequent
droughts and increased water demands;
6. The effects of climate change are already being felt on Vancouver’s water
supply, including the severe drought of 2015 and the increasing variability of
Vancouver’s snowpack;
7. The manufacturing, transportation, and disposal of single-use bottled water has
serious environmental ramifications, particularly impacting air quality and the
climate, consumes unnecessary resources such as oil in the manufacturing of
plastic bottles and fuels used in the transportation of bottled water to the
consumer, and creates significant recycling and waste disposal costs;
8. The privatization of drinking water often results in the commodification of fresh
water, restricting communities’ rights to access drinking water while prioritizing
the profits of multinational corporations;
9. The problems associated with the privatization of multinational corporation’s
access to drinking water was exemplified in 2015 when in the midst of a drought
the interest of local communities were pitted against the interests of Nestlé’s
access to an aquifer outside Hope;
10. Additionally, the cost of single-use bottled water makes it less accessible to low-
income residents than public water fountains;

Council
Minutes, March 11 and 12, 2020 4
11. Public ownership and operation of drinking water and wastewater treatment
systems have been fundamental to access and quality over the past century;
12. On June 29, 2001, the Greater Vancouver Regional District decided against the
privatization of the operation of a water filtration plant on the grounds of potential
free-trade lawsuits;
13. Tap water in the City of Vancouver is safe, healthy and accessible to residents
and visitors, is readily available at most indoor public facilities, and is
substantially more sustainable than bottled water;
14. Vancouver has temporary fountains and water trucks which it rents or provides
during particularly hot stretches or outdoor events;
15. Vancouver Civic Theatres do not currently have bottle fill services in place,
relying on the sale of bottled water, or concession staff filling water bottles which
slows down service;
16. On April 7, 2015, in recognition of the 2015 UN World Water Day, the Vancouver
School Board passed a motion to phase out the sale of bottled water at VSB
schools and facilities, including the introduction of water refilling stations and the
sale of reusable water containers.
17. In 2009, the “Blue Communities” Project was developed to respond to the various
threats posed by the commodification and privatization of the world’s drinking
water;
18. In BC, a number of communities have protected their water supplies from
privatization and increased water rates, including Nanaimo, Victoria, North
Vancouver, Burnaby, Abbotsford, and White Rock;
19. In 2011, the Union of BC Municipalities passed a resolution supporting Blue
Communities;
20. To become a Blue Community, a municipality must recognize water as a human
right; ban the sales of bottled water in public facilities and at municipal events
and commit to promoting publicly financed, owned and operated water and
wastewater services;
21. A critical aspect of a human rights approach to water is ensuring safe and
accessible access to public washrooms, a particularly important requirement in
making a city welcoming for seniors, children, people with disabilities, and people
with unstable housing; and
22. The UN World Water Day will be observed on March 22, 2020, the day highlights
the importance of freshwater, and advocates for the sustainable management of
freshwater resources.

Council
Minutes, March 11 and 12, 2020 5
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT the City of Vancouver endorses and supports the “Blue Communities”
project, and recognizes and affirms that access to water and sanitation services
are fundamental human rights.
B. THAT Council direct staff to prepare a report on the necessary policy and by-law
amendments required to align city services with a human rights centric approach

by-laws;
b. Providing an update on Council’s 2009 ban on the sale of bottled water in
municipal facilities and events, and a plan to phase out the sale of bottled
water, while increasing the availability of public water fountains and water
bottle filling stations;

universally accessible washroom facilities in transit hubs and high-foot
traffic areas, and improved wayfinding signage and digital mapping; and
d. Considering relevant safety and accessibility concerns for Vancouver
residents most vulnerable to the opioid crisis.
C. THAT Council direct the Mayor to write to the Federal Government advocating
that they enshrine the human right to water and sanitation in federal law, and

and build new systems, and further advocating that public infrastructure funding
only fund public projects.

2. Safety for Residents with Precarious Status: Delivering Access without Fear
At the Council meeting on March 10, 2020, Council referred the following motion to the Standing
Committee on Policy and Strategic Priorities meeting on March 11, 2020, in order to hear from
speakers.
At the Standing Committee on Policy and Strategic Priorities meeting on March 11, 2020, the
Committee heard from speakers and referred debate and decision on the motion to the Council
meeting immediately following the Standing Committee on Policy and Strategic Priorities
meeting, as Unfinished Business.
MOVED by Councillor Boyle
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. Vancouver has the second highest concentration of immigrants in Canada, and
migration to Vancouver is likely to increase due to global displacement caused by
climate change;
2. Many new residents arrive with temporary work permits that are tied to a single
employer; and are at risk of losing their status as a result of paperwork or
employer misconduct;
3. Vancouver residents deserve to feel confident in their safety using City services;
4. As San Francisco’s Sanctuary City Ordinance states, cities are safer for
everyone when:
all residents, regardless of immigration status, feel comfortable calling the
Police and Fire Departments . . . [and] accessing City public health
services and benefit programs;
5. In recognition of these conditions, Council adopted the Access to City Services
Without Fear (ACSWF) for Residents with Uncertain or No Immigration Status

Council
Minutes, March 11 and 12, 2020 11
policy in 2016, to enable “residents to use municipal services . . . without fear that
the City of Vancouver will ask for and provide information about their immigration
status to other institutions or orders of government unless required by law”;
6. Today, more than three years after the ACSWF policy was adopted, the policy
has not been fully implemented;
7. The ACSWF policy recognizes that:
a. “Immigration status is a social determinant of health”;
b. “Fear of harm, detention and deportation prevents people from seeking
the support they need from service groups and government agencies of
all types”;
c. “Women and children are especially affected when they cannot safely
access these supports, as partners, employers, and individuals are more
able to hold and abuse power over them”; and
d. “The voluntary disclosure of immigration status and enforcement of
immigration law is outside the scope of the City’s jurisdiction, and City
staff are not responsible for the enforcement of immigration law”;
8. Lack of safe and secure access to resources has and continues to result in an
atmosphere of fear, distrust, confusion, and even death for racialized,
undocumented, migrant, and refugee residents and communities in Vancouver:
a. Lucia Vega Jimenez, a 42-year Mexican hotel worker, died while in
Canadian Border Service Agency (CBSA)’s custody in December 2013
after being turned over to immigration authorities by Transit Police. In
2014, the community demanded an end to immigration detention, and a
Coroner’s Inquest identified various needed improvements within CBSA
correctional facilities. As part of their response, Transit Police ceased
their agreement with the CBSA; and
b. On August 19, 2019, CBSA raided the Hastings Racecourse because of
information provided by the BC Gaming Policy and Enforcement Branch.
Witnesses reported that CBSA staff harassed racialized employees
during the raid. CBSA arrested up to 26 employees, and at least seven
residents have since been ordered to leave Canada. It has been alleged
that a Gaming Policy and Enforcement employee falsified documents and
misled these residents; this employee was suspended with pay;
9. While there have been no reports made through the City’s processes,
communities have shared experiences of not being able to access City services
without fear in reports like Sanctuary Health’s 2018 “Still Waiting, Still Afraid:
Auditing Access Without Fear Policies in the City of Vancouver”;
10. Residents also report not being able to access City and civic services without
fear because different organizations funded by the City have inconsistent access
without fear policies;

Council
Minutes, March 11 and 12, 2020 12
11. These inconsistent policies and practices leave residents vulnerable to harm,
increase distrust, and prevent access to critical living, safety, emergency
housing, and community services. Staff awareness, training, and support is
essential to closing this gap and to ensuring that the ACSWF policy protects
residents when they access any front-line service;
12. Racialized residents are disproportionately criminalized and represented in the
justice system;
13. Dylan Mazur, lawyer with the BC Civil Liberties Association, was quoted in the
StarMetro Vancouver explaining that VPD’s guidelines were too unspecific to
offer guaranteed protection to undocumented people who wanted to come
forward as witnesses or victims of a crime:
“As a lawyer I cannot look at these guidelines and provide sound legal
advice whether someone should come forward as a victim . . . I am not
aware as a lawyer in what circumstances the Crown would require
someone’s immigration status for court process, or what specific offence
would require the disclosure of someone’s immigration status”;
14. In its 2019 “Update Regarding [VPD] Guidelines on Police Requests Related to
Immigration Status,” VPD reported having initiated an average of at least 23
queries per month to federal immigration authorities over an eight-month period
ending May 23, 2019;
15. As detailed in the 2016 ACSWF policy report, police departments in other cities
working to provide access without fear, including San Francisco and Los
Angeles, do not request or disclose information about the citizenship or migration
status of individuals unless required by law;
16. Residents deserve to be able to access emergency services for themselves and
their families without fear that they will be subjected to contact with correctional
or immigration enforcement systems;
17. Residents deserve regular, public updates about how the ACSWF policy is
proceeding so that they can make informed choices about accessing City
services; and
18. Council has an opportunity to demonstrate its leadership in supporting migrants’
safety by fully resourcing and implementing the policy it adopted, responding to
community calls for improvement, and urging other jurisdictions to follow
suit - especially around the core policy directive of “Relationship with CBSA”.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council recognize that a city where immigration status checks are only
performed when required by law would help create a city where residents, no
matter their immigration status, can truly access city and civic services, including
public safety services, without fear of deportation.
