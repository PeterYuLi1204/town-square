4. REZONING: 445 Kingsway and 2935 St. George Street
Prior to the start of the agenda item, Councillor Fry declared a conflict of interest as he may
have family members involved with the project. Councillor Fry left the meeting at 7:31 pm and
did not return for the conclusion of the hearing.
An application by Acton Ostry Architects Inc. was considered as follows:
Summary: To rezone 445 Kingsway and 2935 St. George Street from C-2 (Commercial)
District to CD-1 (Comprehensive Development) District, to permit the
development of a 14-storey mixed-use building. A building height of 47.65
metres (156.4 feet) and a floor space ratio (FSR) of 7.22 are proposed.
The General Manager of Planning, Urban Design and Sustainability recommended approval.
Council received two memorandums both dated June 23, 2020, from the General Manager,
planning, Urban Design and Sustainability.
The first memorandum provided information subsequent to the 2016 Public Hearing, the owner
chose not to proceed with satisfying the rezoning conditions required for enactment of the draft
CD-1 By-law. Instead, the owner chose to submit the proposal currently under consideration for
additional development potential under the Moderate Income Rental Housing Pilot Program (the
MIRHP Program). The two different Council approvals in principle in effect for this site, as the
previously approved rezoning of July 12, 2016 are still valid.
To address the potential of two different approvals in principle being in effect on the same
property, staff proposed an additional recommendation be added to the staff report for this
application - Referral report dated February 25, 2020, entitled ‘CD-1 Rezoning: 445 Kingsway
and 2935 St. George Street. This additional recommendation would immediately “rescind” the
previous approval in principle from July 12, 2016.
The second memorandum recommended additional conditions of approval which were
erroneously omitted from the staff report at the time of referral of this item to public hearing.
Staff proposed additional enactment conditions be added to the Engineering section of
Appendix B Part 2 of the Referral Report dated February 25, 2020, entitled “CD-1 Rezoning:
445 Kingsway and 2935 St. George Street”. This additional condition would secure funding for
the signal upgrades on Kingsway as a condition of By-law enactment.
The additional recommendations as contained in the two above-noted memorandums both
dated June 23, 2020, required approval by Council.
