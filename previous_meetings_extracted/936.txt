Iain Dixon, Assistant Director of Legal Services - Enforcement and Prosecutions, was present on
behalf of the City of Vancouver (COV). Mr. Francis Klimo was present on behalf of the Licencee.
At the commencement of proceedings, Mr. Dixon advised this appeal had been brought before
the Council pursuant to Section 275 of the Vancouver Charter, and noted Council’s discretionary
powers to uphold or overturn the decision of the Deputy Chief Licence Inspector to revoke the
Inter-Municipal Business Licence (the “Business Licence”) issued to 0850785 BC Ltd. aka/dba/or
ABC Tree Men & Consulting (the “Licencee”). He added that this particular type of business
licence, for regulatory purposes, was no different than a regular COV business licence. Mr. Dixon
also discussed the principles of natural justice, in particular the requirements of notice and the
opportunity to be heard.
Mr. Dixon referred the Panel to the reasons for the Deputy Chief Licence Inspector’s
recommendation to revoke the Business Licence issued to the Licencee, as set out in the
Notice of Hearing dated May 6, 2019. Specifically, the Deputy Chief Licence Inspector
recommended the Business Licence be revoked on the basis that there is a long history of
infractions by the Licencee and included numerous recent offences and convictions against the
Licencee. The most recent convictions and violations included the following:
• Trial date May 5, 2016 - charges included the topping of 2 trees to the extent that
they were unlikely to ever regain health or characteristic appearances and had
four (4) violations of the Protection of Trees By-law #9958. The Licencee was
convicted and ordered to pay $12,000;
• Trial date March 28, 2017 - charges included 24 counts, comprising of items from
the Protection of Trees By-law #9958 such as removal of trees without permit,
topping trees, climbing retention trees with spurs causing damage. The Licencee
was convicted and ordered to pay $18,000; and
• The Licencee had been charged with violations of the Protection of Trees By-law
#9958 at four (4) separate locations in 2018. The alleged violations include
removal of at least 10 trees without permits and an allegation that the Licencee
facilitated the destruction of a significant retention tree on Trinity Street. Trial
dates are pending for these violations.

Minutes, Wednesday, May 22, 2019 3
In support of the allegations set out in the above-noted reports and evidence, Mr. Dixon called
Sarah Hicks, Deputy Chief Licence Inspector, as witness.
Mr. Dixon and the Panel directed questions to the witness.
Mr. Klimo provided opening remarks and noted that he assumed the position of Director of the
company in August 2018, as his father, who owns the company, had semi-retired. Mr. Klimo
also acknowledged that while there were violations that occurred since he assumed the position
of Director, he felt it was part of the learning process and that his future intention was to avoid
further violations and to provide good community service.
The Panel directed questions to Mr. Klimo. Regarding the violation related to 2660 Trinity Street,
Mr. Klimo submitted that the tree was substantially damaged by a previous arborist already and
that his company did not remove the tree.
Mr. Dixon provided closing comments and noted that based on the evidence, City Council would
likely be in agreement with the Deputy Chief Licence Inspector’s recommendation to revoke the
Business Licence issued to the Licencee.
The Panel directed questions to Mr. Dixon.
