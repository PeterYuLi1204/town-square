MOVED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. The City of Vancouver’s mission is to create a great city that cares about its
people, its environment and opportunities for residents to live, work, and prosper.
2. A resilient, diverse economy fosters dynamic businesses and sustainable
employment opportunities.
3. Industrial businesses provide 60,000 jobs (58% of those deliver a living wage)
and circulate approximately $7 billion in revenues locally. One job in
manufacturing indirectly supports 3.5 jobs in other sectors.
4. Vancouver is experiencing an industrial affordability crisis (in addition to a
housing crisis) and has the lowest industrial vacancy rate in all North America.1
5. Industrial lease rates have tripled in Vancouver’s inner-city industrial districts in
the last five years.2

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, July 10, 2019 7
6. The industrial land crunch is resulting in displacement of SMEs from the city; up
to 50% of Vancouver’s industrial businesses think they may need to relocate in
the next two years.3
7. Pressure on industrial land is creating a struggle for industrial startups, artists,
and musicians and creating barriers to them gaining a foothold in Vancouver;
4
Vancouver’s startup ecosystem has dropped six places in ranking in 2019.
8. The industrial land crunch is also limiting Vancouver’s ability to scale green
businesses and reach sustainability goals – currently 10% of industrial
5
businesses self-identify as green businesses.
9. The industrial affordability crisis in Vancouver is the result of several global and
local forces, including lifting land values as well as landowners sitting on
industrial land as a form of real estate investment.
10. Encroachment of non-industrial uses on industrial lands including doggy
daycares, self-storage, and car dealerships which have low employment density
6
is reducing the amount of productive job space available.
11. Industrial land supply has not kept pace with increasing demand from a wide
variety of businesses, including film, television, & digital entertainment
companies; biotech, cleantech & agri-tech firms; and small manufacturers,
materials processors, & distributors.7
12. 565 hectares of industrial land have been rezoned to other uses in the last thirty
years (primarily to address housing issues), reducing the amount of total
employment space available in the city.8
13. Older industrial building stock does not meet needs of contemporary industrial
businesses; the average floorplate of industrial users have dropped and new
demands include increased power and digital connectivity needs.
14. Not addressing challenges faced by industrial operators in Vancouver could
mean that up to 50% of industrial businesses may be displaced from the city in
the next five years, taking with them 30,000 jobs, $3.6 billion in annual revenues,
and $1.2 billion in annual wages.

leaps in land values which we have sited in various reports on this issue

Insights report

several provincial reports including one on the Apparel industry and another on Food & Beverage. The
VEC also tracks data on growth in the digital entertainment, film and tv sectors

15. The cost of goods and services in the city will rise as services move further from
the urban core.
16. Traffic congestion and GHG emissions in the region would worsen given that
more than 50% of clients and 35% of suppliers for local industrial businesses in
the city are located in Vancouver.
17. The social, economic, environmental and cultural impacts of displacing our
industrial business community could limit Vancouver from reaching major goals
including:
• economic resilience given that Vancouver’s industrial businesses primarily
serve local clientele (50%) and underpin every other major sector in
Vancouver as they are the suppliers to all other sectors;
• climate emergency response – pollution free cars, trucks and buses will
require local and distributed smart logistics hubs and zero emissions fleet
infrastructure; and
• vibrant cultural life – industrial space is where arts production, music/theatre
rehearsal, artisanal making and all manner of cultural activities are fostered.
18. Since many businesses are on 3, 5, or 10-year leases, Vancouver is only
beginning to feel the impact of the drastic rise in industrial land values over the
past 5 years. These impacts are anticipated to worsen in the next one to five
years.
19. Cities around the world have been recognizing the need to protect urban
industrial activity including:
• San Francisco – PlaceMade is a non-profit industrial developer that secures
land through supportive policy, and SF Made directly supports Bay Area
manufacturers with programming;9 and
• New York – GMDC (a non-profit industrial developer) is highly supported by
NYC EDC to retrofit older industrial buildings into spaces for modern New
York – GMDC (a non-profit industrial developer) is highly supported by NYC
EDC to retrofit older industrial buildings into spaces for modern industrial
users, opening hundreds of thousands of square feet of affordable industrial
space over the past twenty years for modern industrial businesses.
20. Movements toward the development of a more circular economy, more demand
for locally designed and manufactured products, just-in-time delivery and zero
emissions transportation, are all anticipated to result in continued strong demand
for industrial space.
21. The industrial land crunch has led to the City of Vancouver Employment Lands
and Economy Review, as well as the formation of the Metro Vancouver Industrial
Lands Strategy Task Force.
9 These examples have come from direct conversations with these groups. Excellent resources on these
examples are published by the Urban Manufacturing Alliance

Minutes, Wednesday, July 10, 2019 9
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council acknowledges the immediacy and real impacts of the industrial
land crunch and the displacement of city-serving industrial operators from
Vancouver.
B. THAT Council direct staff to explore the impact of and report back on options for
freezing development applications for self-storage, car dealerships and other
non-industrial uses currently permitted in industrial districts as soon as possible,
giving consideration to whether these uses are displacing higher-productivity and
more job-intensive industrial operations.
C. THAT Council direct staff to undertake feasibility analysis to determine the
viability of making available for redevelopment industrial zoned land with the goal
of delivering affordable industrial space for start-ups, scale-ups and arts
production space. Staff to report back in-camera on options or models for (re)-

FURTHER THAT such report back includes a review of the governance policies
of the City’s Property Endowment Fund that might need to be considered to
enable such opportunities, as well considers potential eligibility criteria and
appropriate terms/length of market rate subsidies to ensure equity, and
encourage turnover and appropriate allocation of affordable space to support
those who need it most.
D. THAT Council direct staff to explore and report back as soon as feasible on
options to deliver an empty industrial spaces program that utilizes carrot and/or
stick approaches to ensuring industrial spaces are not sitting unnecessarily
empty or underutilized.
E. THAT staff identify recommendations to revise industrial permitting and licensing
processes to reflect modern and evolving industrial operations as part of the
planned overall licensing review slated to take place in 2020, and report back to
Council.
F. THAT Council direct staff to consider how regulatory tools could be utilized to
enable the creation/preservation of affordable light industrial space for
city-serving industrial operators as part of rezoning processes and density
bonusing.

9. Exploring Amendments to Short-Term Rental Policy and an Affordable Rental
Housing Fund at the City of Vancouver
At the Standing Committee on City Finance and Services meeting on June 26 and 27, 2019,
due to time constraints, the Committee referred the following motion to the Standing Committee
on Policy and Strategic Priorities meeting on July 10, 2019, to hear from speakers.
Councillor De Genova introduced the motion and the Committee asked clarifying questions.
The Committee heard from four speakers in opposition to portion c) of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor De Genova
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. There are opportunities for short-term rental accommodations to contribute to
affordable housing in the City of Vancouver.
2. The City of Vancouver defines a short-term rental as “a home, or room within,
rented for less than 30 days at a time”. To meet the City of Vancouver
requirements for a Short Term Rental, the home must be the principal residence
of the applicant and a license is required.
3. Three by-laws passed by City Council amend existing by-laws and allow the City
of Vancouver to license short-term rentals and enforce rules that prohibit short
term rentals from operating without a business license from the City of
Vancouver.
4. The City of Vancouver is in an affordability and housing crisis and is in need of
effective solutions to this crisis.
5. The City of Vancouver webpage dedicated to short-term rental accommodation
Information acknowledges that short-term rentals allow individuals to earn
additional income, provide short-term accommodation options within the city and
supports Vancouver’s tourism industry. Council heard public testimony from a
number of short-term rental operators who rely on this income to pay their
mortgages and save for education or retirement.
6. Council has not been presented with data showing the amount of long term rental
housing supply that has been added to the market because of the City of
Vancouver’s short-term Rental accommodation business license, enforcement
policies and regulation.

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, July 10, 2019 15
7. The City of Vancouver cites a main reason, for the new short-term rental
licensing and policy framework, is to increase the supply of long-term rental
housing.
8. Other cities including Seattle, have adopted ordinances allowing for regulated
growth in the short-term rental and vacation rental markets while applying a
nightly tax on stays to fund affordable housing initiatives.
THERFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to examine the current
Short-Term Rental Policy and report back to Council with any findings and
recommendations by June 2020, including consideration for:
a) Requiring the License holder to pay a fee, in addition to the Short-Term Rental
License Fee, calculated on the number of nights the rental was booked, and, that
any fees charged are allocated to the Affordable Housing Reserve;
b) Increasing the Short-Term Rental License Fee to strengthen the capacity of the
City of Vancouver to recover costs;
c) Amending eligibility requirements to allow each owner and each renter to apply
for a Short-Term Rental License in each residence;
d) Approving a maximum number of licenses issued, and specific to each of
Vancouver’s distinct 23 neighbourhoods; and
e) Requiring applicants seeking or renewing a City of Vancouver Short Term Rental
License to provide:
i) A sample of their planned listing;
