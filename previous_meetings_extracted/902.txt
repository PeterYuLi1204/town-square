13. Every Neighbourhood for Everyone: Permitting Temporary Modular Housing and
Low Income Housing as an Option in RS and RT Zones
At the Regular Council meeting on September 10, 2019, due to time constraints, Council
referred this matter to the Standing Committee on Policy and Strategic Priorities meeting on
September 11, 2019, to begin at 3 pm.
The following motion reflects changes to the original Notice of Motion which were accepted by
the Committee.
The Committee agreed to separate the components of the motion for the vote.
MOVED by Councillor Boyle
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. The abundance of people impacted by homelessness in Vancouver represents a
humanitarian crisis which the City of Vancouver is morally obligated to address.
2. On Wednesday, June 12, 2019, City of Vancouver staff released the 2019
homelessness count, which counted 2,223 Vancouverites who identified as
homeless, the highest number since the city began tracking. This figure is a two
percent increase from 2018, representing the fourth straight year the number of
individuals impacted by homelessness has grown.
3. These numbers express a slower growth rate of homelessness than in previous
years, demonstrating that the actions taken by the City, including the provision of
temporary modular housing complexes, are having a positive, though inadequate
impact.
4. Homelessness disproportionately impacts systemically marginalized communities
including: Indigenous peoples (39%), Individuals with mental health conditions
(44%), or those with physical disabilities (38%). 81% of respondents who
identified as homeless stated that they had lived in the City of Vancouver before
they became homeless.

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, September 11, 2019 11
5. As of July 2017, there were 4,789 individuals waitlisted for social housing in the
City of Vancouver. Also as of July 2017, there was a 43% decrease in private
Single Room Occupancy rooms affordable to those on Provincial assistance
since 2007.
6. The BC NDP rolled out its Rapid response to Homelessness program in 2017,
pledging $291 million to build 2,000 modular housing units province wide, 600 of
which were built in Vancouver, and an additional $170 million to operate them. In
the 2019 budget, the province announced another $76 million to build an
additional 200 modular units in BC.
7. In 2017, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau committed to cutting homelessness in
half in a 10 year time frame.
8. On July 29, 2011, Council endorsed the Housing and Homelessness Strategy
2012-2021 which includes strategic directions to create more affordable housing,
including housing that is affordable for low and moderate income households.
The Strategy strives to increase the variety of affordable housing options across
the entire housing continuum. (Policy Report, Development and Building re.
Temporary Modular Housing Definition and Regulations: Proposed Amendments
to Existing City-Owned CD-1 Sites, and Design Guidelines).
9. In 2011, Vancouver City Council passed the Motion, Modular Housing, which
directed the City Manager to undertake an expression of interest to ascertain the
range of possible ties and partnerships available to pursue an initiative involving
modular housing option, using city and private resources as an enabler, to
address unmet housing need while sufficient permanent housing stock is being
built.
10. In September 2016, City staff developed a three year shelter and housing
demand and supply plan to better understand when and where the pressures will
be experienced over the next three years as a result of the need to address the
increasing number of individuals experiencing street homelessness. Temporary
Modular Housing (TMH) is included in the three year plan because it provides an
opportunity to create more deeply affordable homes quickly and cost effectively.
11. On December 4, 2018, Vancouver City Council passed a Motion Calling for 600
More Units of Modular Housing in 2019, where by City Council directed staff to
find sites for 600 more modular housing units.
12. TMH targets low and moderate income households who have a need for
transitional accommodation, and provide residence with a number of supports,
such as life skills training as well as health and social services.
13. After a year of operations, many of the fears community members had about
TMH sites have subsided.
14. TMH housing is currently permitted in CD-1 districts, targeting vacant or under-
utilized sites pending development. Under current Vancouver zoning by-laws, the
land options for the provision of modular housing is extremely limited, and is
quickly diminishing, as the need for additional TMH and the relocation of current
TMH becomes necessary.

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, September 11, 2019 12
15. The current limitation of TMH housing being solely single occupancy units has
the unintentional impacts of prioritizing individuals while excluding low-income
families, mothers and youth. There is a significant need to expand modular
housing to include family-sized units, to meet the needs of these residents of our
city.
16. Some areas of Vancouver remain predominated RS and RT zones, resulting in
high housing prices and very limited land options for temporary modular housing
under current by-laws.
17. Where zoning by-laws are overly restrictive and segregate uses unnecessarily,
they can act as impediments to healthy urban development.
18. Amending Vancouver’s zoning by-laws to permit modular housing on RS and RT
zones would provide the necessary options to meet the growing demand for
modular housing and will significantly impact the unprecedented levels of
homeless in the city of Vancouver.
19. Those experiencing homelessness come from every neighbourhood of our city,
and so housing for homeless and low-income residents should be available in
every neighbourhood of our city.
20. Vancouver City Council is considering launching a City Wide Planning Process,
where prior, City Council has expressed key goals and objectives to guide a city-
wide planning effort, which includes:
a. Maintaining Vancouver as a diverse and inclusive community;
b. Increasing and protecting housing supply that is locally affordable;
c. Enhancing social well-being; and
d. Planning for complete neighbourhoods, exploring new housing types and
densities.
21. What is needed is permanent affordable housing, across the city. Modular
housing is a relatively inexpensive opinion and can be built more quickly than
traditional construction projects. Given the urgency of homelessness, temporary
modular housing is needed too.
22. Homeless is not restricted by municipal or territorial boundaries and requires a
joint approach, across jurisdictional lines, to successfully address all causes of
homelessness and to provide the necessary services to immediately confront this
humanitarian crisis.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to:
i. Explore and report back on opportunities to deliver TMH buildings for
homeless residents, on RS and RT zoned parcels on private and City
owned land that could accommodate the footprint, access to services
and/or transit, timing of future uses, and site conditions by Q4 2019.

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, September 11, 2019 13
ii. If opportunities exist then the report back should identify policy tools that
may be required to advance delivering TMH on RS or RT zones, including
but not limited to, changes to the Vancouver Charter to enable Director of
Planning authority to relax for “low cost housing for persons receiving
assistance” in RS and RT areas, and/or new rezoning policies to enable
the same.
CARRIED (Vote No. 04868)
(Councillors Hardwick and Kirby-Yung opposed)
(Councillor De Genova absent for the vote)
B. THAT Council direct staff to explore new possibilities for creating permanent
homes for low and moderate income families and individuals in all
neighbourhoods of the city, through the City Wide Plan as well as through
implementation of Housing Vancouver and the Affordable Housing Delivery and
Financial Strategy, including:
i. The City of Vancouver, through the Vancouver Affordable Housing
Endowment Fund (VAHEF), purchasing RS/RT properties to use for
Temporary Modular Housing, with potential future use for permanent
secure rental and non-market housing options;
ii. Consideration of the development of an Affordable Housing Land
Acquisition Strategy, which would include a study into annual
affordable housing land needs; estimated land costs; location
selection criteria, and an Affordable Housing Funding Strategy
including recommended levels of funding from taxation and new
development;
iii. Emerging possibilities for family-sized modular housing units; and
iv. Potential policy tools, including relaxing zoning and density by-laws to
allow as a conditional-use and/or streamlining approval processes, to
support social and non-market housing projects in all parts of the city
to make the development of affordable housing faster and less risky.

(Councillor De Genova absent for the vote)

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, September 11, 2019 14
MOVED by Councillor Fry
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS:
1. The Vancouver Rowing Club (VRC) was officially established in 1899, as an
offshoot of the Vancouver Boating Club (1886) and is the oldest amateur sports
organization in the city. With the exception of two World Wars, when all eligible
members volunteered to fight for Canada, the history of VRC and rowing in Coal
Harbour has been uninterrupted.
2. Since 1905 the VRC floating clubhouse has been located at Lot 14 Park Bridge
(described as “in Stanley Park, just past the bridge, below the bear pit.”).
Purpose built in 1911, the popular and picturesque Tudor-style floating clubhouse
known today was granted heritage ‘A’ status by Vancouver City Council in 1990.
3. VRC promotes active and healthy participation, with a constitutional mandate to
promote community building through amateur athletics. Membership is open to
the public, with members ranging in age from 13 to 90 years old.
4. VRC provides inclusive opportunities, with a para-athlete program and facilities to
enable wheelchair athletes to access the dock and row in Coal Harbour, and
popular “Learn to Row” courses to encourage the development of rowing in

5. Deterring and Preventing the Distribution and Sale of Psilocybin Mushrooms
and/or Other Illicit or Controlled Drugs Unlawfully Sold in the City of Vancouver
At the Regular Council meeting on July 23, 2019, Council referred the following motion to the
Standing Committee on Policy and Strategic Priorities meeting on September 11, 2019, to hear
from speakers, beginning at 3 pm. Subsequently, on September 11, 2019, the Committee
approved hearing from speakers, beginning at 6 pm.
The Committee heard from 13 speakers in opposition to the motion.
The City Manager responded to questions.
MOVED by Councillor De Genova
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. The Controlled Drugs and Substances Act categorizes Psilocin (3–
[2(dimethylamino)ethyl]–4–hydroxyindole) and any salt thereof AND Psilocybin
(3–[2–(dimethylamino)ethyl]–4–phosphoryloxyindole) and any salt thereof;
2. “Dirty Money” the report authored by Dr. Peter German Q.C., commissioned by
the provincial government states “The most lucrative crimes in Vancouver are
related to illegal drug sales. The drugs of choice cover the spectrum, from natural
products such as cannabis, cocaine and heroin, to chemical creations such as
opioids and hallucinogens. The purchasers are everyday residents of Vancouver
and are of every ethnicity, cultural heritage and gender.” (Page 37, section 122);
3. Dr. German also states in the “Dirty Money” report “Police sources indicate that
large quantities of illicit drug money also transit through Vancouver and are
related to Mexican drug cartels, including the Sinaloa and the CJNG.

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, September 11, 2019 22
Furthermore, Middle East Organized Crime (MEOC) is believed to have a strong
foothold in Vancouver and be working in concert with Mexican cartels. Fifteen
local crime groups provide transportation and other support services. The
involvement of home grown outlaw biker gangs in the illegal drug trade has been
documented for decades.”(Page 37, section 123);
4. In 2015, the City of Vancouver implemented amendments to the Zoning by-laws
to allow for Medical Marijuana Related Use (MMRU). Although many
dispensaries and compassion clubs applied and were successful in obtaining
Development Permits and opening dispensaries, no information on the source of
supply for these drugs was required. When the by-law passed, federal law
prohibited the sale of cannabis by dispensaries;
5. The City of Vancouver had difficulty with enforcement for dispensaries that
violated the conditions of the MMRU. Many dispensaries and stores operated
without a license, refusing to shut down;
6. Further, the dispensaries can only acquire their marijuana from illegal sources.
The Medicinal Mushroom Dispensary website states “We provide micro doses of
psilocybin mushrooms for medicinal purposes.” The website goes on to state
under the category of “Location” Serving all of Canada by Mail Order. We will be
opening a store front in Vancouver soon;
7. Psilocybin and psilocin compounds, and other substances included in the
Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA) are being studied for potential to
treat a variety of medical and psychological conditions, and any health benefits
are unsubstantiated. The Health Canada website titled “Psilocybin and psilocin
(“Magic Mushrooms”)” cautions “It is important to note that these studies
administered purified active ingredients, i.e. psilocybin, in clinically supervised
settings. Currently there are no approved therapeutic products containing
psilocybin in Canada”;
8. Listed on the government of Canada website, Problematic Substance Use and
Controlled and Illegal Drugs webpage, information states:
“Magic mushrooms may be sold as either dried whole mushrooms or as a
powder. People may choose to take the mushrooms as: eaten raw or cooked,
drunk as a tea or as a mixture with a fruit juice, sniffed up the nose (snorted)
when in a powder.
Psilocybin and psilocin can also be sold as a powder or in tablets or capsules
and can be produced in illegal labs. These active ingredients, psilocybin and
psilocin, can also be injected intravenously. The content of the drugs from illegal
labs is not tested and may contain other dangerous substances”;
9. A report to the Vancouver Police Board dated September 1, 2015 titled Service
and Policy Complaint #2015-112 regarding enforcement against states:
“Marihuana dispensaries are illegal; however, the issue of enforcement against
marihuana dispensaries is a complicated one because of intersecting legal,
social and political factors. The City of Vancouver (“the City”) has decided to
regulate rather than close all marijuana dispensaries using its by-law powers.”

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, September 11, 2019 23
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to engage and work with the
Vancouver Police Department, Vancouver Coastal Health and appropriate stakeholders
to address businesses and or dispensaries participating in the unlawful sale and/or
distribution of substances protected by the Controlled Substances and Drug Act (CSDA),
and report back with possible recommendations to Council, by the end of 2019, including
consideration for:
i. Any impact to public safety, including the City of Vancouver’s commitment to
deterring and preventing money laundering and criminal activity;
ii. Public health, including the impact and consequences of businesses promoting
unsubstantiated health benefits of potentially harmful substances;
iii. Potential implications to the City of Vancouver’s annual operating budget that
may result from not supporting rapid action to close and prevent businesses
participating in the sale of unlawful substances, listed in the CDSA.
