MOVED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
SECONDED by Councillor Boyle
WHEREAS on June 13, 2023, Council approved, in principle, amendments to
the Zoning and Development By-law and the Vancouver Building By-law to
simplify development permit requirements by transitioning rainwater
management requirements (the “Rainwater Management By-law
Amendments”);
WHEREAS Council also approved, in principle, consequential amendments to
the “Green Buildings Policy for Rezonings” and the “Rezoning Policy for
Sustainable Large Developments” (the “Consequential Policy Amendments”) to
be adopted by Council when the Rainwater Management By-law Amendments
are enacted;
AND WHEREAS the Rainwater Management By-law Amendments have been
enacted on July 25, 2023.

Council Meeting
Minutes, July 25, 2023 30
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council amends its various policies as
follows, effective July 25, 2023:
1. Council strikes Policy 1 in its entirety from the Green Buildings Policy for
Rezonings and renumbers the remaining policies consecutively.
2. In the Green Buildings Policy for Rezonings, Council strikes the Table of
Contents and replaces it as follows:
“Background and Context
Intent
Policies
1 Reporting of Green and Resilient Building Measures
1.1 Energy & Emissions Performance Limits
1.2 Embodied Carbon Limits
1.3 Resilient Buildings Planning Worksheet
2 Enhanced Commissioning
3 Energy System Sub-Metering
Requirement Administration
Heritage Buildings”
3. In the Rezoning Policy for Sustainable Large Developments, Council
strikes sections A.4.1.(i) and A.4.1.(j) and replaces them as follows:
“(i) A Soils Strategy (written and plans) with an accurate soil volume
overlay sheet to describe the area and type/quality of soils. This
should consider the site’s rainwater management strategy, soil
conservation practices, low impact construction practices, site
constraints, enhancement opportunities and landscape soil
standards.”.
4. In the Rezoning Policy for Sustainable Large Developments, Council
strikes section E and replaces it as follows:
“E. Groundwater Management
E.1 Objective
The proposal aims to preserve sewer capacity, reduce the risk of combined
sewer overflows and maintain wastewater treatment effectiveness through the
reduction of groundwater flows entering the sewer system in alignment with the
Metro Vancouver 2010 Integrated Liquid Waste and Resource Management
Plan.

Council Meeting
Minutes, July 25, 2023 31
E.2 Intent
City sewers are limited in their capacity and are not designed to convey
groundwater. Problems arise when developments such as those with deep
basements and/or underground parkades that intercept the water table
implement sub-drain systems that pump water to the sewer as a means to
intercept groundwater seepage and limit hydrostatic forces on foundation walls
and floor slabs. The intent of this policy is to prevent permanent groundwater
discharges to the City sewers. Accordingly, developments are required to
wholly manage groundwater onsite.
Definitions:
(i) Groundwater: Water occurring below the surface of the ground
within voids in a rock or soil matrix.
(ii) Water table: The level below which the soil or rock voids are
saturated with water at a pressure of 1 atmosphere or greater.
E.3 Requirements
E.3.1 All buildings and the site as a whole shall be designed such that no
groundwater from systems at or below the yearly high water table is
discharged to City sewers. Exceptions may be made for temporary
construction dewatering.
E.3.2 A Hydrogeological Study shall be undertaken at the site that evaluates
the potential for the proposed building(s) and site design to intercept the
yearly high water table. The study shall be prepared by a subject matter
expert, and include at minimum the items identified in the Groundwater
Management Bulletin. If any groundwater interception is proposed (post
construction), a Groundwater Management Plan must be submitted as
part of the Hydrogeological Study. The Groundwater Management Plan
will demonstrate that no permanent groundwater discharge to City
sewers will occur, and must include at a minimum the items identified in
the Groundwater Management Bulletin.
Note: If temporary construction dewatering is proposed, an Impact
Assessment must be submitted as part of the Hydrogeological Study.
The Impact Assessment will demonstrate that no significant negative
impacts result from groundwater extraction, and must include at a
minimum the items identified in the Groundwater Management Bulletin.
E.4 Submission Checklist
At time of rezoning application, applicants must provide the following to show
how items E.3.1 and E.3.2 will be achieved:
(a) Provide a preliminary Hydrogeological Study completed by a
professional with experience in hydrogeology as per the
specifications outlined in the Groundwater Management Bulletin.

Council Meeting
Minutes, July 25, 2023 32
(b) Geotechnical Study shall be undertaken at the site that evaluates
the potential and risks for onsite rainwater infiltration. The study
shall be prepared by a subject matter expert and registered
professional, and include at minimum:
(i) Infiltration testing at likely locations for infiltration practices
and a proposed design infiltration rate;
(ii) Soil stratigraphy;
(iii) Depth to bedrock and seasonally high groundwater; and
(iv) Assessment of infiltration risks such as slope stability and
soil contamination.
At time of development permit application, applicants must provide the following
to show how items E.3.1 and E.3.2 will be achieved:
(a) Provide a final signed and sealed Geotechnical Study prepared
by a subject matter expert and registered professional. The
content and supporting documentation is to be updated to reflect
all material changes to the proposed development and
new/refined supporting data, calculations, plans, reports and other
materials following submission of the preliminary Plan and
preliminary Geotechnical Study.
(b) Provide a final signed and sealed Hydrogeological Study,
including Groundwater Management Plan and Impact
Assessment, if applicable, completed by a certified professional
with experience in hydrogeology. The content and supporting
documentation is to be updated to reflect all material changes to
the proposed development and new/refined supporting data,
calculations, plans, reports and other materials following
submission of the preliminary Hydrogeological Study submitted at
time of Rezoning Application.”

2. Modernizing Mural and Signage By-laws to Support Local Businesses and a
Vibrant City
MOVED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
SECONDED By Councillor Zhou
WHEREAS
1. Storm Brewing was founded at 310 Commercial Drive in 1994 and has been a
beloved neighbourhood brewery for almost three decades;
2. Storm Brewing’s iconic mural has been a feature on the exterior wall of their
building for nearly ten years, providing an exciting and vibrant piece of mural art
that is beloved by locals and visitors alike;
3. During a recent routine patio inspection by City staff, the Storm Brewing mural
was identified as non-compliant for the first time;
4. The City’s by-law pertaining to murals (By-Law No. 6438) was enacted by
Council in 1988, is 35 years old, and does not reflect the contemporary appetite
for colourful neighbourhoods with creative installations;
5. The City’s sign by-law (By-law No. 11879) defines a “sign” as any visual medium
used to:
(a) attract attention or convey information of any kind by way of words,
numbers, pictures, graphics, logos or emblems;
(b) provide direction, information, identification or advertisement; or
(c) promote a product, business, activity, service or idea; including the
supporting structure, sign face, lighting fixtures and all other components,
but does not include light banding, a work of art or a mural approved by the City;
6. The City’s sign by-law states that a Sign in Conjunction with a Mural is a sign that
forms an integral part of the design of a mural that has been approved through a
development permit;

Council Meeting
Minutes, July 25, 2023 36
7. The City of Vancouver’s bylaws with regard to art and creativity in the public
realm should bolster rather than stifle or diminish expressions of art;
8. Murals and other public facing art installations can attract visitors to communities
to support local businesses and can help to discourage vandalism;
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to target a report back in early 2024 (with consideration
to other critical priority work underway to simplify permitting) with
recommendations for modernizing the sign and mural by-laws to allow for
commercial elements provided there is deemed to be a substantial component of
artistic expression and benefit to the public realm, and that the installation is
located on businesses’ own premises;
B. THAT as part of the report back staff consider proposed by-law amendments that
would allow the Storm Brewing mural to be grandfathered and allowed to stay in
place.
