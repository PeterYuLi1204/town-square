amended

portion of the Standing Committee on City Finance and Services meeting, immediately following

MOVED by Councillor Swanson
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. It is difficult to predict the timing of when speakers will present to Council at
Council and Standing Committee meetings as there are many variables which
impact the meeting length;
2. Some speakers scheduled to speak during Council and Standing Committee
meetings miss their turn on the speakers list due to this uncertainty;

Council
Minutes, January 22 and 28, 2020 4
3. People who have access to vehicles, internet and phone data, childcare, and
other privileges are therefore currently more likely to be able to speak to Council;
4. Some speakers who miss their turn may be able to speak to Council at the
conclusion of the speakers list for that particular agenda item;
5. The Procedure By-law does not specify that speakers who missed their turn
during Council and Standing Committee meetings should be given the
opportunity to be called to speak at the end of the speakers list.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to report back to Council with
proposed amendments to the Procedure By-law to specify that those speakers who are
registered on the speakers list for Council or Standing Committee meetings, and have
missed their turn to speak, should be given an opportunity to speak at the conclusion of
all other speakers on the registered list.

2. Election Finance: Transparent Funding in Local Politics
At the Council meeting on January 21, 2020, Council referred the following motion to the
Standing Committee on City Finance and Services meeting on January 22, 2020, in order to
hear from speakers.
The Committee referred debate and decision on the following motion to the reconvening Council
portion of the Standing Committee on City Finance and Services meeting, immediately following
the Public Hearing on Tuesday, January 28, 2020.
MOVED by Councillor Fry
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. Elections, election campaigns, referendums, and political operations should have
transparent and compliant contributor funding so elected officials are free from
real or perceived potential conflicts of interest, which undermine their duty to
represent the people they were elected to serve;
2. The federal and provincial levels of government have laws regarding political
financing which apply at all times and require that all political contributions be
made by individuals, that individuals have yearly contribution limits, and that
political parties must make annual public disclosures reporting received
contributions and their contributors;
3. In 2017 the B.C. legislature amended the Local Elections Campaign Financing
Act (LECFA), banning special interest and corporate political donations at the
local government level during an election year, placing limits on contributions and
mandating public disclosures. However, the LECFA only applies to electoral
organizations and candidates during an election year for the specific purpose of

Council
Minutes, January 22 and 28, 2020 5
campaigning, or the last 28 days before the election in the case of a third party
sponsor;
4. The LECFA does not regulate local electoral organizations in non-election years
or during an election year for their normal activities that are not part of their
election campaigns. Local electoral organizations have separate operating bank
accounts for these purposes and can accept unlimited donations from
corporations and special interests. The LECFA regulations do not require any
public disclosures of electoral organization operating bank accounts, nor do they
place maximum donation limits, or prevent corporations and special interests
from contributing to municipal political organizations;
5. Local Elector Organizations can have a significant impact and influence on local
politics, and on who becomes an elected official. This happens both during a
campaign and outside of campaign periods. Extending the LECFA contribution
restrictions, annual reporting and disclosure requirements, and including the
electoral organization operating account would create a level playing field for all
electoral organizations, improve transparency and limit contributions to compliant
BC residents only;
6. Third party sponsors can also have a significant impact and influence on local
politics and on who becomes an elected official or on a ballot question. In the
2018 Vancouver local election there were examples of significant unreported
third party spending prior to the election, which ended only 28 days before the
election, notwithstanding the intent of the LECFA;
7. The June 2019 City of Vancouver-convened volunteer-led Independent Election
Task Force on Campaign Finance Regulations 1 encouraged the City of
Vancouver to strongly urge the provincial government to improve upon the
existing campaign finance laws, along with specific recommendations:
7.1. To enhance transparency in campaign financing, require all donations to
candidates, elector organizations and third parties to be donated to a
centralized portal run by Elections BC with real time disclosure of
donations.
7.2. THAT the Independent Elections Task Force be reconvened to review the
following policy proposals, which have not previously been considered by
Council, and provide recommendations regarding: Appropriate regulation
of third-party groups wishing to engage on policy during municipal
elections; The suggestion that contributions to candidates running with
elector organizations to be in line with contributions to candidates running
as independents.;
8. The October 2019 Elections BC Report of the Chief Electoral Officer
2 recommendations on Improving Accessibility, Transparency and Compliance
included the following:
8.1. An elector organization is an organization that endorses or intends to
endorse a candidate in an election.

Council
Minutes, January 22 and 28, 2020 6
8.2. Require elector organizations to register with Elections BC and file annual
disclosure statements including reports of all financial transactions,
similar to those filed by provincial political parties. Maintain the
membership requirement (50 members) for elector organizations as
prescribed by s. 93(2)(a) of the Local Government Act.;
9. Political finance regulations are the cornerstone of responsible government.
Contribution limits and transparency requirements are necessary safeguards
which prevent corruption and undue influence and ensure accountability of
elected officials to the public.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council affirms a commitment to full and transparent reporting of financial
contributions to elector organizations and candidates both during a campaign
and outside of campaign periods, including contributions to operating expenses.
B. THAT Council reconvene the Independent Election Task Force, to review policy
questions laid out under the report’s Current Mandate proposal.
C. THAT Council direct staff to submit the following resolution along with the above
preamble (articles 3, 8) for consideration at the Lower Mainland Local
Government Association and/or working with other municipalities to present at
Union of BC Municipalities:
“Therefore be it resolved THAT the Union of BC Municipalities request that the
Province amend the Local Elections Campaign Financing Act to apply contributor
and contribution limits to operating accounts of elector organizations and
candidates for operational purposes at all times, and to require that they provide
annual disclosure reports of contributions received in operating bank accounts, in
election years and non-election years;
FURTHER THAT Third Party Sponsors be required to provide disclosure reports
for the full election year or the date that a referendum is announced, whichever is
later.”
