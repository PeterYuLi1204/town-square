COUNCIL MEMBERS’ MOTIONS
1. Promoting Cultural Inclusion and Economic Vitality: Advancing the Main Street
Filipino Cultural Centre and Hotel Project
At the Standing Committee on Policy and Strategic Priorities meeting on November 26, 2025,
Mayor Sim moved and introduced his motion “Promoting Cultural Inclusion and Economic
Vitality: Advancing the Main Street Filipino Cultural Centre and Hotel Project” and was seconded
by Councillor Zhou. The Committee completed hearing from registered speakers for the motion
and proceeded to debate. During debate, the Committee referred the motion to the Standing
Committee on City Finance and Services meeting on December 10, 2025.
MOVED by Mayor Sim
SECONDED by Councillor Zhou
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, December 10, 2025 17
1. The City of Vancouver has prioritized inclusive cultural infrastructure, economic
resilience, and tourism growth through recent strategic documents, including the
Vancouver Plan, the Broadway Plan, and the Economic Development Strategy;
2. The Filipino Canadian community is one of Canada’s largest and most dynamic
diasporas and has long sought a permanent cultural home in Vancouver to
reflect its heritage, identity, and contributions to the City;
3. In June 2023, Vancouver City Council unanimously endorsed a motion entitled
“Support for the Filipino Cultural Centre in Vancouver Campaign” (Vote No.
09335), affirming Council’s support for a Filipino Cultural Centre to serve British
Columbia’s Filipino community. The motion recognized the Centre’s value in
enabling local cultural celebrations and performances, and in helping younger
generations of Filipino Canadians born in Canada remain connected to their
roots. The motion also endorsed Vancouver as a desirable location for such a
centre;
4. The Filipino Legacy Society of Canada has formally been registered under the
provincial Societies Act for the purpose of coordinating and advancing efforts of
the Filipino community toward the establishment of a Filipino Cultural Centre, and
will work in coordination with organizations such as, but not limited to, the United
Filipino Canadian Associations in BC (UFCABC), the Filipino Seniors Club of
British Columbia (FSCBC), the Filipino Seniors Club of British Columbia
(FSCBC), Cebuano Society of Canada, Diversity and Inclusion Support Group of
BC, and the Seniors Intercultural Society of BC; 1
5. A preliminary proposal has now been brought forward, by PortLiving, for a Main
Street Filipino Cultural Centre and dual-tower hotel development that spans two
sites in the Mount Pleasant neighbourhood, 1940 Main Street and 143 East 3rd
Avenue, both of which are situated within a 5-minute walk of the future Mount
Pleasant Broadway Line station;
6. The preliminary proposal includes:
• A Filipino Canadian Cultural Centre, offering language and cooking
classes, event and gallery space, and the largest Filipino art collection
outside the Philippines;
• A dedicated heritage landmark commemorating and honouring Filipino
history and culture;
• 500 much-needed hotel rooms through two internationally affiliated brands
serving both traditional and extended-stay visitors;
1 Additional Organizations include but are not limited to: One Filipino Cooperative of BC, Fil Cooperative One Housing Society, Fil-
Can Cultural Heritage Society, North Peace Fil-Can Community Bayanihan Assn, Global Multicultural Affairs Society Canada,
Philippine Bagong Pag-Asa of BC, Burnaby Filipino Cultural Society, Dimisilang III International Artist Group, True North Hinirang
Eagles Club.

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, December 10, 2025 18
• Residential-style hotel suites close to St. Paul’s and Vancouver General
Hospitals to support visiting families and long-stay patients; and
• A privately funded model, with a Letter of Intent in place with an
internationally affiliated brand and no anticipated requirement for City funding;
7. The project presents unique economic development and tourism benefits,
consistent with the Broadway Plan’s intent to strengthen Mount Pleasant Centre
as a vibrant, transit-connected, mixed-use hub for jobs, housing, culture, and
amenities;
8. The project aligns with multiple City priorities, including:
• Delivering cultural and community infrastructure without the use of City funds;
• Increasing hotel supply and diversity amid a growing accommodation
shortage;
• Advancing Reconciliation and UNDRIP goals through partnerships rooted in
respect, healing, and inclusion;
• Supporting Mount Pleasant’s multicultural identity, where Tagalog is among
the most spoken languages; and
• Strengthening Vancouver’s position as a global cultural and convention
destination;
9. The time-sensitive nature of this hotel project proposal, as per the Letter of Intent
with the internationally affiliated brand, necessitates prompt action by having this
proposal reviewed as a priority by Staff based upon this rare convergence of
opportunity, community alignment, and private-sector commitment; and
10. While one of the towers may impact the Main Street view cone, options exist to
explore amendments to the view cone and massing adjustments through a
review process that recognizes the proposal as a priority project with citywide
benefits.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to prioritize the review of the proposed Main Street
Filipino Cultural Centre and Hotel project across the two sites at 1940 Main
Street and 143 East 3rd Avenue, as well as any recommended amendments to
the Main Street view cone, given its significant cultural, social, economic, and
tourism merits, as well as the time-sensitivity of the proposal.
B. THAT staff be directed to work with the applicant to refine the proposal in a
manner that:

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, December 10, 2025 19
• Respects key view cone objectives to the extent feasible, including
options for re-massing or podium redesign;
• Ensures high-quality urban design and public realm integration,
consistent with the Broadway Plan and Design Guidelines;
• Maintains the applicant’s commitment to deliver the Filipino Cultural
Centre at no cost to the City; and
• Secures the construction and delivery of the Filipino Cultural Centre on
the proposed lands as part of any future rezoning application that may be
brought forward to Council for its consideration.
C. THAT staff be directed to process and prioritize any application for rezoning and
report back on progress no later than Q1 2026, and to bring the application
forward to the earliest available Public Hearing for Council’s consideration and
deliberation.
D. THAT Council direct the General Manager of Planning, Urban Design and
Sustainability to engage with the applicant, and other cultural stakeholders to
ensure the Centre’s programming, governance, and design reflect the values of
inclusivity, authenticity, and intergenerational connection.
E. THAT Council direct staff to work with Filipino stakeholders, such as, the Filipino
Legacy Society of Canada to identify a suitable City-owned or City-controlled
property for use as an interim community space, and report back to Council on a
potential location that may be leased to the Filipino Legacy Society at a nominal
lease rate, subject to Council approval of such a lease as a grant.
F. THAT Council direct staff to work in partnership with the Mayor’s Office and the
Filipino Legacy Society of Canada in coordination with other organizations such
as, but not limited to, the National Pilipino Canadian Cultural Centre (NPC3), the
United Filipino Canadian Associations in BC (UFCABC), and the Filipino Seniors
Club of British Columbia (FSCBC), to assemble a transitional working group to
assist with the development of a governance and programming framework for the
Filipino Cultural Centre;
FURTHER THAT the existing agreement between the Filipino Legacy Society
and the project proponent will be disclosed to the transitional working group on a
confidential basis.

2. Cementing the City of Vancouver’s Support for Pride Weekend
The Committee heard from four speakers who spoke in support of the motion.

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, December 10, 2025 22
MOVED by Councillor Meiszner
SECONDED by Councillor Dominato
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. The Vancouver Pride Society (VPS) is a long-standing cultural partner of the City
of Vancouver, producing the annual Pride Parade, Festival, and related
community programming that celebrate and support Vancouver’s 2SLGBTQIA+
communities;
2. The City’s 2SLGBTQIA+ Advisory Committee, at its November 13, 2025 meeting,
passed a motion reaffirming the importance of continued municipal support for
VPS during a period of increased financial strain, and encouraged Council to act
in alignment with this longstanding commitment;
3. Council has consistently supported VPS’s events and cultural programming,
including through annual cultural project grants, financial offsets under the City’s
Special Event Framework, and through public safety and operational
coordination that enable VPS to deliver large-scale, accessible events such as
the Pride Parade and Pride Festival;
4. VPS has received cultural project grants of $7,500 to $10,000 every year for over
20 years (available records go back to 2003), and in most years has received two
or more grants supporting summer and winter Pride initiatives;
5. Since 2020, VPS has received a total of $99,700 across nine grants, supporting
seven cultural projects (including summer and winter Pride celebrations), one
Cultural Learning and Sharing Grant, and one Cultural Spaces Grant;
6. The City, through its Film & Special Events Branch, works closely with the
Vancouver Pride Society (VPS) and the West End BIA to support the successful
permitting and delivery of both the Pride Parade and the Davie Village Block
Party, including the coordination of public safety and operational requirements
that help sustain Pride programming drawing hundreds of thousands of residents
and visitors each summer;
7. Under the City’s Special Event Framework, both events receive substantial
financial support: the City provides 100% coverage of City-incurred public safety
costs and, through the Festshare program, covers 75% of other City and VPD
operational charges, representing the most significant form of municipal financial
assistance provided to VPS;
8. In 2025, the Pride Parade incurred $98,681.44 in City and VPD costs but, after
Festshare and public safety support were applied, VPS paid only $17,550.27,
with the remaining $81,131.17 covered by the City; similarly, the Davie Village
Block Party incurred $71,602.77 in City and VPD costs but organizers were
charged only $14,299.02 after the program was applied, with the remaining
$57,303.75 covered by the City;

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, December 10, 2025 23
9. The Davie Village Block Party – led by the West End BIA, VPS, and QMUNITY –
was successfully reintroduced in 2025 through the Council-endorsed motion from
Councillor Meiszner entitled “Bringing Back the Block Party: Supporting Davie
Village and Vancouver Pride Celebrations,” and its return helped strengthen
community connection, support local businesses, and enhance Pride Weekend
programming; and
10. At the Vancouver City Council meeting of July 9, 2025, Mayor and Council
pledged to find ways to financially support the Vancouver Pride Society at a time
when VPS is facing substantial shortfalls in corporate sponsorships.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT
A. THAT Council reaffirm its ongoing support for the Vancouver Pride Society,
including the annual Pride Parade, Pride Festival, and related community
programming, and direct staff to continue providing cultural grants, special event
support, and public safety cost offsets in accordance with established City
policies;
FURTHER THAT staff be directed to report back in Q1 2026 with an update on
supports provided to VPS and any recommended adjustments to strengthen the
City’s long-term partnership with the Vancouver Pride Society.
B. THAT Council affirm its continued support for the Davie Street Block Party, and
direct staff to work with VPS and community partners including the West End BIA
and QMUNITY, to facilitate the event in 2026 and in subsequent years, subject to
permitting and public safety requirements.

WHEREAS

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, December 10, 2025 24
1. In April 2025, Council unanimously supported the establishment of the Vancouver
Business Growth Task Force to respond to the significant and escalating
economic challenges facing Vancouver and to position the city as on of the most
competitive jurisdictions in North America to start, grow, and scale a business.
This mandate includes recommending immediate and medium-term changes to
City processes that directly impact business competitiveness;
2. The Task Force brings together leaders from technology, finance, tourism, clean
energy, real estate, hospitality, trade, creative industries, and education (sectors
that collectively anchor Vancouver’s economy) to identify the systemic barriers
that restrict business growth and to develop practical, evidence-based actions
the City can take to reduce red tape, improve regulatory predictability, and
support job creation;
3. Vancouver’s business environment is under mounting pressure from rising
operating costs, supply-chain disruptions, workforce challenges, public-safety
concerns, and increased tariff impacts that are placing a strain on small, medium,
and large employers across the city;
4. Family-supporting businesses of all sizes across Vancouver are urgently
advocating to all orders of government for emergency measures to support their
operations and long-term viability;
5. The Red Tape Reform Subcommittee of the Task Force has identified a series of
priority actions the City can undertake in the near term to address long-standing
permitting, licensing, and regulatory challenges. These changes would provide
near-term relief for businesses through 2026 and help strengthen Vancouver’s
economic readiness ahead of the FIFA World Cup; and
6. The Economic Development Subcommittee will be finalizing additional
recommendations in the coming months.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to implement the following
recommendations of the Vancouver Business Growth Task Force without delay:
A. Digitize and streamline all business-related permits, including those in the film
sector, to reduce processing times, improve clarity, and enhance the overall user
experience;
B. Align all business-related permit renewal dates with business licence renewal
cycles to simplify requirements and reduce administrative burden;
C. Modernize and accelerate liquor licensing by fast tracking liquor licence
renewals, and eliminate all study requirements that duplicate existing provincial
requirements;
D. Create a simplified, rapid short-term activation and pop-up approval pathway
(where no life-safety issues exist) to encourage programming and animation of
sidewalks, plazas, and other public spaces;

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, December 10, 2025 25
E. Expand the Temporary Occupancy Permit Pilot city-wide in advance of the FIFA
World Cup to activate vacant spaces and bolster neighbourhood business
vibrancy;
F. Establish a Small Business Navigator with a fast-track option for established
businesses, providing a single point of contact and "front-counter" support to help
businesses navigate City processes, permits, and services more efficiently;
G. Develop plain-language toolkits for common business licence types, clearly
outlining steps, fees, timelines, and required approvals;
H. Include a “Business Implications” section in all Council staff reports to increase
transparency regarding how proposed decisions may affect local businesses;
I. Adopt an Education-First Compliance Model for all business-related permits
where life safety is not affected to ensure a collaborative, problem-solving
approach.

The Committee heard from 13 speakers who spoke in support and three speakers who spoke in
opposition to the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Maloney
SECONDED by Councillor Orr
THAT the Committee recommend to Council

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, December 10, 2025 26
WHEREAS
1. In British Columbia, drivers are permitted to turn right on a red light, provided it's
safe and a sign doesn't explicitly prohibit it. Drivers are required to come to a
complete stop first and yield to pedestrians, cyclists, and other vehicles before
proceeding (Section 129(3) of the Motor Vehicle Act);
2. Vancouver has a program of implementing Leading Pedestrian Intervals, which
provide pedestrians a three to seven second head start when entering an
intersection with a green signal in the same direction of travel. Leading
pedestrian intervals improve the visibility of pedestrians and reinforce their right-
of-way over turning vehicles, especially in locations with a history of conflict (City
of Vancouver);
3. The safety benefits of implementing a Leading Pedestrian Interval are
undermined by allowing drivers to turn right on a red light across the path of
pedestrians taking advantage of the head start provided by the Leading
Pedestrian Interval;
4. Right-turning on red is dangerous to all road users, increasing all right-turning
crashes by 23 percent, pedestrian collisions by 60 percent, and cyclist collisions
by 100 percent (Zador, 1984);
5. A 2015 Toronto Public Health study found that between 2008 and 2012, right
turning cars striking a pedestrian who had the right of way were responsible for
1,235 injuries and fatalities, accounting for 12 percent of all road injuries in
Toronto, a crash-type largely attributable to drivers turning right on red (Toronto
Public Health, 2015);
6. The City of Vancouver’s Pedestrian Safety Study found that “collisions involving
right-turning vehicles are the second most common type of pedestrian collision”,
and recommended restricting right turn on red at intersections where it is
common because “most of these collisions occur at signalized intersections when
the pedestrian is crossing with the walk signal” (City of Vancouver, 2012);
7. The B.C. Community Road Safety Toolkit created by the Ministry of Public Safety
and Solicitor General identifies restricting right turn on red as an effective
measure to protect all road users at intersections (Government of British
Columbia, 2018);
8. Right turn on red was originally introduced as a fuel efficiency measure, though
recent research suggests that it often results in higher emissions due to excess
acceleration and that any benefits are increasingly negated by the adoption of
electric vehicles (Appleyard et al., 2024);
9. Right turn on red is prohibited in the Island of Montreal, New York City, and
Washington, D.C., and in the latter case saw a 97 percent reduction in vehicle-to-
vehicle conflict and a 92 percent reduction in failure to yield to pedestrians during
a 2018 pilot project (Wolfgram et al., 2022);

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, December 10, 2025 27
10. Since 2023, the City of Seattle has required right turn on red restrictions at all
new and upgraded signalized intersections installed within the City (Seattle
Department of Transportation, 2023); and
11. A 2015 City of Vancouver study found that around 13 percent of cyclist-driver
collisions occur on a right turn and identified prohibiting right turn on red at
locations with high cycling volumes as a potential safety measure (City of
Vancouver, 2015).
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council directs staff to explore and report back
on improving the safety of intersections in Vancouver by:
A. Restricting right turn on red movements across all intersections where a leading
pedestrian interval will be or has been installed.
B. Restricting right turn on red movements across all intersections where a right turn
movement conflicts with a bicycle lane, cycle track, greenway, multi-use path, or
other cycling facility.
C. Implementing right turn on red restrictions at existing full-signalized intersections
with an elevated rate of pedestrian and cyclist injuries where such a restriction
does not already exist.
D. Working with TransLink to secure agreement to implement right turn on red
restrictions at any intersection to which A, B, or C above apply, that overlaps with
the Major Road Network.

SECONDED by Councillor Dominato

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, December 10, 2025 28
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. Uplifting Chinatown, passed unanimously by City Council in January 2023 aimed
to support economic vitality and address deteriorating conditions in Vancouver’s
historic Chinatown. One of the three pillars to the action plan, Community
Supports, emphasized continuation of existing programs that provide supports to
people in Chinatown;
2. Located at 418 Main Street, The Chinatown Post Office has served as a vital
community hub for residents, businesses, and seniors in Vancouver’s historic
Chinatown and the DTES area for decades. The privately owned franchise
operation permanently shuttered the service on November 12;
3. Canada Post has been reported as saying the closure was part of a broader
review of retail operations to reduce costs, and Canada Post chose not to
maintain or replace the franchisee2;
4. Access to postal services is essential for local businesses, unhoused and low-
income people, seniors, and people with disabilities, and residents who rely on
in-person services for mail, parcels, and financial transactions;
5. Many service recipients in Chinatown have no mail receptacle (or what Canada
Post refer to as a Secure Location / Safe Drop), meaning that many residents will
be diverted to as far away as 499 Granville or 1424 Commercial Drive to collect
mail and parcels;
6. Chinatown is a designated historic neighborhood and cultural heritage site, and
maintaining essential services like a post office supports its economic vitality and
cultural preservation; and
7. The closure and reduction of services at the Chinatown Post Office
disproportionately impacts seniors, small businesses, and residents with limited
mobility or digital access.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT
A. THAT The City of Vancouver formally express its support for the continued
operation of a Chinatown Post Office as a full-service facility;
B. THAT Council request that the Mayor write to:

7. Supporting a Fare-Free Transit Route Pilot in Vancouver
The Committee heard from eight speakers who spoke in support of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Orr
SECONDED by Councillor Fry
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. The cost of transit fares can pose a barrier to mobility for low-income individuals,
seniors, and families in Vancouver, limiting their access to employment,
education, health care, and other essential services;
2. In January 2019, Vancouver City Council endorsed the #AllOnBoard campaign,
which urged TransLink to implement free transit for youth and a sliding-scale fare
system for low-income residents, underscoring the City’s commitment to
improving transit affordability and equity;
3. Improving transit affordability and access supports the City’s climate and
transportation goals by encouraging a shift from private vehicles to public transit,
thereby reducing greenhouse gas emissions and traffic congestion;
4. New York City ran a successful free transit pilot from September of 2023 until
September of 2024, targeting five bus routes, one in each borough. The results
of the pilot were very positive:
a. A 30 percent increase in ridership on weekdays and 38 percent on
weekends;
b. Assaults on bus operators dropped by 38.9 percent;
c. 11% of new riders transitioned from car or taxi to public transit;
d. The largest increase in new riders was from individuals earning less than
$28,000;
5. Fare-free pilots based on route have been implemented in Kansas City, MO, and
Boston, MA, and fare-free bus systems have been successfully implemented in
Olympia, WA, Albuquerque, NM, Richmond, VA, Orangeville, ON, Luxembourg,
and elsewhere;

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, December 10, 2025 33
6. Several major bus routes in Vancouver, including Route 3 (Main Street), Route 9
(Broadway), Route 20 (Victoria Drive), and Route 41 (41st Avenue), are well
used, serve diverse communities (including many lower-income neighborhoods),
and are iconic parts of the transit network. These routes’ popularity and citywide
significance make them strong candidates for a high-visibility fare-free transit
pilot that could maximize public awareness and ridership impact; and
7. TransLink (the regional transportation authority) is responsible for transit
operations and fare policy in Metro Vancouver, and any fare-free transit initiative
within the city will require collaboration with TransLink to design and implement
the pilot effectively.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Vancouver City Council direct staff to seek to work with TransLink to
identify and evaluate options for implementing a one year fare-free transit pilot on
two or three bus routes or corridors across the City of Vancouver, including
consideration of, but not limited to, Route 5 (Robson Street), Route 9
(Broadway), Route 20 (Victoria Drive), and Route 41 (41st Avenue).
B. THAT in evaluating potential routes for the fare-free pilot, staff consider criteria
aimed at maximizing public benefit and feasibility, including:
1. Equity Impact - prioritizing routes that would provide the greatest benefit
to lower-income residents, seniors, and families by improving access to
affordable transportation in their daily lives;
2. Symbolic and Popular Routes - focusing on routes that are iconic or
heavily used in Vancouver’s transit network (such as the 5, the 20, the 9,
and the 41) in order to generate broad public interest, support, and
awareness of the pilot;
3. Capacity and Congestion Relief - identification of routes that have
available unused capacity even during peak hours, and proposals for
routes that have the potential to divert some riders from overcrowded
routes into alternatives, thereby relieving peak-time congestion;
4. Geographic distribution - the recommendation of complimentary routes
that service different areas of the city, sharing the benefits of fare-free
transit.
C. THAT Council directs staff to request from TransLink cost estimates for each
fare-free pilot scenario identified, including the expected lost fare revenue and
any additional operating or administrative costs, in order to understand the
financial implications of implementing a fare-free route or corridor on a pilot
basis.
D. THAT staff be directed to inquire with TransLink whether the agency would be
willing to participate in a cost-sharing arrangement to support any of the
proposed fare-free pilot routes or corridors, such as through a contribution of

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, December 10, 2025 34
transit operating funds or other resources, and to incorporate TransLink’s position
on fare-free transit routes and potential cost-sharing in the analysis and options
presented.
E. THAT Council request that the Mayor write a letter to the Province to strongly
advocate for a partnership to advance a temporary pilot program for fare-free
transit routes across Vancouver and the Lower Mainland.
F. THAT staff report back to Council with the results of the above evaluation and
collaboration, including options for recommended route(s) for the fare-free transit
pilot, the estimated revenue loss and other costs associated with each option,
and any opportunities for partnership or funding support from TransLink by Q2 of
2026 in order for Council to consider next steps toward implementing the fare-
free transit route pilot in Vancouver.

(Councillors Kirby-Yung, Klassen, Meiszner, Montague, Zhou and Mayor Sim opposed)
(Councillors Bligh and Dominato absent for the vote)
8. Assessing Motor Vehicle Speeding Risk at Vancouver's Most Dangerous
Intersections
The Committee heard from three speakers in support of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Orr
SECONDED by Councillor Fry
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. The City of Vancouver has a stated goal to have zero traffic related fatalities and
serious injuries. Even one fatality is too many;
2. Although progress has been made toward zero traffic-related fatalities and
serious injuries, more work needs to be done given the fact that fatalities and
serious injuries still occur;
3. At present, there are around 15 fatal road crashes in the City of Vancouver every
year;
4. Many factors contribute to some intersections having more dangerous crashes
than others;
5. ICBC reports that speed is the largest contributing factor of crashes in BC;
6. Speed is a very important factor in crashes, with higher speeds resulting in more
frequent and more severe crashes. Larger deviations in speed also result in more
frequent crashes;

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, December 10, 2025 35
7. The City of Vancouver does not regularly record speeds on arterial roads, where
most fatal crashes occur. Wherever the City does record speeds, many drivers
are observed to be exceeding the speed limit. Speed data is recorded with
autonomous pole-mounted battery-powered radar units;
8. Collecting speed data is within the City’s jurisdiction, and external parties that
wish to collect speed data within the City must liaise with City staff. There is
minimal data currently available to inform recommendations from Provincial
Public Health researchers as to the speeds of vehicles currently on the road; and
9. When a clear pattern of drivers exceeding posted speed limits has been shown,
street infrastructure can be modified at low cost to help reduce vehicle speeds.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council directs staff to develop and implement a program led by the City’s
transportation safety division to collect speed data at the sites of all road
fatalities, recording data for a target of 20 sites each year until the queue is
completed.
B. THAT fatalities from more recent years be prioritized in the queue.
C. THAT speed data be recorded for a target of 168 hours at each location, and a
minimum of 48 hours.
D. THAT speed data be recorded at the anniversary of the fatality, when possible.
E. THAT initial funding for this program be requested from the Province’s $20,000
Vision Zero BC grant, potentially to purchase a pole-mounted radar unit, or pay
city staff, or pay contractors.
