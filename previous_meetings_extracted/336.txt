required for the City’s Anti-Racism Strategy. He enquired if Council could have an updated
memo regarding future progress, milestones, and the future status to continue advancing the
Anti-Racism Strategy in the city of Vancouver. The City Manager agreed to provide Council with
a memo and also provide some background information on the challenges the Social Policy
team has been dealing with, and why the strategy has not advanced as much as last year.

noted staff are contemplating a number of changes and he will provide that feedback to Council.

Manager agreed to share the comment with staff, however, he advised, that at this stage staff
believe it is too early to say it is not possible to make this work.
