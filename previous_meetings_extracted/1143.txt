SECONDED by Councillor Meggs
WHEREAS
1. Vancouver currently has License By-law No. 4450 that allows for the sale of
cats, dogs and rabbits from commercial breeding facilities;
2. It has been shown that commercial breeding facilities can raise animals in
horrible conditions resulting in neglect, abuse and suffering;

often suffer from disease, and other physical, emotional and behaviour
problems;
4. The City of Richmond has passed by-laws restricting the sale of dogs (2010)
and rabbits (2009), the City of New Westminster has passed a by-law restricting
the sale of cats, dogs and rabbits (2012) within their municipalities;
5. Other municipalities across Canada have passed by-laws restricting the sale of
cats, dogs and rabbits;
6. Many members of the public have contacted Vancouver City Council expressing
concern over the sale of cats, dogs and rabbits within the city and request that
the City of Vancouver take action;
7. Potential pet owners still have the option of obtaining a cat, dog or rabbit
directly through reputable breeders and through recognized animal rescue and
shelter organizations.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT staff put forward amendments to the License By-law
No. 4450 to prohibit the sale of cats, dogs and rabbits in a pet store or other type of
retail premises with the exception of those animals offered for adoption from a
recognized animal rescue society or shelter organization.

for the creation of a cost-shared Universal Healthy School Food Program that
will enable all students in Canada to have access to healthy meals at school,
serving culturally appropriate, local, sustainable food to the fullest extent
possible.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT the Union of BC Municipalities (UBCM) and
Federation of Canadian Municipalities (FCM) advocate for a Universal Healthy School
