B. Motions on Notice
1. Transparency in Financial Disclosure by Members of Council
MOVED by Councillor Reimer
SECONDED by Councillor Jang
WHEREAS
1. The public has an increasing interest in greater transparency in government
and the City of Vancouver has been at the forefront of efforts to increase
access to information, including establishing the first open data policy for a
major city in Canada;
2. The financial interests of members of Council are currently disclosed under the
provincial Financial Disclosure Act;
3. The province of British Columbia states on the government website that "The
intent of the Financial Disclosure Act is to identify what areas of influence and
possible financial benefit an elected official, nominee or designated employee
might have by virtue of their office, and to ensure the public has reasonable
access to the information.";
4. On a number of occasions some Councillors have referenced employment
relationships or declared conflicts with corporate entities not listed on their
Statement of Financial Disclosure;
5. Recently a Councillor stated they would donate 100% of their publicly funded
salary to charity indicating they receive substantial personal financial benefit
from private interests but the exact interests are unclear due to the nature of
their external employment;
6. These undisclosed conflicts appear to exist as a result of Councillors who work
as lobbyists or government and public relation consultants on behalf of other
corporate interests.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council request staff to provide a mechanism for
members of the public to have access to information on potential conflicts of interest
for members of Council who list as sources of income public relations firms,
government relations firms, consultancies, holding companies of other entities which
obscure pecuniary interest.
referred

REFERRAL MOVED by Councillor Jang
SECONDED by Councillor Carr

CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY (Vote No. 02235)
2. Accelerating Adoption of Electric Vehicles by Requiring More Charging Stations in
Multi-Family Buildings
MOVED by Councillor Carr
SECONDED by Councillor De Genova
WHEREAS
1. The City of Vancouver’s Renewable City Strategy Update of November 1, 2017,
notes that the city reduced Greenhouse Gas emissions (GhGs) over 2007 levels
by only 11 percent by 2016 despite the Greenest City Action Plan goal of a 33
percent reduction by 2020, but can meet that goal by 2023 and be on target to
be carbon-free by 2050 if we accelerate the pace of progress;
2. Transportation, almost entirely dependent on fossil fuels, currently accounts
for 41 percent of Vancouver’s GhGs;
3. As electric-vehicle (EV) technology, vehicle availability and consumer interest
in EVs surge, it is incumbent on the City of Vancouver to ensure there is
sufficient EV charging infrastructure to support city-wide adoption of EVs;
4. Vancouver’s Building By-law currently requires only 20 percent of parking stalls
to have an EV charging station.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to bring forward changes in the
next update of the Vancouver Building By-law to require every parking stall in
multi-family dwellings to have an EV charging station.
