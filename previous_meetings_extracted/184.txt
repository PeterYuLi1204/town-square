MOVED by Councillor Montague
SECONDED by Councillor Zhou
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. Vancouver's annual Remembrance Day ceremony at Victory Square is a revered
city tradition and deeply ingrained in Vancouver's cultural fabric. It is the oldest
continuing annual ceremony in the city and attracts thousands of people, rain or
shine;
2. The act of Remembrance is one of the most important ways to honour and thank
Veterans for their sacrifices and to ensure that Canada never forgets the
sacrifices of our Armed Forces, RCMP, Peace Officers, Merchant Navy, and
Reserves;

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, October 09, 2024 5
3. We also remember Canada’s military families on Remembrance Day – the
mothers, fathers, sons, and daughters of Canadian Veterans – who greatly
appreciate this annual day of observance;
4. Vancouver’s solemn Remembrance Day ceremony includes the “Last Post” and
the “Lament” as well as a fly-past, the change of the guard, wreath-laying, and a
parade of veterans, military units, cadets, police, brass bands, pipes, and drums;
5. The City of Vancouver has the unique distinction of being the only city in Canada
that supports a civic volunteer committee – the Vancouver Remembrance Day
Committee. The Remembrance Day Committee diligently and unfailingly serves
to organize and conduct the annual November 11th ceremony and ensures that
the legacy of our veterans is honoured by the people of our city and beyond;
6. This year, Vancouver's Remembrance Day ceremony is particularly significant as
it will be the 100th anniversary of the Cenotaph, Metro Vancouver's primary
monument commemorating the valor and sacrifices of the Canadian Armed
Forces' veterans;
7. The Cenotaph stands as a symbol of our collective memory and gratitude
towards those who have served our nation, which it has done since its inception
in 1924 following the City of Vancouver's acquisition of Victory Square in 1917;
8. To mark the Cenotaph centennial this year, a collaborative effort between
volunteers, i.e., the Legion's BC/Yukon Command and ANAVETS BC Command,
has given rise to the "Victory Square 100" project which aims to commemorate
our veterans' heroism in a distinctive and memorable manner;
9. A key feature of the "Victory Square 100" project is the installation of banners
adorned with photographs of veterans. These banners will be prominently
displayed on street lamp posts along major thoroughfares in the city, with a
special focus on Victory Square and the Chinatown Memorial Square. This visual
homage will not only enhance the cityscape but will also serve as a constant
reminder of the bravery and sacrifices of our veterans to residents and visitors
alike;
10. Following the Victory Square ceremony, many dignitaries participate in a
remembrance ceremony held at Chinatown’s Memorial Square. The ANAVETS
Pacific Unit # 280 has therefore proposed to put up additional banners in
Chinatown to honour Chinese Canadian veterans who fought for Canada in both
World Wars and other conflicts where Chinese Canadians also served;
11. The valiant contributions of Chinese Canadian veterans stand alongside the long,
proud tradition of military service to our country by Indigenous peoples (First
Nations, Inuit and Métis people), as well as Japanese, Sikh, and other diverse
groups that have been instrumental in our nation's military efforts during times of
war. Their sacrifices and dedication are a testament to the strength and
resilience of Canada’s multicultural fabric;

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, October 09, 2024 6
12. In order to help bring the Victory Square Banner vision to life and ensure that the
program is executed with the dignity and respect it deserves, The Vancouver
Remembrance Day Committee has requested a $15,000 grant from the City
(nominally divided into a $10,000 grant to the Legion and a $5,000 grant to the
ANAVETS for the Chinatown initiative);
13. By supporting additional "Victory Square 100" banners in Chinatown, we not only
recognize the valour, sacrifices, and military service of Chinese Canadians
during both World Wars and in other conflicts, we also acknowledge the pivotal
role Chinese Canadian veterans played in our nation's history. Their contributions
not only secured citizenship and voting rights for Chinese Canadians, they also
paved the way for equal professional opportunities in sectors previously closed to
them such as law, engineering, and medicine;
14. The "Victory Square Banner Program" is a fitting tribute to our veterans and a
testament to Vancouver's commitment to honouring our history and those who
have shaped it; and
15. Under Section 206(1)(j) of the Vancouver Charter, Council has the authority to
deem any organization that is to receive a grant, which is not a registered charity
with Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), to be an organization contributing to the
health or welfare of the City.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT in recognition of our veterans in this centennial year of the Victory Square
Cenotaph, Council direct staff to apply one-time grants to offset costs related to
the banner installation, including rental fees for the Royal Canadian Legion,
BC/Yukon Command and the ANAVETS Pacific Unit #280’s Remembrance Day
commemorations.
B. THAT Council approve one-time grants of $10,000 to the Royal Canadian
Legion, BC/Yukon Command and $5,000 to the ANAVETS Pacific Unit #280 to
offset costs related to the banner installation, including rental fees. The funding
source for these one-time grants is the Engineering Services operating budget.
C. THAT pursuant to Section 206(1)(j) of the Vancouver Charter, Council deems
any organization that is not a charity registered with the Canada Revenue
Agency, and that is to receive a grant pursuant to this motion, to be an
organization contributing to the culture or welfare of the city.
D. THAT Council authorize the General Manager, Engineering Services to negotiate
and execute agreements or documents to support the grants described in this
motion on terms and conditions as are satisfactory to the General Manager,
Engineering Services and the Director of Legal Services.

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, October 09, 2024 7
E. THAT no legal rights or obligations will arise or be created by Council’s adoption
of A through D unless and until all legal documentation has been executed and
delivered by the respective parties.
CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY
AND BY THE REQUIRED MAJORITY (Vote No. 10240)
2. Potential to Update the Vancouver Building Bylaw to enable Single Egress Stairs
Low & Mid-Rise Buildings to Align with Provincial Changes to the BC Building
Code and Deliver Better Quality Housing Options
The Committee heard from two speakers who spoke in support of the motion and one speaker
who spoke to other aspects of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
SECONDED by Councillor Klassen
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. This Council has committed to and is advancing work on streamlining policies,
processes and permitting, in order to deliver more housing faster to help address
the housing crisis in Vancouver;
2. Missing middle housing options and options for families and family-sized units
are an important part of the housing continuum, and are options that are sorely
needed in Vancouver;
3. In October 2023, Council passed the motion entitled “Accelerating Housing
Delivery Through Transformative Change” where Council directed staff to explore
the steps and measures to harmonize and otherwise align the Vancouver
Building By-law (VBBL), which regulates the design and construction of buildings
(including administrative provisions related to permitting, inspections, and the
enforcement of these requirements), with the BC Building Code (BCBC), which
governs how new construction, building alterations, repairs and demolitions are
completed, for a more rapid delivery of housing in the City of Vancouver. And the
motion directed that staff outline the differences and distinctions between the
City’s By-law and the Province’s Building Code, along with the impacts of these
differences and distinctions in terms of the timely delivery of housing;
4. On August 29, 2024, the Province of BC and BC Minister of Housing announced
changes to the BC Building Code (BCBC) allowing single egress stair (SES)
designs in low and mid-rise buildings, with the intention of having larger layouts
and more multi-bedroom apartment options available for families and people who
need them, and where development was previously not possible due to lot size,
cost and other limitations.

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, October 09, 2024 8
The Provincial updates to the BCBC removed the code requirement for a second
egress, or exit, stairwell per floor in buildings up to six (6) stories, to make it
possible to build housing projects on smaller lots and in different configurations,
while allowing more flexibility for multi-bedroom apartments, more density within
areas of transit-oriented developments and the potential to improve energy
efficiency in buildings. Previously, the BCBC called for at least two egress
stairwells in buildings three storeys and higher.
To ensure the continuing safety for residents, updated BCBC requires that all
new SES designed buildings will require specific safety measures, including
sprinklers, smoke-management systems and wider stairwells;
5. The BCBC SES changes were drafted following the release of the report, “Single
Egress Stair Building Designs: Policy and Technical Options”, in June 2024 that
included engagement with representatives of the fire services community
amongst other stakeholders; and
6. On September 3rd, the Fire Chiefs Association of BC (FCABC) and the BC
Professional Fire Fighters Association (BCPFFA) raised concerns regarding the
BC Provincial Government amendment of the BCBC to allow a Single Exit
Stairway (SES) in multi-residential buildings, indicating that the changes
responded to some of the fire service’s concerns identified in the report authored
for the Province on June 25, 2024 by Robert Heikkila, with Jensen Hughes
entitled Single Egress Stair Building Designs: Policy and Technical Options
Report, but did not go far enough to address all life safety concerns.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to report back in Q4 2024 on the potential to and
required changes needed to align the Vancouver Building By-law with the BC
Building Code, in order to permit single egress stairs in low & mid-rise buildings
in buildings up to six (6) stories to enable larger layouts and more multi-bedroom
apartment options for families and people who need them.
B. THAT the report back be guided by advice of Vancouver Fire & Rescue Services
and consideration of VFRS concerns, or recommendations with respect to the
identification or potential inclusion of supporting life safety and firefighting
measures.

3. Reviewing Council’s Committees & Structure to Enhance Decision-Making
Processes
The Committee heard from one speaker who spoke in support of the motion and one speaker
who spoke to other aspects of the motion.
MOVED by Mayor Sim
SECONDED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. Committees allow boards and elected government bodies, such as municipal
Councils, to split up tasks to get their work accomplished, while enabling a more
granular level of community and stakeholder engagement. As a rule, committees

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, October 09, 2024 11
are not decision-making bodies. Rather, they make recommendations to a board
or Council which then make the final decisions;
2. Committees are a practical way to divide the work of a board into manageable
tasks that structure the work. Committees can be smaller groups that can be
more focused and efficient in dealing with specific issues than a full Council or
board, allowing time to thoroughly discuss issues in support of good decision
making;
3. Section 159 of the Vancouver Charter authorizes Council to provide for any such
committees it may see fit to establish and to refer any matter to a committee for
report. Likewise, section 161 authorizes Council to delegate any of the executive
or administrative powers exercisable by the Council, with or without restrictions
or conditions, to any committee comprised of members of the Council,
employees of the city, or members of the Council and employees of the City;
4. Council also has the authority to establish (and to disband) committees, whether
they be ad-hoc, time-limited committees or standing advisory committees, as well
as the power to strike task forces to explore specific questions;
5. There are approximately 30 civic agencies (Boards, Commissions, Committees,
Panels) appointed by City Council, most of which are advisory to Council and/or
staff, while some are administered by external organizations such as the PNE or
the Vancouver Public Library;
6. The City's Procedure By-law (BY-LAW NO. 12577) includes several definitions
relevant to committees under section 1.2 including “advisory committee” which
means a committee of persons, who are not Council members or staff members,
and who are appointed by Council to advise the Mayor, Council, or staff.
Likewise, “standing committee” means a Council committee established by
Council;
7. As a matter of good governance practices, boards are frequently encouraged to
be self-reflective and ask themselves key questions on a periodic basis such as
(but not limited to):
• Does the board have too many committees such that board members are
being stretched thin and having to attend too many meetings?
• Are committee assignments distributed evenly across the board so that every
member has a chance to be involved in committee work?
• Are there committees that could be turned into task forces or ad-hoc
committees with a specific objective to be accomplished within a specific time
frame?
• Are committees focused on policy and strategic items, or are they getting
involved in operations?
• Are any committees duplicating another committee’s work or the staff’s work?

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, October 09, 2024 12
8. Although the City's Advisory Committees and civic agencies provide valuable
insights and recommendations to the Council, there is a continuous need to
evolve and adapt municipal governance structures to meet the changing needs
and demands of the city and its residents. As with any governance body, it is
incumbent upon Council to pay close attention to the changing needs of the
organization and to make sure that its committees and committee structures
continue to meet those needs effectively;
9. The City's current committee structure has been in place for a significant period
of time and would therefore benefit from a comprehensive review, with an eye to
potential renewal and reorganization, to ensure that it meets the evolving needs
of the City's from a governance and community engagement perspective;
10. A streamlined and efficient committee structure has the potential to enhance the
work of City committees, as well as the decision-making processes of Council,
and foster more direct and effective communication between the public and
Council; and
11. It is the responsibility of Council to ensure that the governance structures in place
are efficient, effective, and provide the best possible framework for decision-
making and public participation and are in alignment with the strategic priorities
of the City and Council.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to report back in Q1
2025 with a review and assessment of the City’s current committee structure(s)
and system(s), including options for alternative approaches to efficiently align
committee structure(s) and system(s) with the strategic priorities of the City and
Council.
