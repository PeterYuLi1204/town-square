2. Turning the Key: Encouraging Affordable Home Ownership in the City of
Vancouver
MOVED by Councillor De Genova
SECONDED by Councillor Dominato
WHEREAS
1. Vancouver is facing a housing affordability crisis;
2. Council hears from the public on a regular basis related to matters including the
need for affordable housing in the City of Vancouver;
3. On June 23, 2015, Council unanimously approved the motion titled “Affordable
Home Ownership and Alternative Housing Options.” At the April 21, 2016
meeting of Council, staff presented recommendations for an Affordable Home
Ownership Pilot Program. This program was also unanimously supported by
Council;
4. Since the 2016 Council approval of the Affordable Home Ownership Pilot
Program, staff have informed Council that a change of the Vancouver Charter is
necessary before the City of Vancouver can move forward with Affordable Home
Ownership;
5. The July 2017 Housing Engagement Summary reports summarizes on Page 17
titled “Affordability and Availability of Housing, Cost of Living”, reports the first

Council Meeting
Minutes, January 19 and 20, 2021 26
concern to be “lack of opportunities for affordable home ownership affecting
future decisions to make Vancouver home.”;
6. a) BC Housing’s “Housing Hub” Affordable Home Ownership Program
(AHOP) supports new affordable home ownership units created in
communities with housing need, interim construction financing approved
for new projects and AHOP mortgages registered on title. BC Housing
states the objective of this program being “to Increase the supply and
range of affordable home ownership options for eligible households
across British Columbia and support the transition to home ownership.
b) Despite BC Housing’s AHOP program, only a couple of homes have
been developed, utilizing the program.
7. Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) through partnerships
partnership under the National Housing Co-investment Fund (NHCF) have also
committed to a 3-year partnership (2019-2021). CMHC also offers other
programs to aid in affordable home ownership.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to work with BC Housing to formalize goals for BC
Housing’s Affordable Home Ownership Program in the City of Vancouver,
including a possible Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) specific to
Affordable Homeownership, inline with both the City of Vancouver and
province’s goals for middle-income housing.
B. THAT Council direct staff to approach CMHC and inquire of any possible
programs that may be available, incentivize affordable home-ownership for
middle-income households, over housing options currently offered at market
rates.
C. THAT Council affirm that any opportunities that may come available through
partnerships in this resolution, not minimize the commitment or impact the ability
of the City of Vancouver to move forward with the creation of much needed
shelter-rate and non-market housing.
D. THAT Council direct staff to identify opportunities, including areas where zoning
is appropriate for the Affordable Home Ownership.
E. THAT Council direct staff to report back to Council as soon as possible, and no
later than Q3 2021 with an update including recommendations for policy to
move forward with BC Housing’s affordable homeownership program, including
targets for the number of homes the program will deliver in the City of

NEW BUSINESS
1. An Urgent Motion to seek COVID-19 Wage Subsidy Funding for the PNE from
Senior Levels of Government
MOVED by Councillor Dominato
SECONDED by Councillor De Genova
WHEREAS
1. The Pacific National Exhibition (PNE) is an iconic provincial institution with 110
years of history in British Columbia. It is the largest employer of youth in the
province and employs 4,300 people at the height of its season each year
(52% of PNE staff are under the age of 21);
2. The PNE brings a diversity of people together from different ethnicities,
interests, and income levels through music, sport, cultural events, family
entertainment, and recreation. These activities provide the financial foundation
to support the PNE’s social purpose of investing into programs for education,
agriculture, arts and culture, accessibility, youth and community;
3. As of Jan 2004, ownership of the PNE was transferred from the Province to the
City of Vancouver (having previously been a Provincial Crown Corp for
40 years). The PNE operates at arm’s length from the City and has an

Council Meeting
Minutes, January 19 and 20, 2021 29
independent Board of Directors. The PNE’s operations are not funded by the
City;
4. On April 18, 2020, BC’s Chief Medical Officer confirmed that large gatherings
would not happen during the summer of 2020, which severely impacted the
ability of the PNE to put on the PNE Fair, to open Playland, or to host revenue
generating concerts, festivals, consumer shows, and festivals. All activities were
eliminated for the 2020 season which resulted in $52 million in cancelled event
revenues and substantial layoffs (93% of the PNE’s full time union team and
50% of its management team were laid off);
5. Due to the fact of the PNE’s municipal ownership structure, the PNE has been
unintentionally excluded from all federal COVID recovery programs including the
wage subsidy (CEWS). To date, the PNE has not received a single dollar from
any recovery program at any level of Government;
6. All other Fairs across Canada (CNE, Calgary Stampede, Edmonton Klondike
days, Cloverdale Rodeo, BC AgriFair) are receiving the federal wage subsidy.
Likewise, the PNE’s entertainment industry counterparts and venues are also
receiving the wage subsidy (Rogers Arena, Brand Live, Live Nation) which
clearly puts the PNE at a significant disadvantage in the present and in the
post-COVID recovery period to come;
7. The level of debt incurred by the PNE in 2020 as a direct result of COVID-19
was $10.5 million which has seriously impeded the PNE’s cash flow and its
ability to recover and mount programs in 2021 should restrictions be lifted by the
Medical Health Officer;
8. If the PNE had been eligible for the wage subsidy, the PNE would have received
$3.6 million (as of November 25, 2020) and close to $6 million by June of 2021
– which is when the wage subsidy program is scheduled to end;
9. As one of the largest Fairs in Canada, the PNE is now at a dramatic
disadvantage in its ability to recover past 2021 even after freezing all spending,
laying off all but essential services staff, and shutting down ventures and
deferring capital payments with lenders;
10. Financial aid to reduce the PNE’s COVID related debt and subsidize program
costs in 2021 will be required for the organization to remain viable in the
post-COVID period.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Vancouver City Council call on the federal and provincial governments to
support the Pacific National Exhibition (PNE) with wage subsidy funding on a
