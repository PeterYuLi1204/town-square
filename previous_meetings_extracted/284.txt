MOVED by Mayor Sim
SECONDED by Councillor Zhou
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. The City of Vancouver, including the Vancouver Board of Parks and Recreation
(“Park Board”), is primarily created and governed by the Vancouver Charter
(“VC”), a provincial statute enacted in 1953 that incorporates the City of
Vancouver;
2. The VC sets out the statutory powers and authorities which govern the City of
Vancouver, and provides a range of powers and responsibilities different from
those of other communities governed primarily by the Community Charter (“CC”)
and the Local Government Act (“LGA”);
3. The VC governs how the City operates, what by-laws Council can enact, and
how budgets are determined. Under the VC, Council has the authority to enact
by-laws to regulate such things as noise and land use, to buy and sell property,

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, December 13, 2023 14
to collect certain taxes, to approve expenditures, and to take on debt, give
grants, and hire and discharge employees;
4. The Park Board is established by section 485 of the VC (Part XXIII – Parks),
which reads:
“A board of commissioners, to be known as the "Board of Parks and Recreation"
or "Park Board," shall be elected as hereinafter provided, and shall consist of
seven members or such other number as the Council may by by-law prescribe.
The Board has the legal capacity to exercise the powers bestowed on it and to
enforce those powers and the exercise thereof by actions, proceeding or
prosecution.”;
5. The Park Board looks after 250 public parks and beaches, including Stanley
Park, VanDusen Botanical Garden, Bloedel Conservatory, and a large public
recreation system of 24 community centres, swimming pools, rinks and arenas,
sport playing fields, playgrounds, fitness centres, three championship golf
courses, street trees, and marinas, among other services and facilities;
6. The City of Vancouver is the only municipality in Canada with an elected park
board, with the exception of the Cultus Lake Park Board which is made up of five
elected Commissioners (i.e., three elected from the Cultus Lake Park jurisdiction
and two elected from the City of Chilliwack jurisdiction);
7. Vancouver’s Auditor General (AGO) recently released a performance audit report
of the revenue management practices of the Park Board. The audit determined
that while some processes were used to inform fee-setting, the Park Board did
not operate an effective framework for achieving revenue-related objectives for
its revenue-generating assets and services;
8. The AGO’s audit report further noted that the Park Board’s overall funding
structure, as set out in the VC, requires it to obtain City Council approval for all
expenditures, including the expenditure of funds generated from revenue-
generating activities. The audit found that while the Park Board has strategies to
guide the delivery of parks and recreation services, it had not proactively
engaged with City Council to align its priorities with available funding;
9. Vancouver's parks, recreation, and cultural assets are prized by Vancouverites
and visitors alike and must be protected, maintained, and preserved sustainably
and in good working order for future generations;
10. The Park Board, for most practical intents, functions like any other department of
the City, albeit as a separate entity with significant independent authority through
its elected board;
11. Over the years, the Province has amended the VC numerous times to
accommodate the changing needs and priorities of the city. Some amendments
have been significant while others have been consequential and/or incidental to
other legislation introduced by the Province;

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, December 13, 2023 15
12. In recent years it has become abundantly clear, given the poor state of
Vancouver’s parks, recreation services, and infrastructure, that a fundamental
change in governance structure is not only needed, it is the only viable path
forward to an efficient and effective parks and recreation service for the people of
Vancouver.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council formally request that the Province of British Columbia amend or
repeal section 485 of the Vancouver Charter (“VC”) to remove the requirement
for an elected board of commissioners, variously referenced in legislation and
elsewhere as the "Board of Parks and Recreation" and/or "Park Board", including
any and all consequential and/or incidental amendments required to the VC
and/or other related legislation, including that any and all legal obligations of the
Park Board be assumed by the City;
FURTHER THAT the legal capacity to exercise the powers currently bestowed
on the Park Board under the VC, and the authority to enforce those powers, shall

During discussion on the amendment above, Councillor Bligh rose on a point of order, under
section 8.7(f) of the Procedure By-law, stating that the amendment above is frivolous as it is
outside of the City’s jurisdiction to engage in discussion with the Nations around their

Councillor Bligh’s point of order and ruled the amendment out of order.

FINAL MOTION AS APPROVED
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. The City of Vancouver, including the Vancouver Board of Parks and Recreation
(“Park Board”), is primarily created and governed by the Vancouver Charter
(“VC”), a provincial statute enacted in 1953 that incorporates the City of
Vancouver;
2. The VC sets out the statutory powers and authorities which govern the City of
Vancouver, and provides a range of powers and responsibilities different from

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, December 13, 2023 19
those of other communities governed primarily by the Community Charter (“CC”)
and the Local Government Act (“LGA”);
3. The VC governs how the City operates, what by-laws Council can enact, and
how budgets are determined. Under the VC, Council has the authority to enact
by-laws to regulate such things as noise and land use, to buy and sell property,
to collect certain taxes, to approve expenditures, and to take on debt, give
grants, and hire and discharge employees;
4. The Park Board is established by section 485 of the VC (Part XXIII – Parks),
which reads:
“A board of commissioners, to be known as the "Board of Parks and Recreation"
or "Park Board," shall be elected as hereinafter provided, and shall consist of
seven members or such other number as the Council may by by-law prescribe.
The Board has the legal capacity to exercise the powers bestowed on it and to
enforce those powers and the exercise thereof by actions, proceeding or
prosecution.”;
5. The Park Board looks after 250 public parks and beaches, including Stanley
Park, VanDusen Botanical Garden, Bloedel Conservatory, and a large public
recreation system of 24 community centres, swimming pools, rinks and arenas,
sport playing fields, playgrounds, fitness centres, three championship golf
courses, street trees, and marinas, among other services and facilities;
6. The City of Vancouver is the only municipality in Canada with an elected park
board, with the exception of the Cultus Lake Park Board which is made up of five
elected Commissioners (i.e., three elected from the Cultus Lake Park jurisdiction
and two elected from the City of Chilliwack jurisdiction);
7. Vancouver’s Auditor General (AGO) recently released a performance audit report
of the revenue management practices of the Park Board. The audit determined
that while some processes were used to inform fee-setting, the Park Board did
not operate an effective framework for achieving revenue-related objectives for
its revenue-generating assets and services;
8. The AGO’s audit report further noted that the Park Board’s overall funding
structure, as set out in the VC, requires it to obtain City Council approval for all
expenditures, including the expenditure of funds generated from revenue-
generating activities. The audit found that while the Park Board has strategies to
guide the delivery of parks and recreation services, it had not proactively
engaged with City Council to align its priorities with available funding;
9. Vancouver's parks, recreation, and cultural assets are prized by Vancouverites
and visitors alike and must be protected, maintained, and preserved sustainably
and in good working order for future generations;
10. The Park Board, for most practical intents, functions like any other department of
the City, albeit as a separate entity with significant independent authority through
its elected board;

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, December 13, 2023 20
11. Over the years, the Province has amended the VC numerous times to
accommodate the changing needs and priorities of the city. Some amendments
have been significant while others have been consequential and/or incidental to
other legislation introduced by the Province;
12. In recent years it has become abundantly clear, given the poor state of
Vancouver’s parks, recreation services, and infrastructure, that a fundamental
change in governance structure is not only needed, it is the only viable path
forward to an efficient and effective parks and recreation service for the people of
Vancouver.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council formally request that the Province of British Columbia amend or
repeal section 485 of the Vancouver Charter (“VC”) to remove the requirement
for an elected board of commissioners, variously referenced in legislation and
elsewhere as the "Board of Parks and Recreation" and/or "Park Board", including
any and all consequential and/or incidental amendments required to the VC
and/or other related legislation, including that any and all legal obligations of the
Park Board be assumed by the City;
FURTHER THAT the legal capacity to exercise the powers currently bestowed
on the Park Board under the VC, and the authority to enforce those powers, shall
be devolved to and bestowed upon Council, and the delivery of parks and
recreation services shall be administered by the City in accordance with Council
direction;
AND FURTHER THAT, in accordance with the above, Council formally request
that the Province of British Columbia amend the process for revoking and/or
cancelling the designation of areas designated as permanent public parks of the
City under the VC, notably under section 488 of the VC (“Parks in care of
Board”), to a unanimous vote of all Council members, along with provisions for a
public referendum.
B. THAT a Parks and Recreation Transition Working Group (“PRTWG”) (Type D
advisory body) be convened to facilitate the smooth transition of responsibility for
park and recreation services, from the current oversight by an elected Park
Board to the oversight of Council;
FURTHER THAT the PRTWG shall have a time-limited mandate of six (6)
months to coordinate the ongoing engagement and relationships with park and
recreation stakeholders, supported by City staff, and be comprised of the
Council, the Mayor’s Chief of Staff, two City Councillors appointed by Council, a
current Park Board Commissioner appointed by Council, and up to six (6)
members of the public appointed by Council, with Terms of Reference for the
working group to be determined by Council in consultation with, and under the
advisement of, the City Manager and the General Manager of Parks and
Recreation.
