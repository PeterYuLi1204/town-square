2. Weddings at Vancouver City Hall
On December 18, 2018, Vancouver City Council referred the following Motion to the Standing
Committee on Policy and Strategic Priorities meeting on December 19, 2018, in order to hear
from speakers.
The registered speakers were not present in the Chamber.
MOVED by Councillor De Genova
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. City Halls across North America have traditionally served as venues for couples
who are looking to have simple and small civil marriage ceremonies;
2. Most City Halls across Canada, offering civil marriage services or venues as a
wedding, state that the time of a ceremony ranges between 10 and 20 minutes
and can accommodate a range of 5 to 30 guests per wedding;

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, December 19, 2018 3
3. City Halls in Canada, including Victoria City Hall, Calgary City Hall, Fredericton
City Hall, Ottawa City Hall and Toronto (both Old and New City Halls) offer the
opportunity for couples to book in advance and hold wedding ceremonies on-site;
4. Some City Halls, including Toronto, offer City Hall weddings in a dedicated
space. Offering weekends on set days (four days of the year) and typical non-
business hours is a practice of many Canadian City Halls, including Victoria;
5. At Ottawa City Hall, couples can choose weekday or weekend options for
weddings, at a cost ranging from $141.30 for week day ceremonies to $212.00
for weekends, subject to availability. A marriage license can be obtained on-site
for a $161.60 fee, if all requirements are satisfied. Ceremonies are offered in
both English and French;
6. Although the Vancouver Board of Parks and Recreation offers couples the option
of applying for permits to be married on designated and non-designated sites; the
City of Vancouver does not currently have a program to permit weddings at
Vancouver City Hall;
7. Vancouver City Hall opened December 4, 1936, and was designated a heritage
building in 1976;
8. Vancouver City Hall was built by the architectural firm of Townley and Matheson.
The City of Vancouver website states “On the third floor, the ceremonial and
formal spaces including the Council Chamber are substantially intact. The
chamber are two stories in height, with a rear wall balcony, central inset clock,
high windows, large brass wall sconces, and beautifully veneered wall panels.
The woodwork is lovingly detailed and is very well preserved. The four large
modernistic cast brass suspended chandeliers, with obscure glass insets, still
light the Chamber.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT in the spirit of increasing accessibility,
welcoming the public and acknowledging the historical significance of Vancouver City
Hall, Council directs staff to:
i. explore the possibility of offering Vancouver City Hall as a venue for
weddings and civil ceremonies at and on the grounds of Vancouver City
Hall;
ii. consider the structure City Halls across Canada practice in providing a
venue for marriage and in some cases, providing services including
resources to obtain a marriage commissioner, officiant or the necessary
documents required for marriage in BC;
iii. report back to Council with recommendations, including any budget
implications, and recommendations for the possibility of a pilot or trial
program for holding weddings on set days of the year, or regularly at
Vancouver City Hall;

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, December 19, 2018 4
iv. ensure the Council Chamber, Helena Gutteridge Plaza and the garden at
Vancouver City Hall are considered as possible options for weddings in
any recommendations brought back to Council for consideration;
v. report back to Council with recommendations by December 2019.
amended
AMENDMENT MOVED by Councillor Wiebe
THAT the motion be amended to add the following paragraph as vi:
vi. look at options to work with the digital strategy team and the Vancouver
Park Board to streamline the process for booking a wedding at all civic
venues.

Committee on Policy and Strategic Priorities meeting on December 19, 2018, in order to hear
from speakers.
The registered speaker was not present in the Chamber.
MOVED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. Meetings of Vancouver City Council are governed by the Procedure By-law
No. 9756 which was enacted on November 25, 2008, and consolidated for
convenience to March 27, 2012;
2. Hearing from residents of Vancouver and providing residents the opportunity to
speak to City Council on civic matters is an important and fundamental aspect of
our democratic process;
3. The current processes governing or being followed regarding hearing of
speakers at Council and Committee meetings are inefficient and unpredictable
for residents and are resulting in long delays with speakers oftentimes waiting for
hours on end for the opportunity to address Council on their desired agenda item.
Speakers are often pushed to late in an evening, the following days or even the
following week;
4. Current processes often result in speaker drop-off as residents have jobs and
commitments, varying circumstances, accessibility needs and transportation

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, December 19, 2018 5
considerations. Conditions are not being created to allow our diverse voices in
the city to be heard;

their local civic government and to reduce barriers.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to report back before the end
of January 2019 with recommendations and proposed changes that could improve the
process and predictability for the scheduling of speakers for items on Council agendas;

Council day versus automatic referral to Standing Committees, as well as the potential to
schedule specific time slots and speaker times. Additionally, that staff indicate any

with the goal of improving resident participation and experience at Vancouver City
Council.

2. In 2018, the Provincial Government released “Childcare B.C., Caring for Kids,
Lifting up Families: The Path to Universal Childcare”. The document states
“Vancouver is one of the most expensive cities for Childcare with a median fee of
$1,250 per month for infant and toddler care”. The document also commits to
providing grants to local governments in British Columbia to support building new
child care spaces and creating plans to inform local needs.
3. On June 26, 2018, The City of Vancouver issued a press release celebrating
1064 new child care spaces. On the City of Vancouver website, Mayor Gregor
Robertson is stated as saying “Making sure that families have access to
affordable childcare is a key part of building a healthy, inclusive city and helps set
our kids up for success now and down the road”.
4. The City of Vancouver Document “Technical Guidelines” published by Real
Estate and Facilities Management in May of 2018 states that “Development
Permits may be required for new childcare facilities. Building and Occupancy
Permits are required for all new childcare facilities.
5. A Child Care Facility’s childcare license will need to be obtained by the Childcare
Operator from Community Care Facilities Licensing, a department of Vancouver
Coastal Health, before an Occupancy Permit can be obtained. Nowhere in the
document does it state that there is a policy to streamline and expedite the
processes associated with permits and licensing for new childcare facilities.
6. The City of Vancouver Document “Steps for Establishing a Child Care Centre in
an Existing Building” published by the Social Development Department was last
updated in 2008.
7. The City of Vancouver website page “Developing a childcare centre” states “Staff
work with developers, architects, landscape architects, and early childhood
educators to make sure that every new center includes urban design best
practices, and contributes to a child’s mental and physical development”. There
is no mention of incentives or expediting the processes for childcare facilities in
Vancouver.
8. On September 19, 2018, the motion entitled “Family Friendly Vancouver:
Citywide Policy to Fast Track and Expedite Projects that include new Child Care
Centres in the City of Vancouver” was referred to staff. It is anticipated that staff
will report back to Council in June 2019.
9. On September 2018, the British Columbia Ministry of Children and Family
Development issued a press release titled “Partnerships give B.C. families
quicker access to child care”. The release states “Municipal and regional
government in B.C. are eligible for up to $1 million per project through the new
Community Child Care Space Creation Program. Priority will be given to projects
that build spaces that serve infants and toddlers, offer care outside of regular
business hours, are operated by a public body or non-profit, and/or benefit
underserved populations”.
10. Phase 1 Actions of the Women’s Equity Strategy include “Identify child-friendly
provisions to accommodate participation by families with children at Council and
