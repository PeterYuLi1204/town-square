COUNCIL MEMBERS’ MOTIONS
1. A Drain on Resources and Resources Down the Drain: Pulling the plug on In-Sink
Garbage Disposal
The Committee heard from two speakers who spoke in support of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Fry
SECONDED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. First invented a hundred years ago, the in-sink food disposal unit (also known as
in-sink garbage disposal unit or garburator) is an electrically powered mechanical
macerator or grinder, designed to shred food waste into pieces small enough to
pass through plumbing. The process effectively diverts food waste from
composting or landfill to be processed via wastewater treatment plants.
2. Garburators add a significant load of organic solids and nutrients to wastewater
systems, increasing the strain on treatment facilities and potentially causing clogs
and higher water usage, in contrast to normal household drainage of blackwater
and greywater, which, while still requiring robust treatment, generally poses less
strain in terms of solids and nutrient loads compared to garburator waste.
3. Specific impacts of in sink food disposal on wastewater treatment systems
include:
a. Increased Solid Load: Food waste from garbage disposals adds to the solid
matter in wastewater, requiring more effort to remove before treatment can
begin. Solids must be physically separated and disposed of, adding to
operational costs.
b. Higher Nutrient Loads: The organic matter from food waste contributes to
higher nutrient loads, such as nitrogen and phosphorus. These nutrients can
lead to issues like oxygen depletion in water bodies, affecting aquatic life
c. Operational Strain: The additional solid load can settle in treatment basins,
clog pumps, and damage equipment, leading to increased maintenance and
replacement costs.
d. Contaminants: If not carefully screened, in sink garbage disposal can
introduce contaminants like PFAS (forever chemicals) and microplastics into
the wastewater stream, which can be recirculated in the treated water or
separated bio-sludge.
e. Methane Generation: Organic material and food waste can also decompose
in sewer systems before reaching treatment plants, releasing methane, a
potent greenhouse gas.
f. Clogged Pipes: Food waste can also create significant problems in the
sanitary sewer pipe network. Notably, fats, oils, and grease (FOG) congeal

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, July 9, 2025 11
and solidify into “fatbergs” that can result in clogs, sewage backups, and
overflows necessitating expensive remediation. Every year Metro Vancouver
spends more than $2.7 million fixing grease damage in the sewer system.1
4. Food Waste isn’t Garbage. Composting food waste is a better approach than
diverting it to wastewater treatment, primarily because composting offers a
valuable resource at a lower cost. Composting is more environmentally friendly,
resource-efficient and regulatorily compliant. In Metro Vancouver, food scraps
have been banned from solid waste disposal since January 2015.
5. Stricter modern water quality standards are requiring increasingly costly water
treatment technologies. Liquid waste in Vancouver is processed at the 1963-
commissioned Iona Island Wastewater Treatment Plant and is scheduled to be
upgraded from primary to tertiary treatment at a cost of $10 billion (2025).2
6. Source separation, diverting organic solids from grey and black water is largely
seen as a cost-effective measure to mitigate the cost of wastewater treatment.
As a result many municipalities have banned garburators, including Toronto
(2002), Victoria (2002 – industrial use), Ottawa (2003), Kingston (2008), Barrie
(2012), Squamish (2016).3 The City of Vancouver currently has a food waste
diversion plan in Solid Waste By-law No. 8417 4 that prohibits the unlawful
disposal of food waste. The City’s Sewer and Watercourse By-law No. 8093 5
regulates the quantity and quality of discharged wastes into the sewerage
system.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to amplify Metro Vancouver messaging and remind
residents via the City’s own Waste Disposal and Recycling webpage, printed
pickup schedules, and information channels to publicly communicate the cost,
infrastructure and environmental impacts of in-sink disposal, and encourage
residents’ use of composting and green bin organic waste diversion.
B. THAT Council direct staff to report back with proposed amendments to the
Building By-law to prohibit in sink disposal units in new construction in the City

Vancouver;
FURTHER THAT Council direct staff to report back with proposed amendments
to the Solid Waste By-law and Sewer and Watercourse By-law to properly divert
food scraps from liquid waste disposal.
C. THAT Council requests that the Mayor write a letter to the Chair and Board of
Metro Vancouver advising concerns over the impacts of in-sink disposal units on
wastewater treatment plant costs and urging a regional approach to curtail the
use of in-sink disposal units, and ban food scrap from liquid waste disposal.

2. From Vacancy to Vitality: Launching a Temporary Use Pilot for Empty Storefronts
in the Downtown Eastside
The Committee heard from two speakers who spoke in support of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Klassen
SECONDED by Councillor Zhou
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. The Downtown Eastside is a culturally rich but economically challenged area
facing persistently high commercial vacancy rates where the number of
storefronts sitting empty hover at levels as high as 32%. This level is well above
the 5% to 7% vacancy range considered healthy for urban neighbourhood (City
of Vancouver Storefront Report, 2023);
2. Empty storefronts, including those in surrounding neighbourhoods such as
Hastings Crossing and Strathcona, not only represent lost economic potential,
they also contribute to perceptions of decline and disorder, especially in areas
already impacted by poverty, open drug use, and visible mental health crises;
3. The Downtown Eastside has a strong history of fostering arts and culture,
including work by celebrated street artists, indigenous artists, and providing the
foundations for an emerging arts district;
4. Despite demand from prospective tenants, including artists, small business
owners, social enterprises, and community organizations, barriers such as
complex City permitting processes and rigid zoning classifications make it difficult
to occupy these spaces, even on a temporary basis;
5. Business Improvement Associations (BIAs) have expressed strong support for a
collaborative, community-led pilot that would enable safe, short-term activation of

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, July 9, 2025 13
ground-floor vacancies for public benefit;
6. A Temporary Occupancy Pilot could unlock affordable, space for pop-up shops,
new entrepreneurs, artist studios, cultural production, and community uses, all of
which would bring new life to these neighbourhoods while supporting economic
inclusion and innovation;
7. There is also strong interest in expanding allowed temporary uses to include pop-
up restaurants and kitchens, peer support hubs, and light creative manufacturing,
all of which align well with the social fabric and mixed-use character of these
neighbourhoods;
8. The City of Vancouver has successfully implemented flexible permitting
frameworks in the past, such as the Arts Event Licence and the Special
Inspection process, which strike a balance between streamlined access and
health and life safety requirements; and
9. These past flexible permitting frameworks demonstrate that the City can enable
activation of underused space without compromising public safety, provided that
inspection and oversight are focused and responsive.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to report back in Q4 2025 with a proposed Temporary
Occupancy Pilot Program in the Downtown Eastside to allow vacant ground-floor
commercial spaces to be used for up to 12 months without rezoning or change of
use provided life safety standards are met;
FURTHER THAT the proposed pilot program design should:
• Prioritize uses that benefit the community, such as art studios, small retail,
cultural spaces, and enterprises that align well with the social fabric and
mixed-use character of these neighbourhoods;
• Consider expanding the program to also include temporary food uses (e.g.
commissary kitchens, pop-up dining), community services (e.g. counselling or
peer support), and light creative manufacturing activities;
• Incorporate any other recommendations that that staff consider would
advance the intended outcomes of the motion.
B. THAT staff be directed to report back by Q3 2026 on the pilot outcomes including
business activity, community engagement, and space occupancy, with
recommendations for improvements or possible city-wide expansion should the
pilot be successful.
C. THAT Council direct staff to explore creating a Temporary Retail, Business, and
Creative Use Event Licence, similar to the Arts Event Licence, to support future
short-term activations, in coordination with relevant City departments and

report back on a draft implementation strategy as a part of the upcoming DTES
Plan update.

3. Opening Doors: Expanding Ownership Options for Laneway and Backyard Homes
The Committee heard from four speakers who spoke in support of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
SECONDED by Councillor Klassen
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. Vancouver continues to face housing affordability challenges, particularly for first-
time buyers, young families, seniors, and multigenerational families;
2. Nearly 42% of single-family homes in Vancouver are owned mortgage-free by
individuals aged 65 or older, many of whom are interested in downsizing,
creating housing for extended family members, or wishing to age in place in their
neighbourhoods and communities;
3. While the City has recently enabled stratification and subdivision for multiplex
developments, the same opportunity does not currently apply to laneway homes
and Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs), even when these units meet the siting,
massing, and design guidelines of the R1-1 policy;
4. This distinction is policy-based rather than technical, and prevents homeowners
from leveraging existing equity to finance and contribute to new housing supply
and options, despite laneway homes and ADUs being compliant with all
applicable R1-1 standards;
5. Other jurisdictions such as Seattle and California have implemented policies that
allow ADUs to be stratified or subdivided, resulting in a surge of new housing
production and flexible ownership models; and
6. Broader access to subdivision or stratification for all detached secondary
dwellings, regardless of whether they are part of a multiplex or single-family lot,
would support Vancouver’s goals of aging in place, intergenerational housing,
and attainable homeownership.

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, July 9, 2025 15
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to explore and report back on options to allow the
subdivision or stratification of residential lots containing secondary detached
housing units (such as laneway homes or ADUs), particularly in situations where:
• The units comply with R1-1 zoning guidelines;
• The form and siting are functionally equivalent to those permitted in multiplex
subdivisions.
FURTHER THAT the staff report include:
• A comparison of subdivision and stratification rules for multiplex versus ADU
and laneway housing forms;
• Regulatory and legal pathways to enable stratification and/or fee-simple
ownership of laneway homes built alongside existing or new single-family
homes;
• Best practices from other jurisdictions (e.g., Seattle, California) that have
implemented similar reforms;
• Analysis of benefits related to housing supply, financing access, aging in
place, and use of equity by long-term homeowners;
• Alignment with the Vancouver Plan, Missing Middle Housing program, and
Climate Emergency Action Plan.
B. THAT staff engage with community members, homebuilders, mortgage lenders,
and legal experts in land ownership and titles to assess feasibility and policy
implications.

WHEREAS
1. The only acceptable number of deaths and serious injuries on Vancouver’s roads
is zero;
2. Vision Zero is a worldwide movement dedicated to eliminating traffic deaths and
serious injuries through proven interventions, including safer street design, which
is one of the City of Vancouver’s core responsibilities [The Vision Zero
Handbook];
3. The City of Vancouver has had an aspirational goal of moving towards zero
traffic-related fatalities since 2012 [Transportation 2040], and approved its
Moving Towards Zero Safety Action Plan in 2016 [City of Vancouver];
4. Between 2020 and 2024, motorists injured 3,505 cyclists and 3,079 pedestrians
in the City of Vancouver. Over the same period, crashes also injured 36,097
vehicle occupants [ICBC]. Road violence has claimed at least 10 lives per year in
this city for every year in the past decade except 2020. The highest number of
annual fatalities (22) occurred in 2021;
5. Though crashes hurt drivers and their passengers, injuries to those outside the
vehicle are generally more severe. Between 2018 and 2023, pedestrians and

6. Vehicle speed is the top factor contributing to traffic fatalities in British Columbia.
[ICBC]. Every one km/h speed increase results in a 3% increase in injury-causing
crashes, and increases fatalities by 4 to 5% [Government of British Columbia];
7. Streets designed to prioritize pedestrian safety encourage active transportation,
which improves public health [Health Canada], reduces traffic congestion, and
lowers neighbourhood air and noise pollution;
8. In 2023, parents or caregivers drove their children to primary school in the City of
Vancouver on 27,000 occasions. This number increased 3,000 trips over the
previous survey in 2017. Meanwhile, the number of elementary school trips made
by bike declined over the same period, from 3,000 in 2017 to 2,000 in 2023
[Translink]. Road safety concerns are frequently cited as a barrier to walking,
biking, or rolling to school, resulting in more children being driven to school than
ever before [About Here];
9. Though fewer than 20% of the City of Vancouver's residents are seniors, they
represent close to half of all pedestrian deaths in traffic crashes [CoV, Statistics
Canada]. Vancouver’s population is rapidly aging; between 2016 and 2021, the
population of people 65+ was five times that of those under age 65 [City of
Vancouver];
10. Other British Columbian local governments, such as the District of Saanich, have
recently adopted evidence-based plans to reduce traffic violence. The District of
Saanich’s 2024 Road Safety Action Plan sets a measurable target to cut traffic
fatalities and serious injuries in half by 2030, compared with a 2017–2021
baseline, and will regularly update its plan to ensure meaningful progress;
11. In 2020, the Province of British Columbia released a comprehensive Road Safety
Toolkit that aims to help local governments implement evidence-based road-
safety strategies [Government of BC]. The City could consider its
recommendations in an updated Moving Towards Zero Safety Action Plan; and
12. The City’s 2016 Moving Towards Zero Safety Action Plan has yet to substantially
reduce serious injuries and fatalities on Vancouver’s roads [City of Vancouver
(2016), City of Vancouver (2021), Vancouver Police Department].
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
THAT Vancouver City Council directs staff to:
i. Review the City’s Moving Towards Zero Safety Action Plan, develop a new
Vision Zero Road Safety Policy and Action Plan to reduce motor vehicle deaths
and serious injuries to zero in the City of Vancouver, and bring it back to Council
in Q2 2026.

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, July 9, 2025 18
ii. In drafting the policy and action plan, prioritize measures shown to substantially
reduce serious traffic injuries and deaths, and eliminate measures that have not
proven to be effective.
iii. Consider work done by other municipalities worldwide throughout the
development of the Vision Zero Road Safety Policy and Action Plan, including
cities that have achieved Vision Zero, and those that have recently updated their
Road Safety Action Plans with steps to achieve it.
iv. Take into consideration measures that will complement the work currently being
undertaken to prevent vehicle incursion into temporary and permanent
pedestrianized spaces in the City.
v. Consult relevant stakeholders including, but not limited to, BC Emergency Health
Services, BC Injury Research and Prevention Unit, District Parents’ Advisory
Councils, HUB Cycling, ICBC, Infrastructure Canada, the Provincial Ministry of
Transportation and Transit, Movement, Strong Towns Vancouver, neighbouring
municipalities, RoadSafetyBC, Society for Children and Youth of BC, the relevant

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, July 9, 2025 21
5. Unlocking the Creative and Economic Potential of Vancouver's Railtown District
The Committee heard from 11 speakers who spoke in support of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Bligh
SECONDED by Councillor Zhou
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. Vancouver's Railtown District is a unique and historically significant part of the
city with a rich industrial past. It once served as the industrial heart of the city
supporting the port, the railroad, and other vital industries such as fishing and
logging;
2. Railtown is currently designated as "Industrial" under Metro Vancouver’s 2050
Regional Growth Strategy and zoned as I-4 Industrial by the City of Vancouver;
3. Railtown is within walking distance to Waterfront Station, Vancouver’s largest
multi-modal transit hub, and is less than 75 metres from the Tier 3 Transit-
Oriented Area boundary;
4. Some of Vancouver’s largest and most successful homegrown companies, such
as Aritzia, Inform, Bocci, Hootsuite, and Herschel, have started in Railtown as
part of an emergent creative district that has coalesced in the area drawn by the
central location and unique vibe of this space; 6
5. The Railtown District encompasses approximately 11 acres of land with
approximately 800,000 sq/ft of leasable commercial space but faces numerous
challenges in terms of industrial land uses in the 21st Century. For example,
many of Railtown’s historic buildings do not conform to modern industrial space
requirements due to a lack of proper loading bays, freight elevators, low ceilings,
insufficient space for parking (let alone truck parking and yard storage), limited
opportunities for future expansion, and challenges for large trucks to access
major transportation routes and maneuver safely which results in high vacancy
rates amongst industrial-focused buildings;
6. Many of Railtown’s historic buildings are at risk of demolition due to Railtown
being one of the last commercial districts in the city with a continuous
streetscape of pre-1930s buildings that are not protected under the City’s
Heritage Conservation By-laws;
7. Employers in Railtown advise that the area suffers from poor east west
connections and that a review of and updates to the transportation network would
help facilitate employee retention and employment growth in the area (including
active transportation routes such as the Portside Greenway);
6 Bocci has announced plans to move further east due to Railtown’s logistical limitations.

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, July 9, 2025 22
8. Railtown currently struggles with prolonged and excessively high vacancy rates.
For example, the overall vacancy rate in the area is 13.2% and the vacancy rate
in industrial spaces is 31%7. This is very high compared to the industrial vacancy
rate in the region overall (3.8% in Q1 2025)8. Local building managers have
advised that vacancy rates in the area are purposefully under reported to help
prevent commercial lease rates from falling further;
9. Landowners in the area report that lease rates have dropped 50% from $35 PSF
in 2020 to $15 PSF in 2025;
10. Railtown is experiencing a decline in the number of businesses with a 31%
decrease in business licenses since 2014 coinciding with the implementation of
new I-4 zoning;
11. Area landowners report that Railtown is over-reliant on a single employer who
makes up 70% (~2,500) jobs in the area. Many businesses have expressed
concern over the deterioration of the area and are considering relocating outside
of Railtown;
12. Landowners in the area report that Railtown is lagging behind similar
neighbourhoods, for example between 2018 and 2024 Mount Pleasant’s total
building permit value was $254m while Railtown’s total building permit value was
$57m, representing almost a 4x value when compared to Railtown;
13. Landowners further report that 266,000 sq/ft of projects with approved
development applications have been abandoned due to lack of viability under the
current policy restrictions, pointing to a need and opportunity to align Railtown’s
heritage with other successfully reimagined former industrial areas that have
brought heritage and modern uses together;
14. As part of the approval of updates to the City’s Industrial Lands Policy in 2023,
staff recommended that Railtown be subject to future work to enable
opportunities for expansion of employment uses in the area;
15. Residential uses already exist along Railway and Alexander Streets, including 45
artist live/work units at 303 Railway (CD) and 15 at 329 Railway (I-4); 120
live/work and condo units at The Edge (298 Alexander, CD); and a concentration
of social and supportive housing, such as the City-owned 45-unit SRO at 305
Alexander (I-4), the 66-unit Jim Green Residence (CD), and the shelter at 467
Alexander (I-4). The 60 artist live/work studios at 303 Railway Street (CD) and
329 Railway Street (grandfathered in under I-4) are reported to have a 0%
vacancy rate;
16. Diversified housing options, including residential rental and artist live/work, are
critical to support employment, and creating mixed-use is consistent with the City
of Vancouver’s priorities of a 15-minute walkable city;

Minutes, Wednesday, July 9, 2025 23
17. Mixed-use neighbourhoods is consistent with the City of Vancouver’s priorities of
a 15-minute walkable city;
18. There is broad support from local property owners, businesses, and community
partners to reclassify the area and unlock new housing, jobs, and cultural
amenities. The Railtown Coalition represents property owners that make up a
total of 87% of the land within the I-4 zoning district and they support this
reclassification;
19. The Railtown Coalition representing 87% of Railtown’s land base (~430,000 sq.
ft.) is ready to work with the Planning Department to deliver sustainable, mixed-
use projects that create rental and artist housing without displacement, increase
employment spaces and services, and deliver public realm improvements
consistent with a master-planned and complete community. The coalition is
committed to ensuring these projects recognize the cultural diversity and
resilience of the Downtown Eastside, host Nations and urban Indigenous
communities and are ready to work with all partners to ensure future
development respects stakeholder rights, histories, and priorities;
20. Given Railtown’s small land area and exclusive I-4 zoning (not found anywhere
else), reclassification would allow for vitalization bringing a range of employment
opportunities and increased foot traffic to support local businesses and create
new services including public realm and cultural spaces; and
21. Reclassifying sites within Railtown from Industrial to General Urban in Metro
Vancouver’s Regional Land Use Designations is essential to supporting mixed-
use development in the area. This shift would allow for a broader mix of housing,
employment space, artist live/work opportunities, and vibrant public spaces. It is
a critical step toward realizing Railtown’s creative and economic potential,
fostering innovation, artistic expression, and entrepreneurship, while advancing
the city’s goals for economic diversification, cultural development, housing, and
urban revitalization.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
THAT Council direct staff to bring back options for Council’s consideration as part of the
ongoing local area planning for the Railtown District, including but not limited to potential
zoning changes and options for mixed-use development such as creating additional
artist live-work spaces, rental housing, new employment spaces, creative manufacturing
spaces for industrial start-ups, and more vibrant streetscapes;
FURTHER THAT Council direct staff to incorporate the following considerations as part
of the future Railtown Planning work:
• Increased employment with no net loss of the total inventory of industrial or
employment space currently found in Railtown;
• Transportation network enhancements for safe and active transport options in
and out of the area including better connections to the Gastown and Strathcona
Shopping Districts and work with TransLink to explore the potential re-routing

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, July 9, 2025 24
of key bus services into the Railtown area or providing alternative connections
to Waterfront Station and other transit hubs;
• Retail at grade, increased vibrancy, safety, eyes on the streets and 24/7
activity;
• Increased & diversified housing options including market rental housing and
live/work rental options;
• Consider which sites are best suitable for rental housing and artist live/work
spaces;
• Heritage protection and creative uses in heritage buildings such as live/work
spaces including the possibility of transferring density to other zones in the city
and incentives for the preservation of heritage buildings;
• Increase the overall flexibility of uses;
AND FURTHER THAT Council direct staff to initiate the work necessary for the
reclassification of Railtown sites from (I-4) “Industrial” to “General Urban”, where an area
planning opportunity is identified, and bring a referral report forward to amend the
Regional Context Statement Official Development Plan (RCS ODP) for Council’s
consideration and pending council approval, initiate the work with Metro Vancouver
Regional Board to subsequently amend the Metro Vancouver Regional Growth Strategy
2050 as required.

20. Given Railtown’s small land area and exclusive I-4 zoning (not found anywhere
else), reclassification would allow for vitalization bringing a range of employment
opportunities and increased foot traffic to support local businesses and create
new services including public realm and cultural spaces; and
21. Reclassifying sites within Railtown from Industrial to General Urban in Metro
Vancouver’s Regional Land Use Designations is essential to supporting mixed-
use development in the area. This shift would allow for a broader mix of housing,
employment space, artist live/work opportunities, and vibrant public spaces. It is
a critical step toward realizing Railtown’s creative and economic potential,
fostering innovation, artistic expression, and entrepreneurship, while advancing
the city’s goals for economic diversification, cultural development, housing, and
urban revitalization.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
THAT Council direct staff to bring back options for Council’s consideration as part of the
ongoing local area planning for the Railtown District, including but not limited to potential
zoning changes and options for mixed-use development such as creating additional
artist live-work spaces, a diversity of housing, new employment spaces, creative
manufacturing spaces for industrial start-ups, and more vibrant streetscapes;
FURTHER THAT Council direct staff to incorporate the following considerations as part
of the future Industrial and Employment Lands Framework updates, including current
Railtown Planning work:
• Increased employment, considerations for possible intensification of industrial
land uses that a) respect the genesis and evolution of Railtown as a successful
incubator hub for creative startups, b) honours Railtown’s impactful role as an
employment driver in the city, and c) results in no net loss of the total inventory of
industrial or employment space currently found in Railtown;
• Transportation network enhancements for safe and active transport options in
and out of the area including better connections to the Gastown and Strathcona
Shopping Districts and work with TransLink to explore the potential re-routing of

key bus services into the Railtown area or providing alternative connections to
Waterfront Station and other transit hubs;
• Retail at grade, increased vibrancy, safety, eyes on the streets and 24/7 activity;
• Increased & diversified housing options;
• Consider which sites may be suitable for a diversity of housing options;
• Heritage protection of Railtown’s continuous streetscape of pre-1930s buildings
not currently protected under the City’s Heritage Conservation By-laws and
consideration of compatible uses in heritage buildings such as live/work spaces
including the possibility of transferring density to other zones in the city and
incentives for the preservation of heritage buildings;
• Increase the overall flexibility of Railtown’s creative, industrial, and employment
land uses and its unique role as an employment driver in the city’s economy;
AND FURTHER THAT Council direct staff to initiate the work necessary for the
reclassification of Railtown sites from (I-4) “Industrial” to “General Urban”, where an area
planning opportunity is identified, and, along with planning opportunities for other
Industrial and Employment lands, bring a referral report forward to amend the Regional
Context Statement Official Development Plan (RCS ODP) for Council’s consideration
and pending council approval, initiate the work with Metro Vancouver Regional Board to
subsequently amend the Metro Vancouver Regional Growth Strategy 2050 as required.
