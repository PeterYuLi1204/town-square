2. A Comprehensive Strategy for Realizing the Full Potential of the Nighttime
Economy in the City of Vancouver
The Committee heard from five speakers in support of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Dominato
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. The City of Vancouver’s mission is to create a great city of communities that
cares about its people, its environment, and the opportunities to live, work, and
prosper;

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, June 26 and 27, 2019 8
2. Vancouver City Council recognizes that a resilient, diverse economy fosters
dynamic businesses and sustainable employment, and helps to attract and retain
professionals, families, and individuals who can live and work in our city;
3. The City of Vancouver has an Economic Action Strategy (2011), supported by
Council, as well various initiatives that have been undertaken to promote and
strengthen local business, to provide tools for Vancouver businesses to flourish
(while incorporating sustainable practices), and to make Vancouver an attractive
business locale and tourism destination for people from around the world;
4. The Vancouver Economic Commission (VEC), as the economic development
agency for the City of Vancouver, works to strengthen Vancouver’s economy by
supporting local companies, attracting high-impact investment, and promoting
international trade, with a particular focus on developing Vancouver’s creative
economy, knowledge economy, and green economy;
5. The City of Vancouver has embarked on a wide range of strategic initiatives, for
example, the Music Strategy and Creative City Strategy which each seek to
develop a comprehensive plan and vision for culture and creativity in Vancouver;
6. The City of Vancouver has a Healthy City Strategy that, among other goals and
objectives, recognizes that a thriving, diverse economy, with opportunity for
everyone, is the foundation of a liveable city, as well as recognizing that families
with children are key to a diverse and vibrant society;
7. In recent years, cities around the world have begun to pay greater attention to
the value and potential of the Nighttime Economy of their cities, whether it be the
whole of a city’s nightlife industry of dining and entertainment, various major
nightlife components such as music and craft beverages, or secondary economic
activity from transportation and related nightlife spending by patrons;
8. A recent study undertaken by the City of Toronto concluded that the Nighttime
economy is the “new competitive edge for post-industrial cities” and that Toronto
should undertake a vision and action plan to advance the night-time economy;
9. To underscore the value of the Nighttime Economy to the city of Vancouver and
the Metro Vancouver region, the Hospitality Vancouver Association (HVA), an
association that advocates for clubs, pubs, and other businesses along Granville
Street and the Davie Village, notes that the Granville Entertainment District
(GED) – as the social hub of Vancouver – employs thousands of people and
generates tens of millions of dollars in annual economic activity, including more
than 900 jobs and $43.5 million in annual revenue alone generated by the GED’s
14 liquor-primary businesses;
10. A June 2018 study of Vancouver’s “Music Ecosystem” commissioned by the
Music BC Industry Association, outlines several specific impediments to a
thriving Nighttime Economy, as faced by the city’s music sector, such as
“obstacles with permits and curfews in high-activity areas” which has led to a
paucity of music events, as well as “limited late transport options” available for
music audiences in the city.”;

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, June 26 and 27, 2019 9
11. There is a general shortage of family-friendly, substance-free Nighttime Economy
options and events in the city that are suitable for children, youth, and families,
and despite the City’s support for many aspects of the Nighttime Economy,
Vancouver has gained a reputation for being a “no fun” city in the minds of many;
12. Attracting greater numbers of people to a downtown social district can yield
greater nightlife vibrancy and economic growth, as noted by the International
City/County Management Association (ICMA), but it can also place demands on
public safety and other municipal resources and therefore requires a strong
foundation and a dedicated, comprehensive focus on the part of local
governments and other government levels to capitalize on the economic
opportunities;
13. At the May 2, 2018, meeting of the Standing Committee of Council on City
Finance and Services, Vancouver City Council supported a series of nightlife
actions and recommendations stemming from a staff report entitled “Update on
Liquor Policy Implementation and Upgrading the Granville Entertainment
District”. These included an amendment directing staff, as part of the City’s
Creative City Strategy, to establish a “Nightlife Council” that combines safety,
security, transportation, economic development, and vibrant street life, as well as
integrating lessons learned from the Granville Entertainment District Safety and
Security Working Group;
14. Vancouver City Staff, in collaboration with students from Simon Fraser University
and input from the VEC, recently commissioned a literature review and
jurisdictional scan of Vancouver’s nightlife economy, identifying the key themes
of transportation, safety, access, and nightlife development, while acknowledging
that the scope of the project was limited to nightlife, and not to the broader
Nighttime economy, with recommendations for further investigation of the city’s
night economy;
15. The Nighttime Economy is more than just entertainment, leisure, and social
events, it encompasses cultural, retail, tourism, and various corporate sectors, as
well as nighttime workers who do not work in nightlife venues (e.g., health care
workers, first responders, and police);
16. At the September 21, 2018, Public Meeting of the Mayors’ Council on Regional
Transportation, TransLink staff reported on the NightBus service, including
discussion of TransLink’s engagement with the Province on ride-hailing, and
TransLink’s interest in partnering with ride-hailing services – particularly for first
mile/last mile and late night services;
17. TransLink – at the recommendation of its Late Night Stakeholder Committee –
recently piloted the NightBus service from a central hub located on West Georgia
Street at Granville, where patrons can wait comfortably in a central, well-lit
environment to help improve safety along the busy GED nightlife corridor, amid
frequent calls for extended SkyTrain service hours and ride-hailing options;
18. In June of this year, TransLink will be releasing a report on late night
transportation that will look at a range of seamless transit options for Metro
Vancouver residents to return safely to their communities;

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, June 26 and 27, 2019 10
19. Ride-hailing has yet to become legal in British Columbia, and despite legislation
introduced by the provincial government on November 19, 2018, that will
ostensibly allow ride-hailing companies to enter the B.C. market in the fall of
2019, it remains to be seen how, when, where, and if ride-hailing will arrive and
whether it can thrive and succeed in B.C.;
20. Cities such as Sydney and London have adopted night-time strategic plans, while
other cities have created dedicated commissions and staff and global cities
around the world are generally adopting strategic measures to grow their
Nighttime economies to create local jobs and support a wide range of economic
activity;
21. Despite the City of Vancouver’s ongoing interest (past and present) in developing
the potential of the city’s Nighttime Economy, obstacles and impediments
continue to exist, not the least of which relate to transportation, public safety,
access, and regulatory restrictions, and the City lacks a comprehensive
overarching strategic policy framework that could bring the fullness of the city’s
Nighttime Economy into focus.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT the current Vancouver City Council – sworn in on November 5, 2018 –
affirm its unequivocal support for realizing the full economic potential of a
Nighttime Economy and the role it can and does play in a strong, diverse local
economy, one that supports small businesses and jobs, the local arts and culture
sectors, and the goal for Vancouver to be a sustainable, liveable city with
opportunities for everyone.
B. THAT Vancouver City Council direct staff to work with the Vancouver Economic
Commission to develop recommendations for a comprehensive citywide
Nighttime Economy Strategy, one that encompasses all aspects of the Nighttime
Economy and serves to focus the range of necessary actions required by Council
and the City to remove obstacles and impediments to realizing the economic and
other potentials of Vancouver’s Nighttime Economy, in consultation with all
appropriate stakeholders, with work to begin in 2020, and for a draft strategy to
be presented to Council for its consideration on or before June 2021;
FURTHER THAT Vancouver City Council direct staff to apply a child, youth, and
families’ lens in formulating recommendations for a comprehensive Nighttime
Economy Strategy to ensure that family-friendly, substance-free events and
street activations that foster social connectedness are included and well-
represented in the strategy; and
FURTHER THAT Vancouver City Council direct staff to apply a gender diversity
and inclusion lens in formulating recommendations for a comprehensive
Nightime Economy Strategy to consider issues of safety generally, but also
specifically for women and the LGBTQ2S+ community, as well as accessibility for
people with disabilities.
C. THAT Vancouver City Council affirm its support for a regional Night Transit
Strategy that seamlessly connects Metro Vancouver communities, in support of
the Vancouver and regional Nighttime Economies, including affirming Council’s
support for TransLink to explore transit options for Metro Vancouver residents to

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, June 26 and 27, 2019 11
return safely to their communities whether that be within the City of Vancouver or
for residents of Surrey, Burnaby, Coquitlam, Richmond and other Metro
Vancouver municipalities or for underserved residents of the UBC Endowment
Lands.

AMENDMENT MOVED by Councillor Swanson
THAT the third paragraph in B be amended to add the words “people who are homeless
and low income people” after the words “LGBTQ2S+ community”; and
FURTHER THAT the motion be amended to add D as follows:
THAT staff be directed to consider any potential impacts of recommendations on
existing businesses serving low-income residents and on the potential
displacement of low income residents and include this analysis in the final report
to Council to inform deliberations on the proposed strategy.

sectors, and the goal for Vancouver to be a sustainable, liveable city with
opportunities for everyone.
B. THAT Vancouver City Council direct staff to work with the Vancouver Economic
Commission to develop recommendations for a comprehensive citywide
Nighttime Economy Strategy, one that encompasses all aspects of the Nighttime
Economy and serves to focus the range of necessary actions required by Council
and the City to remove obstacles and impediments to realizing the economic and
other potentials of Vancouver’s Nighttime Economy, in consultation with all
appropriate stakeholders, with work to begin in 2020, and for a draft strategy to
be presented to Council for its consideration on or before June 2021;
FURTHER THAT Vancouver City Council direct staff to apply a child, youth, and
families’ lens in formulating recommendations for a comprehensive citywide
Nighttime Economy Strategy to ensure that family-friendly, substance-free events
and street activations that foster social connectedness are included and well-
represented in the strategy; and
FURTHER THAT Vancouver City Council direct staff to apply a gender diversity
and inclusion lens in formulating recommendations for a comprehensive citywide
Nighttime Economy Strategy to consider issues of safety generally, but also
specifically for women and the LGBTQ2S+ community, people who are homeless
and low income people, as well as accessibility for people with disabilities.
C. THAT Vancouver City Council affirm its support for a regional Night Transit
Strategy that seamlessly connects Metro Vancouver communities, in support of
the Vancouver and regional Nighttime Economies, including affirming Council’s
support for TransLink to explore transit options for Metro Vancouver residents to
return safely to their communities whether that be within the City of Vancouver or
for residents of Surrey, Burnaby, Coquitlam, Richmond and other Metro
Vancouver municipalities or for underserved residents of the UBC Endowment
Lands.
D. THAT staff be directed to consider any potential impacts of a comprehensive
citywide Nighttime Economy Strategy on existing businesses serving low-income
residents and on the potential displacement of low income residents and include
this analysis in the final report to Council to inform deliberations on the proposed
strategy.

THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. In 2015, following several days of Public Hearings, Vancouver City Council
approved licensing rules for medical-cannabis dispensaries, including the
creation of an exclusion zone in the Downtown Eastside where marijuana sales
are prohibited except for sites with a property line on Hastings Street or Main
Street;
2. The City’s intention in creating an exclusion zone in the Downtown Eastside in
2015 was to limit the proximity of dispensaries to youth and vulnerable
populations;
3. On October 17, 2018, the federal Cannabis Act came into effect, making
recreational cannabis legal in Canada;

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, June 26 and 27, 2019 16
4. Prior to the October 17, 2018 legalization of cannabis in Canada, i.e., in
June 2018, the federal government passed the bill to legalize recreational
cannabis in Canada, leading the provincial governments – including B.C. – to
implement new regulations for cannabis businesses to operate, and leading the
City of Vancouver to update its Zoning and Development and License by-laws to
ensure that Vancouver cannabis retailers operate in adherence to all regulations;
5. On December 20, 2018, a Special Meeting of Vancouver City Council was held
for the purpose of receiving a report from the Mayor’s Overdose Emergency Task
Force and to consider recommendations for immediate action on the overdose
crisis – recommendations Council unanimously supported;
6. On April 14, 2019, the City of Vancouver marked “the 1090th day since B.C.
declared the increase in overdose deaths as a public health emergency” by
declaring that the City would “fly the city’s flag at half-mast on this day each year
until B.C.’s provincial health officer rescinds the current state of public health
emergency.”;
7. Since April 14, 2016, more than 3,600 people have lost their lives to overdose in
B.C., with more than 1,000 of these deaths occurring in Vancouver, driven by an
increasingly toxic, unregulated drug supply that is contaminated by fentanyl,
carfentanil, and other contaminants;
8. Recent scientific findings have raised the possibility that cannabis might have a
beneficial role to play in the overdose crisis, with preliminary evidence linking
cannabis to reductions in the risk of experiencing drug-related harms, notably
through research conducted by UBC Professor M-J Milloy which showed that
among 2,500 hard drug users in the Downtown Eastside, cannabis helped
20 per cent to stay with treatment after a six-month period;
9. Vancouver City Council and the City of Vancouver generally support the
exploration of studies related to the opioid overdose crisis facing the city and the
role of cannabis in potentially addressing the situation, including two related
actions in the Mayor’s Emergency Overdose Task Force currently underway;
10. The CBC quotes Dr. Keith Ahamad, Medical Director for the Regional Addiction
Program at Vancouver Coastal Health, an addiction medicine clinician at
St. Paul’s Hospital, and a clinical researcher with the B.C. Centres on Substance
Use, as stating that the Downtown Eastside exclusion zone makes no sense
from a public health point of view and that the City’s “… current drug policy… is
obviously not working and actually worsening harm. It’s literally bad drug policy.”;
11. Health workers, addiction experts, and others working on the frontlines of the
Downtown Eastside have reported that the situation on the Downtown Eastside
has become much more dire since 2015, and have suggested that the exclusion
zone created by the City of Vancouver in 2015 has only served to further
stigmatize the Downtown Eastside instead of protecting its vulnerable population,
leaving people at the epicentre of the opioid crisis with no low-cost, legal options
if they want to use cannabis as an alternative to more dangerous drugs;
12. High Hopes Social Enterprise (HHSE), an organization that seeks to increase the
general well-being of the DTES community and support the sustainability and
resilience of its community and residents, has identified a need to enable low-

cost, legal cannabis options on the Downtown Eastside for the most vulnerable
people situated at the epicentre of the opioid crisis, people who may want to use
cannabis as an alternative to more dangerous drugs but cannot afford market
retail prices as stipulated by the province;
13. The Vancouver Overdose Prevention Society and High Hopes Social Enterprise
(HHSE) make note of support for low-cost, legal cannabis options on the
Downtown Eastside (potentially on the model of a community cannabis store with
a social enterprise and research focus), from, among others:
• Professor Evan Wood, MD, PhD, FRCPC, ABAM Dip, FASAM; Professor of
Medicine, UBC; Canada Research Chair in Inner City Medicine; Director,
British Columbia Centre on Substance Use; and Executive Director of the
British Columbia Centre on Substance Use (BCCSU).
• Professor M-J Milloy, PhD, Canopy Growth professor of cannabis science,
Assistant professor, Department of Medicine, University of British Columbia;
Research scientist, British Columbia Centre on Substance Use; New
Investigator, Canadian Institutes of Health Research; Scholar, Michael Smith
Foundation for Health Research.
• Dr. Mark Tyndall, Executive Medical Director BC Centre for Disease Control
14. All cannabis retail stores require a Provincial licence to operate and are regulated
and enforced by the BC Liquor and Cannabis Regulation Branch under the
Cannabis Control and Licensing Act;
15. There are currently four cannabis retail locations in the Downtown Eastside with
approved Development Permits, all of which will be eligible and expected to
apply for a provincial cannabis retail licence to operate as legal cannabis stores:
• 529 E Hastings Street (Hastings and Jackson St)
• 151 E Hastings Street (Hastings between Main and Columbia)
• 369 Columbia Street (Hastings and Columbia)
• 231 Abbott Street (Abbott and Cordova);
16. In order for the four cannabis retail locations noted above, all of which have
received Development Permits from the City, to proceed to the license application
phase with the provincial government, they will be required to close with no
guarantee that they will be granted a license or any clear indication as to the
timeframe for any license that may ultimately be issued, leaving the Downtown
Eastside without any retail cannabis locations for those who may wish to use
cannabis as an alternative to more dangerous drugs;
17. Despite the legalization of recreational marijuana in Canada, and regulatory
structures in place provincially and at the City of Vancouver, there does not
appear to be a regulatory option available that would enable low-cost, legal
cannabis (potentially on the model of a community cannabis store with a social
enterprise and research focus) for the Downtown Eastside and its most
vulnerable residents who may want to use cannabis as an alternative to opiates
and more dangerous drugs;

18. The City of Vancouver’s recent April 14, 2019 News Release (“Vancouver
mourns the lives lost to overdose on third-year anniversary of B.C.’s public health
emergency”) states: “The City is committed to addressing the issues that further
exacerbate the struggles around substance use. A comprehensive approach to
illicit substance use including prevention, harm reduction and treatment, will save
so many lives. We call upon health professionals, all levels of government, and
the public to join us in advocating for a safe drug supply, in Vancouver and
elsewhere in Canada, to protect residents and prevent any more unnecessary
deaths.”
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Vancouver City Council direct staff to make recommendations to Council
with respect to Section 11 of the City of Vancouver Zoning and Development
By-law with proposals on how this zoning by-law could be amended to allow
well-considered exceptions to the City’s current prohibition on Cannabis Stores in
the Downtown Eastside exclusion zone, consistent with the City’s commitment to
a comprehensive approach to illicit substance use, including prevention, harm
reduction, treatment, and addressing the issues that exacerbate the struggles
around substance use, and consistent with the dire, well-recognized nature of the
opioid crisis and the immense, devastating impact it is having on the people of
the City’s Downtown Eastside in particular;
FURTHER THAT Vancouver City Council direct staff to engage with the Liquor
and Cannabis Regulation Branch (LCRB) to indicate Vancouver City Council’s
desire to address unintended aspects of the City’s current Zoning and
Development By-law as it pertains to facilitating well-considered exceptions to
the City’s Zoning and Development By-law in relation to cannabis Stores in the
city, as well as engagement around the province’s regulatory processes for
licensing cannabis retail stores.
B. THAT Vancouver City Council direct staff to make urgent recommendations to
Council with respect to regulatory options and potential pathways that could
enable low-cost, legal cannabis options for the Downtown Eastside (potentially
on the model of a community cannabis store with a social enterprise and
research focus) for those people who may want to use cannabis as an alternative
to opiates and more dangerous drugs but cannot afford the market retail prices
stipulated by provincial regulations for a cannabis retail store.

The Committee heard from two speakers in support of the motion.

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, June 26 and 27, 2019 24
MOVED by Councillor Boyle
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. Public libraries require continuous and increasing investment to provide
opportunities for life-long learning, increase equity and social inclusion, and
create cities that are healthier and more affordable;
2. Provincial funding for public libraries has declined in the past decade as a portion
of total revenue allocated to individual BC library systems, from 7% to 4.6%,
while the municipal portion has risen from 72% to 80%;
3. This decline in provincial funding reflects a regressive approach of shifting cost to
municipal property tax payers.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT the Mayor, on behalf of Vancouver City Council, write a letter to
Minister Fleming asking that the BC Government restore library funding to a
minimum of $20 million annually to reflect inflationary and population increases
and recommit to a progressive funding approach, reflecting the role of public
libraries in achieving the goals of the Province and our communities.
B. THAT this motion be forwarded to Union of BC Municipalities (UBCM), asking
that UBCM strongly advocate that the BC Government restore library funding to a
minimum of $20 million annually to reflect inflationary and population increases
and recommit to a progressive funding approach, reflecting the role of public
libraries in achieving the goals of the Province and our communities.

5. Transparent Process and Taxation for Land Banks Repurposed as Temporary
Recreational Properties
The Committee heard from one speaker in support and one speaker in opposition to the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Fry
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. Over the past decade, vacant land development holdings throughout the City of
Vancouver have been converted to use as public recreation space, variously as
temporary parks and gardens;
2. As a result of installing temporary public parks or gardens, the respective lots are
reclassified by the BC Assessment Authority from Class 6 (Business, other) to
Class 8 (Recreation);
3. The City of Vancouver has the authority to determine land use, but has no
authority under the BC Assessment Act to determine property classification.
Property classification is done by BC Assessment in accordance with the BC
Assessment Act;
4. Property classifications by BC Assessment do not necessarily align with the
City’s land use policies. Unless the Assessment Act is amended, class
conversions are really a land use enforcement issue;
5. Reclassification from Class 6 to 8 nets significant property tax savings of nearly
two-thirds. In 2019 for example, the mill rate on Class 6 is $9.32931 per $1,000
assessed value; for Class 8, the mill rate is $3.86290 per $1,000 assessed value;

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, June 26 and 27, 2019 26
6. While these new temporary recreation spaces might impart some public
community benefit, they also impart significant financial benefit to the owners of
development holdings and may unfairly shift the tax burden to other property
owners;
7. In a February 17, 2009 motion Council directed staff to report back on context
and number of temporary recreation spaces on the whole, as well as options for
Council to consider in order to ensure a fair taxation model;
8. Typically the physical conversion of a property from Class 6 to Class 8 would
require property owners to apply for a development permit and a change of use
however this has not necessarily been the practice with land bank to public
recreation space conversions as described;
9. In a May 25, 2009 memo replying to council direction, City staff presented
options that considered maintaining the status quo; appealing BC Assessments
classifications; or requiring either strict or conditional approvals on development
applications to convert land from a business (Class 6) to recreational (Class 8)
property use;
10. The de facto decision at the time of that memo and since then has been to
maintain the status quo.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to review analysis in the memo from May 25, 2009 and
report back to Council on the feasibility of a hybrid system of strict enforcement
and conditional conversions of the use from business (Class 6) to recreational
(Class 8) uses that considers highest and best use of land, public benefits, and
potential tax revenue.
B. THAT Council direct staff in its report back to present criteria to define basic
standards of conditional conversion including but not limited to
commercialization, advertising, public access, and community benefits.
C. THAT Council direct staff to engage the Province and BC Assessment through
the inter-governmental working group to clarify and, where necessary, amend the
criteria for conversion with the goal of reducing/eliminating potential abuse of the
system.
D. THAT Council direct staff to report back on the above recommendations and any
necessary by-law amendments and considerations before end of Q4 2019.

MOVED by Councillor Hardwick
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. Through their own emissions and emissions from their products, 90 entities
(primarily fossil fuel companies) are collectively responsible for almost two thirds
of human-caused greenhouse gases
(https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-013-0986-y);
2. To deal with sea-level rise alone, the City of Vancouver expects to pay $1 billion,
and Metro Vancouver municipalities as a whole $9.5 billion, between now and
2100 (Vancouver Courier, Vancouver Sun);
3. To mitigate the effects of climate change and to help limit global warming to
1.5°C, Vancouver has adopted a Climate Emergency Response, which includes
funding its own target of being carbon neutral before 2050 as well as “helping
developing jurisdictions transition to renewable energy” (Climate Emergency
Response, p. 8);
4. Fossil fuel companies have not had to pay or be accountable for their share of
the damage that communities and municipalities, including Vancouver, must now
pay to prepare for and recover from;
5. BC has enacted legislation that holds opioid and tobacco producers liable for
health care costs and could do the same for fossil fuel producers (Tobacco
Damages and Health Care Costs Recovery Act and Opioid Damages and Health
Care Costs Recovery Act);
6. Over 20 municipalities and regional districts in BC have sent letters:
a. to Provincial and Federal governments to push for legislation to hold fossil
fuel producers strictly liable for climate-related harms if the producer is
responsible for greenhouse gas emissions at a globally detectable level;
and/or
b. to 20 of the world’s largest fossil fuel companies asking that these
companies pay a fair share of local costs, referencing climate impacts
including, but not limited to, sea level rise, infrastructure changes, and
increased wildfire, and the percent responsible according to their percent
of emissions calculated in the 2013 paper “Tracing Anthropogenic Carbon
Dioxide and Methane Emissions to Fossil Fuel and Cement Producers,
1854-2010” (updated by the author to 2013).
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT the Mayor, on behalf of Council, write to Canada’s Minister of Environment
and Climate Change and BC’s Minister of Environment and Climate Change
Strategy to request that they enact legislation holding fossil fuel companies liable
for climate-related harms caused by their contributions to climate change,
providing Ontario’s “Liability for Climate Related Harms” Bill as sample
framework.

the highest percentage of greenhouse gas emissions to ask that they be
accountable for their share of climate emergency costs-templates and letters
sent by other municipalities are available online.
C. THAT the Mayor, on behalf of Council, reach out to local governments in BC and
across Canada (including Victoria and Toronto) to investigate cooperation and
partnership, including potential shared legal strategies, to recover local climate-
related costs associated with the products of global fossil fuel companies.
D. THAT Council support calls in the Union of BC Municipality motions for:
a. sending climate accountability letters to the 20 largest fossil fuel
companies; and/or

2. UBCM Motion – Conflict of Interest Rules
At this point in the proceedings, the Mayor stepped down as Chair to introduce the motion.
Councillor Bligh as Deputy Mayor assumed the Chair.
MOVED by Mayor Stewart
SECONDED by Councillor Carr
WHEREAS when an elected official or senior staff leaves their municipal role and takes
a new role with a private firm that does business with the municipality it undermines the
public’s trust in the elected official or senior staff member. Elected officials and senior
civil servants have valuable knowledge and relationships that can potentially create
unfair and profitable advantage for new employers simply because of the position they
currently occupy with the City;
AND WHEREAS Conflict of interest rules improve public confidence in municipal
governance. Many municipal codes of conduct prohibit individuals from relaying
confidential information for the purpose of securing a private benefit for themselves or for
any other person, and requires avoidance of voting on issues when they personally think
they are in conflict, but does not address conflict of interest post-employment or for
family members and On December 12, 2018 Vancouver City Council resolved to ask its
staff to report back on how Vancouver can improve its current Conflict of Interest Policy
concerning elected officials and senior staff, and resolved to bring this issue to UBCM.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT the Union of BC Municipalities encourage other
municipalities to consider adopting Conflict of Interest rules.
