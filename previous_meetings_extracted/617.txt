B. Council Members’ Motions
1. Keeping the Public in the Information Loop
MOVED by Councillor Swanson
SECONDED by Councillor Hardwick
WHEREAS
1. City staff sometimes report out on information requested by City Council using a
memo, for example, a memo about the social housing definition and a memo
about recalibrating the Housing Vancouver Strategy;
2. The memo goes to Council members and not the general public;
3. The general public then doesn’t have access to the information and analysis that
staff have provided in a timely manner; and
4. Members of the public sometimes assume that this information hasn’t been
provided to Council.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Vancouver City Council direct staff to put non in-
camera memos that are responses to council motions in the Thursday media roundups
that happen after council meetings and/or report back by Q3 on process changes to
include faster public release of non in-camera memos.

CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY
2. Keys to Housing Affordability
At 4:32 pm, Councillor De Genova raised a point of order, under Section 8.7 of the Procedure
By-law, noting the motion might be frivolous as there is already work happening towards
housing affordability as a result of previous Council Members’ Motions. After consulting with
staff, the Mayor ruled in favour of Councillor De Genova’s point of order and ruled the motion
entitled “Keys to Housing Affordability”, out of order.
In order to introduce and answer questions on Council Members’ Motion 3, Mayor Stewart
relinquished the Chair to Deputy Mayor Boyle until the completion of the item.
3. Toward Reconciliation: Renaming Trutch Street
MOVED by Mayor Stewart
SECONDED by Councillor De Genova
WHEREAS
1. The City of Vancouver has a North-South street in Kitsilano named after Joseph
Trutch called Trutch Street;
2. Joseph Trutch was an English-born engineer and surveyor who served as the
Chief Commissioner of Lands and Works under Governor Frederick Seymour
and the first Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia;
3. Joseph Trutch was a racist and the chief architect of racist policies which inflicted
immense and long-standing harm to First Nations People;
4. Trutch championed a colonial government policy which denied First Nations’ title
to their lands, blocked their right to acquire lands held by non-Indigenous
residents, and massively reduced previously established reserve boundaries
- effectively establishing a 10-acre (40,000 m2) maximum reserve size;
5. The City of Vancouver became a City of Reconciliation in 2014 and promises to
review Vancouver’s colonial and racist past as well as make changes to reflect a
reconciled relationship with First Nations People; and

ENQUIRIES AND OTHER MATTERS
1. Extreme Heat Weather Response and Its Impact on the City’s Budget
Councillor De Genova enquired if there is any information that could be shared publicly on
whether the City has set aside resources in order to allocate towards combatting extreme heat
and weather, which the city has been dealing with for the past two weeks. The City Manager
noted that the City has a significant heat response, and the City is able to manage the resource
requirements within the City’s existing budget. The City Manager also noted that the City will be
conducting a comprehensive review of the heat response, in light of the extreme events in the
past couple of weeks, and there may be additional measures going forward that may have a
budget impact; however, at this time, the financial impact of the weather experienced in the
summer is being met. The City Manager confirmed that there is no line item allocated for
dealing with extreme heat, but it would be observed within departmental operating budgets, and
if these budgets would run over, then the money allocated would come from contingency
budgets.

2. Concerns with Lighting on Patios
Councillor Fry expressed the restaurant industry’s concerns with adequate lighting on patios
and enquired for a response back from staff on potentially having wired lighting for patios,
similarly to the covered wires cutting across sidewalks for electric vehicle charging stations, as
the solar lighting does not provide enough lighting at times. The City Manager agreed to follow-
up with Engineering Services staff and to provide a response.
3. Update on the City’s Emergency Planning Work
Councillor Dominato noted that staff are currently reviewing the City’s Emergency Preparedness
Response Plan and enquired on whether it would be possible to have a report back on lessons
learned around the pandemic, as well as heat wave response, and for it to be made publicly
available. The City Manager noted that staff has previously provided a yearly update on the City
emergency planning work; however, due to the pandemic this report back did not happen last

year, however staff is planning to bring a report back to Council on this matter in the coming
year.
4. City’s Role in Strata Buildings Maintenance Safety Inspections
Councillor Dominato noted the recent building collapse in Florida, and enquired for a response
from staff on what measures does the City take, and what role does the City play in building
maintenance safety, especially in older strata buildings, and if there is a regulatory review in
light of what happened in Florida. The City Manager noted that the City inspects SRO buildings,
however, it would be too great of an undertaking to provide that for all strata buildings in the city.
The City Manager agreed to follow-up with staff and provide a response.
5. Update on the City’s Lobbyist Registry
Councillor Dominato enquired for a status update on the City’s Lobbyist Registry. The City
Manager noted there is no ongoing work on this matter, as the City currently does not have the
jurisdiction to implement a mandatory lobbyist registry.
6. Update on the Appointment of the City’s Integrity Commissioner
Concillor Dominato enquired for a status update on the formal appointment of the Integrity
Commissioner. The City Manager noted that recommendations will be coming to Council in the
