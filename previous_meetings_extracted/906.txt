6. Revisiting the Random Ballot for Equity’s Sake
The registered speaker was not present in the Council Chamber.
MOVED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. Barriers in the electoral system can contribute to reduced voter participation;
2. One of the goals of the Healthy City Strategy is to increase voter turn-out, which
is a common proxy for measuring democracy, and the City is actively working on
the development of an Equity Framework;
3. In April 2018, Vancouver City Council voted to list Mayoral, Council and Park
Board Commissioner candidates in random order instead of alphabetical order
on Vancouver’s next municipal election in October that year. This was purported
to create a more even playing field for candidates. A by-law was subsequently
enacted by Council per the provisions of Section 79 of the Vancouver Charter;

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, July 24, 2019 5
4. The April 2018 Taking the ABCD Bias off the Ballot Motion suggested that
alphabetical bias in the ballot has a particularly negative impact on people who
have last names that are Chinese, South Asian, Vietnamese, Korean, Japanese
or Latino - among others; however, cultural representation actually decreased
following the 2018 election that used a random order ballot;
5. It has been suggested that switching from an alphabetically ordered to a random
order ballot could eliminate order bias. However, 60% of Councillors elected in
October 2018 appeared in the first one-third of the one-version random ballot,
indicating that one order bias was changed for another;
6. Voters cited confusion and inertia at the overwhelming ballot length and random
form for the October 2018 Vancouver municipal election;
7. In November 2018, Council directed staff to prepare a 2018 Municipal Election
Review report to Council by May 2019 including but not limited to such factors as
the efficacy of the random ballot, with the goal of supporting strong voter turnout
and confidence in the electoral process. Voter turnout in 2018 was 39% vs 43.4%
in 2014 not achieving the City’s goal of increasing civic participation;
8. The 2018 Municipal Election Review report indicated that random order ballots
were cited as more personally confusing by Chinese, South Asian and minority
voters compared to Caucasian voter survey respondents;
9. The same post-election survey indicated that Caucasian respondents were
significantly more likely to prefer random order ballots, compared to Chinese,
South Asian and minority respondents.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council acknowledge that the 2018 Municipal Election Review
report indicated that random order ballots were cited as more confusing
by Chinese, South Asian and minority residents, and that given the goal
of equity as well as increasing voter turnout, it is prudent to reconsider the
use of an alphabetical vs. a random order ballot for the next Vancouver
municipal election as permitted by Sections 78 and 79 of the Vancouver
Charter.
B. THAT Council direct staff to engage with appropriate Resident Advisory
Committees for their feedback on the use of an alphabetical vs random
order ballot, including the Racial and Ethno-Cultural Equity Advisory
Committee, Urban Indigenous People’s Advisory Committee, Persons
with Disabilities Advisory Committee, and Seniors Advisory Committee.
C. THAT staff report back to Council by Q1 2020 with Committee feedback
and recommendations related to whether or not to return to an
alphabetically ordered ballot for the next Vancouver municipal election,
including possible recommendations for by-law enactment per the
provisions of Section 79 of the Vancouver Charter.

Seniors Advisory Committee, with the goal of identifying a ballot that achieves
equity and effectiveness;
FURTHER THAT B be amended to strike and replace it with the following:
FURTHER THAT such review include consideration of ease and clarity of
alphabetical vs random ballot types, as well as the benefits and drawbacks of
strategies such as numbering candidates on a randomized ballot, or having
multiple randomized lots of ballots vs just one random version;

7. Ending Sexual Harassment and Violence in Vancouver’s Hospitality and Service
Industries
The Committee heard from six speakers in support of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Boyle
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. The safety of women in the workplace remains a top priority for the City of
Vancouver;
2. The City of Vancouver has engaged in a variety of ways to strengthen women’s
equity, including through the creation of a Women’s Equity Strategy, unanimously
adopted;
3. In 2018, the City of Vancouver joined UN Women’s Global Flagship Initiative,
“Safe Cities and Safe Public Spaces” (“UN Women Safe Cities”);
4. Vancouver City Council recognizes that safe and healthy workplaces help attract
and retain families, and individuals to live and work in the city;
5. The City of Vancouver recognizes and supports the growth of the #MeToo
Movement across North America, the human rights of Women, and the need to
ensure workplaces in hospitality and service industries are free from sexual
assault and harassment;
6. The City of Victoria recently passed a motion to require, among other things,
sexual violence prevention training in the local service industry to ensure a
harassment-free environment;
7 Recent sexual harassment and sexual assault complaints have been raised at
luxury hotels in Vancouver;
8. Sexual assault reports in Vancouver rose more than 16 per cent since 2016,
even as rates of other violent crime decreased or remained steady. Nearly 400 of
the 1,431 reported assaults over the past three-years came from the central
business district, which includes the Granville strip and other nightlife areas1;
9. The City of Vancouver has been concerned in the past with the high rate of crime
and sexual assault in the Granville Entertainment District;
10. Good Night Out Vancouver was formed in response to high rates of crime and
sexual violence in the Central Business District, and Vancouver City Council
recently approved additional funding for Good Night Out Vancouver to continue
their important education and intervention work, and to build their fundraising
capacity;
11. The City of Vancouver has invested greatly in developing a Nighttime Economy,
including passing a recent motion to create “A Comprehensive Strategy for
Realizing the Full Potential of the Nighttime Economy in the City of Vancouver”.
This work includes keeping the safety of the local workforce in mind, particularly

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, July 24, 2019 8
as women constitute a majority of workers in hotels, restaurants and bars and
commonly experience sexual harassment in these industries;
12. Attracting greater numbers of tourists and local residents to our downtown social
district can yield greater nightlife vibrancy and economic growth, and it can place
demands on public safety and create additional risks for vulnerable people,
including service and hospitality staff.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Vancouver City Council direct staff to report to
Council on recommendations and actions to ensure the safety of women working in the
service and hospitality industry, with a specific focus on the Granville Entertainment
District and Vancouver’s luxury hotels. In the development of this report Council direct
staff to:
i. Meet with downtown hotel/restaurant owners, related association, service
worker advocate groups (unions and community advocates) to formulate
recommendations on how to combat the growth of sexual violence in
Vancouver’s hospitality and service industries and in the workplace;
ii. Explore ways to end sexual violence in the city, including in Vancouver
hotels, restaurants and bars, as part of its work on the UN Women Safe
Cities work and the upcoming nighttime economy strategy;
iii. Report back with implications of and options for mandating sexualized
violence prevention training for hotel and restaurant staff as part of either
the liquor licence or business licence approval process; and
iv. Report back on options for conducting audits of venues to ensure the staff
and environment minimize risk of sexual violence incidents; including
working toward a common policy for business operators that establishes
a best practices standard for conduct.

8. Eliminating Generators: Greening Vancouver’s Film and Food Truck Industries
The Committee heard from four speakers in support of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Carr
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. Vancouver is the eighth global city to launch a C40 Women4Climate Mentorship
Program, coordinated by our city’s Sustainability Department and ZebX (Zero
Emission Buildings Centre of Excellence) and focused on initiatives that achieve
measurable reductions in local carbon pollution. One of our program participants
is Clara George, an award-winning Vancouver-based television and film
producer, whose short-term goal is to reduce carbon emissions generated by the
film industry through their use of diesel generators, with the long-term goal of
Vancouver becoming the most sustainable film production centre in the world,
with a blueprint that all filming centres can follow;
2. The Vancouver Economic Commission
(http://www.vancouvereconomic.com/film-television/) notes that Vancouver is the
third largest film and television production centre in North America, home to
approximately 65+ movies and 55+ TV series annually as well as hundreds of
other filming days for commercials, TV pilots and other features (407 productions
in 2016), generating 20,000 film and TV jobs in Vancouver, with a 2017 direct
spend in British Columbia of $3.8 billion including a payroll of $2.06 billion;

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, July 24, 2019 10
3. Vancouver’s supply of electricity is from BC Hydro, almost 97% of which is
generated from renewable energy—a clean, green source of power compared to
the diesel generators used by the film industry;
4. In 2018 there were an estimated 2,350 filming days in Vancouver, with each
filming day using at least one, and an average of 2-3 diesel generators. Each
generator uses, on average, 296 litres of diesel per filming day. Replacing diesel
generators with electrical plug-ins and other zero emissions options means a
potential reduction of 2,086,800 litres of diesel and their associated greenhouse
gas (GHG) emissions—about 5,500 tonnes of CO2e per year;
5. The City of Vancouver’s Greenest City Action Plan 2015-2020 and Renewable
City plan aim to reduce Vancouver’s GHG emissions by 50 percent from a 2007
baseline of 2,805,000 tCO2e by 2030 and eliminate dependence on fossil fuels
before 2050. These goals were strengthened by a unanimous vote of Council on
in January 2019 on the motion Ramping Up Vancouver’s Climate Action in
Response to the Climate Emergency;
6. Much of the filming activity and use of generators is concentrated around clusters
of prime filming locations and “on location” parking lots, many of which are on or
near city properties, and some of which are on School Board and Park Board
properties;
7. Diesel generators can be replaced through tie-ins to city buildings or the use of
electricity power drops, which can also be used as EV charging stations;
8. Reducing and replacing the use of diesel generators in the film industry would
not only help achieve the city’s climate action and GHG reduction objectives, but
would also contribute to a healthier and quieter city by reducing diesel
particulates and noise pollution;
9. Considering the film industry’s savings on reduced use of diesel fuel and their
desire to “green” their industry, the industry could help finance electricity power
drops and building tie-ins;
10. The City of Vancouver issues approximately 150 food truck permits annually.
Approximately 87 foot trucks use generators. The elimination of the generators
used by the food truck industry could save about 1,100 tonnes of CO2e per year.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT City Council direct staff to work with the film
industry to develop a plan that quickly reduces and aims to completely eliminate the use
of generators for filming and food trucks in Vancouver. Components of the plan should
include:
1. Identifying opportunities and challenges to obtaining electrical power to needed
areas;
2. Prioritizing high use filming locations for electricity power drops and building tie-
ins;
3. Coordinating with the city’s Electric Vehicle Ecosystem Strategy and REFM (Real
Estate and Facilities Management) Planning to assess potential locations that
can also be used as EV charging stations and for events, street festivals, food
trucks and other activities that currently use diesel generators;

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, July 24, 2019 11
4. Establishing actions and time-lines that facilitate the city meeting its GHG
reduction goals;
5. Identifying and pursuing policies around street closures that will reduce the
number of diesel generators needed for filming;
6. Working with the Vancouver Park Board to participate in this plan;
7. Encouraging the Vancouver School Board to develop a similar plan;
8. Developing a financing plan that leverages new revenue opportunities from the
film industry and possibly from low carbon fuel standard credits for the reductions
in GHG emissions;
9. Identifying any City by-laws and/or policies that may need to be updated to
accommodate the supply of electrical power by the City to the needed areas;
10. Work with the film industry to determine what actions would be required to
authentically brand Vancouver as the Greenest Film Production Centre in the
World, and include GHGs, waste, noise and water use on production sites and
report back to Council in 2020 on the outcomes; and
11. That staff pursue opportunities to reduce reliance on generators for curbside
power uses, specifically food trucks and special events, and report back on
actions and a timeline to align with the aim of eliminating reliance on generators.

MOVED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
SECONDED by Councillor Wiebe
WHEREAS
1. As with many cities around the world, Vancouver has aging infrastructure that
has been deteriorating at a rate more rapid than renewal investment, while
pressures this aging infrastructure, combined with increased population density
and development intensity, climate change and sea level rise, and increased
regulations around environmental water quality, are having particularly significant
impacts on the City’s water, sewer, and drainage utility infrastructure;
2. The waterworks and sewer infrastructure of cities play an important role in
ensuring sustainability and resiliency by using water efficiently, by being aware of
what goes into the sewers, and by recognizing how local waterways can be
affected by sewage and storm water overflows;
3. The City of Vancouver’s Greenest City Action Plan, among others, embodies the
City’s aspiration to be on the leading edge of urban sustainability and resiliency
through a set of measurable and attainable targets;
4. The City of Vancouver has 2,117 km of sewer and drainage mains, as well as 24
pump stations, approximately 90,000 sewer connections, 45,000 catch basins,
and roughly 200 green infrastructure features, with an estimated replacement
value of $6.1 billion;
5. The bulk of Vancouver’s original wastewater and rainwater systems, which date
to the late 19th and early 20th centuries, were built with combined sewer pipes
that channel a mixture of rainwater, groundwater, and sewage through a single
sewer pipe;

Minutes, Wednesday, July 24, 2019 3
6. Combined sewer pipes cannot handle all storm water runoff during periods of
prolonged or heavy rain, resulting in sewers that overflow and discharge raw
sewage into local waterways such as Burrard Inlet, English Bay, and the Fraser
River from a network of combined sewer outfalls along the city’s shorelines;
7. Raw sewage from combined sewer overflows, system cross-connections,
sewage discharge from boats and other sources are a major contributor to E.coli
and fecal contamination of public waterways;
8. The City of Vancouver has an on-going, multi-decade sewer capital program to
replace its combined sewer pipes with separated sewer pipes as part of renewal
and/or growth-triggered upgrades, which, in conjunction with targeted green
infrastructure, aims to reduce combined sewer overflows into Vancouver’s local
waterways, such as Burrard Inlet, English Bay, False Creek, and the Fraser
River, during heavy rain events, while providing increased sanitary capacity to
the sewer system to accommodate growth and directing rainwater to receiving
bodies that help reduce flooding concerns;
9. The City of Vancouver currently has both combined and separated areas in its
sewer systems. Some areas, such as Downtown, Still Creek and in the False
Creek Flats have the highest level of sewer separation;
10. Currently, Provincial Government regulations through the Integrated Liquid
Waste and Resource Management Plan requires the City of Vancouver to
eliminate combined sewer overflows by 2050 within a target rainfall event (1 in 5
year event);
11. In the 10 years from 2009 to 2018, the City of Vancouver reportedly replaced 83
km of combined sewers with 166 km of separated sewer mains, with separation
projects on major arterials such as Burrard, West 4th, Alma, Southwest Marine,
Dunbar, Nanaimo, and King Edward, as well as approximately 10,000 associated
sewer connections and replacement / refurbishment of 5 sewer pump stations;
12. As noted in the City of Vancouver 2019-2022 Capital Plan, over the past 10
years, sewer mains have been replaced at an annual rate of 0.6 percent of the
system, with approximately 50 percent of the combined sewer system now
replaced and separated;
13. On June 29, 2019, Sunset Beach was closed to swimming on the
recommendation of Vancouver Coastal Health due to high E.coli levels. It is not
clear which factors contributed to the high levels and such factors may or may
not have been combined sewer overflows, system cross-connections, boaters
discharging waste or other sources;
14. According to recent reports, almost 674,000 cubic metres of raw sewage and
runoff drained into False Creek last year from just one of the five False Creek
combined sewer overflow outfalls;
15. On May 30, 2017, the City of Vancouver established a waterfront initiative for
major natural waterways such as Burrard Inlet, False Creek, Lost Lagoon, the
Fraser River and Trout Lake, with improving water quality in False Creek as an
initial area of focus under the City’s waterfront initiative;

Minutes, Wednesday, July 24, 2019 4
16. On November 1, 2017, the City of Vancouver adopted the Rain City Strategy
vision and goals, which includes improving water quality and reducing pollutants
discharged in to our local waters from combined sewer overflows and rainwater
run-off through the implementation of green rainwater infrastructure;
17. In 2019, the City plans to advance the development of a hydraulic model of the
False Creek Basin to better understand its complex nature, including flow
dynamics, contaminant fate and water quality performance to assist the City in
identifying action priorities and evaluating potential benefits and continue to work
with First Nations and regional and senior governments to advance additional
action initiatives, including supporting the development of emerging technologies
and techniques to better identify the primary sources of fecal contamination in
False Creek;
18. Metro Vancouver’s Liquid Waste Services division, which provides wastewater
collection and treatment services and administers the region’s Integrated Liquid
Waste and Resource Management Plan (ILWRMP), under the Greater
Vancouver Sewerage & Drainage District (GVS&DD), lists “commencing work
with the Cities of Burnaby, New Westminster and Vancouver to identify options
and strategies to cost effectively eliminate combined sewer overflows and
separate combined sewers” as key action items for 2019;
19. According to Metro Vancouver, the 4-year average annual combined sewer
overflow volume for the region from 2013 to 2016 was 27,300 megalitres (from
combined sewers in Vancouver, Burnaby, and New Westminster), while in 2017
Metro Vancouver’s combined sewer overflow volume was 33,300 megalitres and
in 2018 it was 41,300 megalitres – with a 2019 target of 28,500 megalitres;
20. The 5-year average for the number of annual wet-weather related sanitary sewer
overflow (SSO) events from Metro Vancouver sewers from 2012 t0 2016 was 20
events and 39 events were reported in 2017;
21. The City of Vancouver’s $1.5 billion Operating Budget and Fiscal Plan for 2019
includes a sewer utility rate increase of 11.0% to (1) meet the increase in Metro
Vancouver (regional) rates, including costs for site preparation for secondary
treatment at Iona Island Wastewater Treatment Plant, (2) provide funding for
sewer capital projects, as outlined in the approved 2019-2022 Capital Plan, (3)
cover debt-servicing costs to support the replacement and separation of sewer
infrastructure to support the City’s goal to eliminate combined sewer overflows by
2050, and (4) allow for investments in flood mitigation and facility maintenance;
22. Metro Vancouver’s regional population growth estimates to the year 2050, based
on a base population of 2,570,000 in 2016, is anticipated to increase by about 1
million to 3,600,000 by the year 2050, with a corresponding increase in the
population of the City of Vancouver and similarly increased demands on the
City’s sewer systems and discharges of raw sewage into the city’s waterways.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Vancouver City Council direct staff to explore an
accelerated timeline for addressing the City’s combined sewer overflows, including (but
not limited to) potential costs, potential infrastructure funding partnerships and programs
(i.e., federal, provincial, regional, and/or in conjunction with other nearby municipalities),
potential pathways to cost-effectively achieve accelerated water quality outcomes
related to combined sewer overflow events by 2029, the potential impact of accelerating
