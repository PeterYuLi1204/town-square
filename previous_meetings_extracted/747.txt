WHEREAS

impacted vulnerable people experiencing homelessness or at risk of
homelessness, and supportive social services and emergency shelters that serve
these populations have had to reduce capacity due to COVID-19;

Special Council Meeting
Minutes, October 8, 2020 3
2. The impacts of COVID-19 now overlap with the overdose public health crisis,
creating two ongoing and potentially fatal health crises within Vancouver’s
communities;
3. The Federal Government has announced two new streams of emergency
housing funds: the Rapid Housing Initiative (RHI) and the expanded Reaching
Home program;
4. The Provincial Government has committed to delivering 1,500 units of social
housing in Vancouver, with accompanying operating services, and have moved
unsheltered residents from Oppenheimer Park into provincial social housing
units;
5. Despite these positive federal and provincial initiatives, no funding is immediately
available to the City of Vancouver to provide emergency COVID-19 relief for
unsheltered Vancouver residents;
6. Residents living in Strathcona, the West End, Yaletown, Crosstown, Gastown,
Chinatown, the Downtown Eastside, Mount Pleasant, and Grandview Woodlands
and other areas of the city are still experiencing higher-than-usual levels of street
homelessness and are demanding solutions in the form of services and housing
options for their vulnerable neighbours;
7. The staff memorandum to Council dated October 2, 2020, entitled “Response to
Council Motion: Emergency COVID-19 Relief for Unsheltered Vancouver
Residents (RTS: 014069)”, contains information and analysis on the feasibility of
options for housing the estimated 750 unsheltered residents living in Vancouver,
including cost, expediency, anticipated uptake, space attributes, likely
partnership with senior government, and potential impacts on the health and
housing outcomes; and
8. The staff memorandum determined the options that scored the highest across
costs, expediency, uptake, space attributes, and likely partnerships with senior
government were:
a. Vacant apartment buildings;
b. Vacant commercial hotels or other buildings; and/or,
c. Vacant single-room occupancy buildings.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
THAT, to provide emergency COVID-19 relief for unsheltered Vancouver residents,
Council will:
