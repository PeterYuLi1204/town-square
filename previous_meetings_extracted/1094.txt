Public Hearing
Minutes, Tuesday, December 12, 2017 6
CONDITIONS OF APPROVAL OF THE FORM OF DEVELOPMENT
(a) That the proposed form of development be approved by Council in
principle, generally as prepared by GBL Architecture Inc. on behalf of
the Vancouver Affordable Housing Agency (VAHA), and stamped
“Received Planning and Development Services (Rezoning Centre),
June 15, 2017”, provided that the Director of Planning may allow minor
alterations to this form of development when approving the detailed
scheme of development as outlined in (b) below.
(b) That, prior to approval by Council of the form of development, the
applicant shall obtain approval of a development application by the
Director of Planning, who shall have particular regard for the following:
Urban Design
1. Design development to provide an improved transition to the
surrounding context, in particular the single lot to the west and
to sites across the lane.
Note to Applicant: A substantial notch in the building massing at
the southwest corner should be provided to better transition to
the adjacent single lot. Four-storey shoulder setbacks should be
provided at the rear as a transition to future townhouse sites
across the lane.
2. Design development to respond to the unique site configuration
and curved geometry of Southwest Marine Drive.
Note to Applicant: The architectural and landscape design should
reflect the curvature of the street which may be achieved
through the design of the retaining walls in the front yard and
the building’s projecting balconies. The inner row of street
trees, required under Section 7.2.5 of the Marpole Community
Plan, should also follow the curvature of the street.
3. Design development to improve and provide additional common
amenity space.
Note to Applicant: Additional common indoor and outdoor
amenity space should be located at the south side for improved
solar access. It is recommended that the southern common
amenity space be located in conjunction with the main
residential entry to encourage social interaction. Delete large
overhangs at the rear yard amenity space noting that they are
not required due to the northern exposure and will further
compromise solar access.

Public Hearing
Minutes, Tuesday, December 12, 2017 7
4. Design development to ensure the underground parkade
structure does not project above the existing grades.
Note to Applicant: The building should not read as located on an
elevated plinth due to the parkade structure. The side yards
should be landscaped and the finished grades in the yards should
be compatible with existing grades at adjacent sites. This may
require further setbacks to the parkade structure to align with
the exterior walls of the building which may result in a reduction
in the proposed number of parking spaces, and/or modifications
to provide localized drops in the parkade roof slab. Adequate
soil depth should be provided at the roof of the parkade to
support planting in the side yards. Front patios may be located
above existing grades and contiguous with the main floor
elevation, with terraced retaining walls to transition to lower
sidewalk grades. Detail sections should be provided to confirm
the proposed finished grading, patios, retaining walls, and
planting and soil depth at parkade roofs in the front and side
yards.
5. Design development to provide more prominence for the front
entry.
Note to Applicant: The primary front entry should be
architecturally distinct and identifiable. Ground floor units
should have entries and patios oriented to the street to provide
an improved relationship to the public realm, noting that
Southwest Marine Drive is expected to evolve into a more
pedestrian friendly street with the development of projects
under the Marpole Community Plan.
6. Design development to provide high quality and durable exterior
finishes and details consistent with the rezoning application.
Note to Applicant: The intent is to provide quality in all aspects,
including but not limited to appearance, durability, and
performance. The materials and details, including the front
balconies design, should be consistent with the proposed
architectural expression.
7. The proposed unit mix, including 10 studios (19%), 15 one-bedroom
units (28%), 15 two-bedroom units (28%), and 13 three-bedroom
units (25%), is to be included in the Development Permit drawings.
Note to Applicant: Any changes in the unit mix from the rezoning
application may only be varied under the discretion of the
Director of Planning or Development Permit Board provided that
it does not go lower than 50% of the dwelling units designed to
be suitable for families with children.

Public Hearing
Minutes, Tuesday, December 12, 2017 8
8. Submission of a bird-friendly strategy for the design of the
building is encouraged in the application for a development
permit.
Note to Applicant: Refer to the Bird-Friendly Design Guidelines
for examples of built features that may be applicable. For more
information, see the guidelines at
http://former.vancouver.ca/commsvcs/guidelines/B021.pdf.
Crime Prevention through Environmental Design (CPTED)
9. Design development to respond to CPTED principles, having
particular regard for the following:
(i) theft in the underground parking;
(ii) residential break and enter;
(iii) mail theft; and
(iv) mischief in alcoves and vandalism, such as graffiti.
Landscape Design
10. Design development to increase the amount of common outdoor
area and expand programming by providing a second common
amenity area at the south side of the building to provide an
opportunity for sunnier orientation.
Note to Applicant: This should include relocating the urban
agriculture plots to the south side for better solar exposure.
Shared gardening areas should reference and be designed to
adhere to Council’s Urban Agriculture Guidelines for the Private
Realm and should provide maximum solar exposure, universal
accessibility and provided with amenities such as raised beds,
water for irrigation, potting bench, tool storage, and
composting.
11. Design development to the front yard to provide a transition
zone to the street, extend patios further out away from the
building cover, and realign the terraced retaining wall to follow
the curvature of the street.
Note to Applicant: Terraced walls should recall the site history
and respect the existing stone wall currently in front of 87
Southwest Marine Drive. This can be accomplished through the
use of a true stone masonry wall or an architectural concrete
wall.

Public Hearing
Minutes, Tuesday, December 12, 2017 9
12. Design development to provide a second row of street trees on
the inside boulevard, consistent with the Marpole Community
Plan, away from the parkade structure on free grade.
Note to Applicant: The parkade structure may need to be
setback or angled away from the edge to allow proper rootball
development. Street trees should be aligned to follow the
curvature of the sidewalk and street on private property.
13. Design development to delete awkward angular spaces created
by the parkade ramp turn at the property line (currently shown
as gravel) and integrate into the building.
Note to Applicant: This space, as shown, poses a CPTED concern.
14. Design development to improve the expression of the main entry
by provision of flanking planting beds on either side, containing
some colourful, friendly, woody evergreen shrubs.
15. Design development to provide a substantial landscape buffer at
the lane interface, oriented to the lane.
16. Design development to safely retain and protect west neighbour
tree (Tree #OS-2), or obtain written consent for removal from
the property owner.
Note to Applicant: This tree is currently in conflict with the
proposed building footprint, grades and paving. If arborist
supervision is sufficient to protect the tree during any work
within the Critical Root Zone of the tree, then a Letter of
Assurance for this is required, signed and dated by the arborist,
owner and contractor.
17. Design development to improve sustainability and expand
programming to include edible plants integrated into the
landscape design, in addition to urban agriculture plots.
Note to Applicant: Edible plants can be used as ornamentals as
part of the landscape design. Shared gardening areas should
reference and be designed to adhere to Council’s Urban
Agriculture Guidelines for the Private Realm and should provide
maximum solar exposure, universal accessibility and provided
with amenities such as raised beds, water for irrigation, potting
bench, tool storage and composting.

Public Hearing
Minutes, Tuesday, December 12, 2017 10
18. Provision of maximized tree growing medium and planting depths
for tree and shrub planters to ensure long-term viability of the
landscape.
Note to Applicant: Underground parking slabs and retaining walls
may need to be altered to provide adequate depth and
continuous soil volumes. Growing mediums and planting depths
should exceed BCSLA standard.
19. A full Landscape Plan for the proposed landscape is to be
submitted. The Landscape Plan should illustrate proposed plant
materials (with common and botanical names, plant sizes and
quantities), paving, walls, railings, light fixtures, site grading
and other landscape features. Plant material should be listed in
a Plant List that is clearly keyed to the Landscape Plan. The
Landscape Plan should be a minimum of 1:100 or 1/8” scale.
20. Section details at a minimum of 1/4”=1’ scale to illustrate
typical proposed landscape elements including planters on
structures, benches, fences, gates, arbours and trellises, and
other features. Planter section details must be dimensioned and
confirm depth of proposed planting on structures is deep enough
to accommodate rootballs of proposed trees well into the future.
21. Sections (1/4” = 1’ or 1:50) illustrating the building to public
realm interface facing the street, confirming a delineated
private to public transition of spaces.
Note to Applicant: The section should include the building
façade, as well as any steps, retaining walls, guardrails, fences
and planters. The location of the underground parking slab
should be included in the section.
22. Design development to locate, integrate and fully screen the
lane edge gas meters and parking garage vents in a manner
which minimizes their impact on the architectural expression
and the project’s open space and public realm.
23. New proposed street trees should be coordinated with the Park
Board and Engineering Services and noted “Final species,
quantity and spacing to the approval of City Engineer and Park
Board”. Contact Eileen Curran (604-871-6131) of Engineering
Streets Division regarding street tree spacing and quantity.

CONDITIONS OF APPROVAL OF THE FORM OF DEVELOPMENT
(a) That the proposed form of development be approved by Council in
principle, generally as prepared by GBL Architecture Inc. on behalf of
the Vancouver Affordable Housing Agency (VAHA), and stamped
“Received Planning and Development Services (Rezoning Centre),
June 15, 2017”, provided that the Director of Planning may allow minor
alterations to this form of development when approving the detailed
scheme of development as outlined in (b) below.
(b) That, prior to approval by Council of the form of development, the
applicant shall obtain approval of a development application by the
Director of Planning, who shall have particular regard for the following:
Urban Design
1. Design development to provide an improved transition to the
surrounding context, in particular the single lot to the east and
to sites across the lane.
Note to Applicant: A substantial notch in the building massing at
the southeast corner should be provided to better transition to
the adjacent single lot. Four-storey shoulder setbacks should be
provided at the rear as a transition to future townhouse sites
across the lane.
2. Design development to respond to the unique site configuration
and curved geometry of Southwest Marine Drive.
Note to Applicant: The architectural and landscape design should
reflect the curvature of the street which may be achieved
through the design of the retaining walls in the front yard and
the building’s projecting balconies. The inner row of street
trees, required under Section 7.2.5 of the Marpole Community
Plan, should also follow the curvature of the street.
3. Design development to improve and provide additional common
amenity space.
Note to Applicant: Additional common indoor and outdoor
amenity space should be located at the south side for improved
solar access. It is recommended that the southern common

Public Hearing
Minutes, Tuesday, December 12, 2017 21
amenity space be located in conjunction with the main
residential entry to encourage social interaction. Delete large
overhangs at the rear yard amenity space noting that they are
not required due to the northern exposure and will further
compromise solar access.
4. Design development to ensure the underground parkade
structure does not project above existing grades.
Note to Applicant: The building should not read as located on an
elevated plinth due to the parkade structure. The side yards
should be landscaped and the finished grades in the yards should
be compatible with existing grades at adjacent sites. This may
require further setbacks to the parkade structure to align with
the exterior walls of the building which may result in a reduction
in the proposed number of parking spaces, and/or modifications
to provide localized drops in the parkade roof slab. Adequate soil
depth should be provided at the roof of the parkade to support
planting in the side yards. Front patios may be located above
existing grades and contiguous with the main floor elevation,
with terraced retaining walls to transition to lower sidewalk
grades. Detail sections should be provided to confirm the
proposed finished grading, patios, retaining walls, and planting
and soil depth at parkade roofs in the front and side yards.
5. Design development to provide more prominence for the front
entry.
Note to Applicant: The primary front entry should be
architecturally distinct and identifiable. Ground floor units
should have entries and patios oriented to the street to provide
an improved relationship to the public realm, noting that
Southwest Marine Drive is expected to evolve into a more
pedestrian friendly street with the development of projects
under the Marpole Community Plan.
6. Design development to provide high quality and durable exterior
finishes and details consistent with the rezoning application.
Note to Applicant: The intent is to provide quality in all aspects,
including but not limited to appearance, durability, and
performance. The materials and details, including the front
balconies design, should be consistent with the proposed
architectural expression.
7. The proposed unit mix, including 23 one-bedroom units (48%),
15 two-bedroom units (31%), and 10 three-bedroom units (21%),
is to be included in the Development Permit drawings.
Note to Applicant: Any changes in the unit mix from the rezoning
application may only be varied under the discretion of the

Public Hearing
Minutes, Tuesday, December 12, 2017 22
Director of Planning or Development Permit Board provided that
it does not go lower than 50% of the dwelling units designed to
be suitable for families with children.
8. Submission of a bird-friendly strategy for the design of the
building is encouraged in the application for a development
permit.
Note to Applicant: Refer to the Bird-Friendly Design Guidelines
for examples of built features that may be applicable. For more
information, see the guidelines at
http://former.vancouver.ca/commsvcs/guidelines/B021.pdf.
Crime Prevention through Environmental Design (CPTED)
9. Design development to respond to CPTED principles, having
particular regard for the following:
(i) theft in the underground parking;
(ii) residential break and enter;
(iii) mail theft; and
(iv) mischief in alcoves and vandalism, such as graffiti.
Landscape Design
10. Design development to increase the amount of common outdoor
area and expand programming by providing a second common
amenity area at the south side of the building to provide an
opportunity for sunnier orientation.
Note to Applicant: This should include relocating the urban
agriculture plots to the south side for better solar exposure.
Shared gardening areas should reference and be designed to
adhere to Council’s Urban Agriculture Guidelines for the Private
Realm and should provide maximum solar exposure, universal
accessibility and provided with amenities such as raised beds,
water for irrigation, potting bench, tool storage, and
composting.
11. Design development to the front yard to provide a transition
zone to the street, extend patios further out away from the
building cover, and realign the terraced retaining wall to follow
the curvature of the street.
Note to Applicant: Terraced walls should recall the site history
and respect the existing stone wall currently in front of 87
Southwest Marine Drive. This can be accomplished through the
use of a true stone masonry wall or an architectural concrete
wall.

Public Hearing
Minutes, Tuesday, December 12, 2017 23
12. Design development to provide a second row of street trees on
the inside boulevard, consistent with the Marpole Community
Plan, away from the parkade structure on free grade.
Note to Applicant: The parkade structure may need to be
setback or angled away from the edge to allow proper rootball
development. Street trees should be aligned to follow the
curvature of the sidewalk and street on private property, except
for the trees at the southwest corner, where the property line
does not follow this alignment.
13. Design development to delete awkward angular space created by
the parkade ramp turn, near the property line, (currently shown
as gravel) and integrate into the building.
Note to Applicant: This space, as shown, poses a CPTED concern.
14. Design development to improve the expression of the main entry
by provision of flanking planting beds on either side, containing
some colourful, friendly, woody evergreen shrubs.
15. Design development to provide a substantial landscape buffer at
the lane interface, oriented to the lane.
16. Design development to improve sustainability and expand
programming to include edible plants integrated into the
landscape design, in addition to urban agriculture plots.
Note to Applicant: Edible plants can be used as ornamentals as
part of the landscape design. Shared gardening areas should
reference and be designed to adhere to Council’s Urban
Agriculture Guidelines for the Private Realm and should provide
maximum solar exposure, universal accessibility and provided
with amenities such as raised beds, water for irrigation, potting
bench, tool storage and composting.
17. Provision of maximized tree growing medium and planting depths
for tree and shrub planters to ensure long-term viability of the
landscape.
Note to Applicant: Underground parking slabs and retaining walls
may need to be altered to provide adequate depth and
continuous soil volumes. Growing mediums and planting depths
should exceed BCSLA standard.
18. A full Landscape Plan for the proposed landscape is to be
submitted. The Landscape Plan should illustrate proposed plant
materials (with common and botanical names, plant sizes and
quantities), paving, walls, railings, light fixtures, site grading
and other landscape features. Plant material should be listed in
a Plant List that is clearly keyed to the Landscape Plan. The
Landscape Plan should be a minimum of 1:100 or 1/8” scale.

Public Hearing
Minutes, Tuesday, December 12, 2017 24
19. Section details at a minimum of 1/4”=1’ scale to illustrate
typical proposed landscape elements including planters on
structures, benches, fences, gates, arbours and trellises, and
other features. Planter section details must be dimensioned and
confirm depth of proposed planting on structures is deep enough
to accommodate rootballs of proposed trees well into the future.
20. Sections (1/4”=1’ or 1:50) illustrating the building to public
realm interface facing the street, confirming a delineated
private to public transition of spaces.
Note to Applicant: The section should include the building
façade, as well as any steps, retaining walls, guardrails, fences
and planters. The location of the underground parking slab
should be included in the section.
21. Design development to locate, integrate and fully screen the
lane edge gas meters and parking garage vents in a manner
which minimizes their impact on the architectural expression
and the project’s open space and public realm.
22. New proposed street trees should be coordinated with the Park
Board and Engineering and noted “Final species, quantity and
spacing to the approval of City Engineer and Park Board”.
Contact Eileen Curran (604-871-6131) of Engineering Streets

CONDITIONS OF APPROVAL OF THE FORM OF DEVELOPMENT
(a) That the proposed form of development be approved by Council in
principle, generally as prepared by Hotson Architecture, on behalf of

Public Hearing
Minutes, Tuesday, December 12, 2017 34
South Street Development Group and stamped “Received Planning
Department, December 19, 2016”, provided that the Director of
Planning may allow minor alterations to this form of development when
approving the detailed scheme of development as outlined in (b) below.
(b) That, prior to approval by Council of the form of development, the
applicant shall obtain approval of a development application by the
Director of Planning, who shall have particular regard for the following:
Urban Design
1. Design development to improve the retail/commercial frontage
on Cambie Street and the plaza as follows:
(i) replace amenity space with a commercial retail unit
(CRU) fronting on the plaza.
(ii) provide servicing for CRU units on private property.
Note to Applicant: The northwest corner of Level 1, adjacent to
the residential entry, is recommended as an alternative location
for the indoor amenity room. The increased retail space may
trigger a requirement for a loading space (see Engineering
conditions). It is recommended that the bike storage be
relocated to P1. To provide a high-quality public realm in the
lane, as much landscaping as possible should be retained, and
the exterior wall facing the lane should be given careful design
consideration. CRU loading and servicing is typically separated
from residential circulation.
2. Design development to the building massing, to better
distinguish between Cambie Street (primary frontage) and 48th
Avenue (secondary frontage).
Note to Applicant: This can be achieved by:
(i) decreasing or deleting setbacks at Levels 9 and 10 for a
portion of the west and south elevations (i.e. up to 50%
of the elevation); and
(ii) increasing the setback at Level 4 on West 48th Avenue to
minimum 8 ft.
Note to Applicant: The intent is to create a more prominent
“corner building” expression facing the plaza and station site,
while reinforcing 48th Avenue as a secondary street frontage
with a more neighbourly character.

Public Hearing
Minutes, Tuesday, December 12, 2017 35
3. Design development to better animate the public pedestrian
connector.
Note to Applicant: This may be achieved by adding windows at
Level 1, creating a more varied, visually-interesting screen to
the parkade, adding climbing plants and/or a green wall, lighting
features, and/or a combination of the above.
4. Design development to create a plaza for public use, as
described in Section 6.5 of the Cambie Corridor Plan, “Public
Realm: Public Places”.
Note to Applicant: The final plaza design should adhere to the
requirements of the Cambie Corridor Public Realm Plan, upon its
completion and adoption, and will require coordination with the
General Manager of Engineering Services.
5. Design development to improve the livability of dwelling units,
as follows:
(i) Reconfigure Level 2 and 3 floorplans so that no unit fronts
solely onto the internal side yard (east PL).
(ii) Remove internal rooms (i.e. without an exterior window,
referred to as “dens” on the floorplans).
(iii) Provide closets in all bedrooms.
(iv) Align internal walls to meet mullions or sections of solid
exterior wall.
(v) Reconfigure unit layouts to avoid narrow, non-functional
spaces (i.e. between exterior balcony walls and bedroom
partition walls).
(vi) Ensure that storage meets the requirements of the Bulk
Storage bulletin:
http://bylaws.vancouver.ca/bulletin/b004.pdf.
(vii) Eliminate enclosed balconies in the east elevation.
Note to Applicant: The east elevation is the most protected from
traffic noise impacts, and so there is a lack of rationale for
enclosed balconies on this elevation.
6. Design development to improve the residential common
amenities, by introducing opportunities for children’s play
activities for a range of ages.
Note to Applicant: Play equipment is not required for the
children′s play areas but a soft surface play area and creative

Public Hearing
Minutes, Tuesday, December 12, 2017 36
landscape/play features (such as balancing logs and boulders,
sandbox, a small/tangible water stream or feature, creative
motor-skills developing features, etc.) which provide a myriad of
creative play opportunities for a range of ages is encouraged.
7. Design development of the building elevations, as follows:
(i) Provide a more prominent architectural expression for
the main residential entry.
Note to Applicant: This may be achieved by reconfiguring
the entry to face Cambie Street and/or providing an
entry canopy. Planting, lighting and exterior furniture
should also be considered.
(ii) Provide entry canopies for the ground-oriented units on
the north elevation.
(iii) Provide weather canopies for the retail frontage, at
locations where there is not a building overhang (i.e. east
side of plaza).
(iv) Provide further information on the building materials, as
follows:
a. Material/finish of patio walls on north elevation.
b. Material/finish of horizontal bands between each
storey.
c. Material of balcony guardrails.
d. Material/finish of soffits (particularly for
overhangs over public realm) and fascias.
e. Confirm if panels are spandrel glass or metal panel
(or combination).
f. Confirm thickness of brick veneer (min. 2.25”
thickness).
Note to Applicant: While it is understood that materials
and detailing may evolve during the development permit
stage, the rezoning submission should demonstrate a
commitment to provide durable, high quality materials
and robust detailing.

Public Hearing
Minutes, Tuesday, December 12, 2017 37
8. Identification on the architectural and landscape drawings of any
built features intended to create a bird friendly design.
Note to Applicant: Refer to the Bird Friendly Design Guidelines
for examples of built features that may be applicable, and
provide a design rationale for the features noted. For more
information, see the guidelines at
http://former.vancouver.ca/commsvcs/guidelines/B021.pdf.
Housing
9. The proposed unit mix, including 6 three-bedrooms (10%),
41 two-bedrooms (70%) and 12 one-bedrooms (20%) are to be
included in the Development Permit drawings.
Note to Applicant: Any changes in the unit mix from the rezoning
application may only be varied under the discretion of the
Director of Planning or Development Permit Board provided that
it does not go lower than 35% of the dwelling units designed to
be suitable for families with children.
10. Design development of common amenity space to include a
kitchenette, storage closet and accessible washroom with baby
change table, in the indoor amenity room.
Crime Prevention through Environmental Design (CPTED)
11. Design development to respond to CPTED principles, having
particular regard for:
(i) theft in the underground parking;
(ii) residential break and enter;
(iii) mail theft; and
(iv) mischief in alcoves and vandalism, such as graffiti.
Landscape Design
12. Design development to provide a more conservative tree removal
strategy, enabling the retention and protection of as many
healthy existing mature trees as possible, including retention or
relocation of Tree #1 and coordination with Park Board and
adjacent property owner for the removal of Tree #4.
Note to Applicant: It is expected that all developments will
adhere to Council’s approved Urban Forest Canopy Strategy, by
retaining a maximum of viable trees while still allowing
development. Tree #4 may need to be retained, if there is not
approval for removal. This may change the form of development.
Tree #1 is a Japanese Maple in good condition, usually a good
candidate for successful relocation, if retention in place is not
possible. This tree should be re- integrated into the landscape

Minutes, Tuesday, December 12, 2017 38
design. A revised Arborist Report should document and make
recommendations for methods of protection during construction.
13. Provision of a pedestrian friendly experience at the lane edges
by the use of down lighting and more substantial planting at
grade.
Note to Applicant: The lane edge planting should be protected
from vehicles by an 8” high curb.
14. Provision of maximized tree growing medium and planting depths
for tree and shrub planters to ensure long term viability of the
landscape.
Note to Applicant: Underground parking slabs and retaining walls
may need to be altered to provide adequate depth and
continuous soil volumes. Growing mediums and planting depths
should exceed BCSLA standard.
15. Provision of improved sustainability and expanded programming
by the provision of confirmed urban agriculture plots on the
rooftop and the addition of edible plants to the Plant Palette.
Note to Applicant: Edible plants can be used as ornamentals as
part of the landscape design. Shared gardening areas should
reference and be designed to adhere to Council’s Urban
Agriculture Guidelines for the Private Realm and should provide
maximum solar exposure, universal accessibility and provided
with amenities such as, raised beds, water for irrigation, potting
bench, tool storage and composting.
16. Provision of additional green roofs landscape plans for visible
planting from the street for terraces on Levels 3, 4, 5 and 9, as
well as providing trees and plants with an arching habit to soften
the edge of Level 4, overlooking the plaza.
Note to Applicant: This can be achieved by providing strategic
locations for planting beds, while still allowing for areas of
private balconies. Landscaped beds can act as privacy buffers
between units, with larger trees and shrubs in wider areas that
can accommodate them. Details should confirm adequate depth
of soil, to exceed BCSLA standard. Maintenance by tenants
should be confirmed as part of the rental agreements, with
written commitment for this as part of the development permit
application submission. Irrigation viability should be confirmed
by provision of either automatic high efficiency system
(preferred), or individual hose bibs for each unit.
17. Provision requirements at the time of Development Permit
application:

CONDITIONS OF APPROVAL OF THE FORM OF DEVELOPMENT
(a) That the proposed form of development be approved by Council in
principle, generally as prepared by Yamamoto Architecture Inc. and
stamped “Received City Planning Department, March 23, 2017”,
subject to the following conditions, provided that the General Manager
of Planning, Urban Design and Sustainability may allow minor
alterations to this form of development when approving the detailed
scheme of development as outlined in (b) below.
(b) That, prior to approval by Council of the form of development, the
applicant shall obtain approval of a development application by the
General Manager of Planning, Urban Design and Sustainability, who
shall have particular regard to the following:
Urban Design
1. Design development to increase the setbacks to improve
dwelling unit livability, particularly at the ground floor level
adjacent the Arbutus Greenway.
Note to Applicant: A patio setback of 7.5 ft. should be provided
at the west side of the ground floor including a 1.5 ft. landscape
strip as a buffer to the future pedestrian and bicycle path at the

Public Hearing
Minutes, Tuesday, December 12, 2017 50
adjacent Greenway. A front yard setback of 9.5 ft. should be
provided at the southeast corner to align with the front setback
at the adjacent building across the lane to the east.
2. Design development to the massing in response to the context
and site conditions.
Note to Applicant: The form may be less symmetrical to address
the different site conditions, in particular the prominence of the
southwest corner at the entrance to the Arbutus Greenway
which may have a more vertical expression.
3. Design development to increase the amount of common outdoor
amenity space.
Note to Applicant: While the constraints of the small site and the
proximity to the Greenway and neighbourhood parks are noted,
an outdoor amenity space of approximately 500 sq. ft. is to be
provided and include children’s play space.
4. That the proposed unit mix for family units, 35 per cent two-
bedroom units and 19 per cent three-bedroom units, be included
in the Development Permit drawings.
Note to Applicant: Any changes in the unit mix from the rezoning
application may only be varied under the discretion of the
Director of Planning or the Development Permit Board provided
that it does not go lower than 35 per cent of the dwelling units
designed to be suitable for families with children.
Crime Prevention through Environmental Design (CPTED)
5. Design development to respond to CPTED principles, having
particular regards for:
(i) theft in the underground parking;
(ii) residential break and enter;
(iii) mail theft; and
(iv) mischief in alcoves and vandalism, such as graffiti.
Sustainability
6. All new buildings in the development will meet the requirements
of the preceding Green Buildings Policy for Rezonings (as
amended up to January 14, 2016), including a minimum of 63
points (LEED® Gold rating), with 1 point for water efficiency and
1 point for stormwater or rainwater management, and a 22 per
cent reduction in energy cost as compared to ASHRAE 90.1 2010,
along with registration and application for certification of the
project.

Public Hearing
Minutes, Tuesday, December 12, 2017 51
Note to Applicant: A Sustainable Design Strategy must be
submitted as part of the Development Permit that articulates
which credits the applicant will be pursuing and how their
building application, as submitted, incorporates strategies,
features or technologies that will help achieve these credits. The
strategy, along with the LEED checklist, must be incorporated
into the drawing submission. A letter from a LEED Accredited
Professional or Administrator must confirm that the proposed
strategy aligns with the applicable goals of the rezoning policy.
Proof of registration of the CaGBC must be provided with the
application and the project registration number incorporated
into the drawings. Application for Certification will be required
at a subsequent stage.
Landscape Design
7. Final Design development to the integration of the ground level
planters, underground slab and overall architecture to provide
maximum plant growing depth (exceed BCLNA Landscape
Standard) to support tree and plant health.
Note to Applicant: This can be done by angling the parking
structure slab down at the edges. Raised planters at the front
edge should be minimized or avoided. Consideration to building
code parking space headroom clearance limits is needed.
Underground parkade uses that would prohibit slab angling
should be relocated away from planted edges, especially the
front (south) edge, to the greatest extent practicable.
8. Further coordination with City staff and the project arborist at
the development permit stage to protect street tree roots
associated with public realm improvements.
Note to Applicant: This will require further attention by the
landscape architect and project arborist to anticipate and
reduce unnecessary root disturbances, wherever possible.
Retention of the existing public sidewalk/boulevard in the
critical root zone may be necessary. The below grade foundation
design should employ vertical excavation and shotcrete shoring
techniques that remain in place permanently to the degree
necessary to enhance tree root protection. Coordination will be
needed with Engineering, Planning and Park Board (Urban
Forestry) for the final public ream landscape design submitted
for development permit and construction phase.

Public Hearing
Minutes, Tuesday, December 12, 2017 52
9. At time of Development Permit:
(i) Provision of a detailed Landscape Plan illustrating
common and botanical name, size and quantity of all
existing/ proposed plant material.
Note to Applicant: Plant material should be clearly
illustrated on the Landscape Plan and keyed to the Plant
List. The landscape plan should include all exterior hard
and soft surface elements (site furniture, gates, fences,
surfaces, screens, walls), the public realm treatment (to
the curb) and all existing or proposed street trees,
adjoining landscaping/ grades and public utilities such as
lamp posts, hydro poles, fire hydrants.
(ii) Provision of large scale architectural and landscape
sections [typical] through planted areas, including the
slab-patio-planter relationship.
Note to Applicant: The sections should include the
planter materials, tree stem, canopy and root ball.
(iii) Deletion of artificial turf in the west sideyard (planted
area).
Note to Applicant: Alternative planting materials should
be explored.
(iv) Large scale detailed elevations/sections for the proposed
green wall system and the perimeter fencing.
Note to Applicant: Perimeter fencing should be high
quality and consistent with architectural materials.
Fencing adjacent the Arbutus Greenway should be
residential in scale and allow light through to the
hedging.
(v) Provision of additional details for storm water
management on the landscape/building plans and in a
letter from the subject matter expert.
Note to Applicant: Response should include calculations
for achieving LEED performance credits and rainwater
targets.

Council Decision
MOVED by Councillor Louie
SECONDED by Councillor Jang
A. THAT the application by Arno Matis Architecture on behalf of Create Properties
Ltd, the registered owner, to rezone 4238-4262 Cambie Street [Lots 2-3,
Block 701, District Lot 526, Plan 6539; PIDs 010-872-701 and 010-872-710
respectively] from RS-1 (One-Family Dwelling) District to CD-1 (Comprehensive
Development) District, to increase the floor space ratio (FSR) from 0.70 to
2.75 and the height from 10.7 m (35 ft.) to 19.5 m (64 ft.) to permit the
development of a six-storey residential building, containing approximately
56 dwelling units including five townhomes, generally as presented in
Appendix A of the Policy Report dated October 31, 2017, entitled
“CD-1 Rezoning: 4238-4262 Cambie Street”, be approved subject to the
following conditions:
CONDITIONS OF APPROVAL OF THE FORM OF DEVELOPMENT
(a) That the prepared form of development be approved by Council in
principle, generally as prepared by Arno Matis Architecture, on behalf of
Create Properties Ltd., and stamped “Received Planning & Development
Services (Rezoning Centre), October 21, 2016”, provided that the
Director of Planning may allow minor alterations to this form of
development when approving the detailed scheme of development as
outlined in (b) below.
(b) That, prior to approval by Council of the form of development, the
applicant shall obtain approval of a development application by the
Director of Planning, who shall have particular regard for the following:
Urban Design
1. Design development of the townhouse massing to provide a
minimum building separation of 8 ft. to provide open space, a
substantial break in massing, and opportunities for an easier
connection to the lane.
Note to Applicant: A “substantial break” between buildings is
noted in the plan, Section 5.3.2. Open space may be used to

Public Hearing
Minutes, Tuesday, December 12, 2017 79
support outside amenity functions. See also Condition 2. Further,
confirmation of the location of a transformer should be
incorporated in the proposed site design. The laneway
townhouse building must not exceed 80 ft. in length.
2. Design development to relocate the amenity room to the main
building and to meet the courtyard’s design elevation. Provide a
larger outside amenity space co-located with the indoor amenity
space.
Note to Applicant: The proposed amenity room at approximately
7.5 ft. above natural grade is not supportable. Further, to
enhance its design for those with accessible needs, it should be
located at the courtyard level. Further design development
should be carried out to increase the amount of common open
space.
3. Design development to reduce the overall courtyard elevation to
better relate to natural grade, in particular, along the north
property line.
Note to Applicant: The currently proposed interface of the
courtyard at approximately 5 ft. above the existing grade of the
site to the north is not supported. Existing grades at the corners
of the site on the north property line, front and rear corners,
show the site to be substantially flat. This design refinement
may require the elevation of the townhouse massing to be
adjusted, and will also eliminate the need for ramping in the
along the north property line.
4. Design development to comply with the maximum height of the
CD-1 By-law of 19.5 m.
Note to Applicant: Maximum height is measured to the top of
parapet. This condition will require that all other building
elements must comply with the Zoning & Development By-law.
5. Design development to remove enclosed stair access (in two
cases) at the roof that provides access to private roof decks.
Provide roof hatches instead.
Note to Applicant: The stairs to private roof access add mass and
bulk of the building. Removal of same will enable other roof
access to be excluded from height pursuant to Section 10 of the
Zoning and Development By-law.

Public Hearing
Minutes, Tuesday, December 12, 2017 80
6. Maintain the proposed high quality materials (which may include
composite metal panel, masonry, high quality cementitious
panel systems, architecturally exposed concrete or similar) and
level of detailing implied and necessary to accomplish and
construct the proposed design aesthetic with exceptional
detailing as shown on the rezoning application plans.
Note to Applicant: Hardie plank and panels is not considered a
high quality material.
Housing
7. The proposed unit mix, including 6 three-bedrooms (11%),
30 two-bedrooms (53%), and 20 one-bedrooms (36%) is to be
included in the Development Permit drawings.
Note to Applicant: Any changes in the unit mix from the rezoning
application may only be varied under the discretion of the
Director of Planning or Development Permit Board provided that
it does not go lower than 35% of the dwelling units designed to
be suitable for families with children.
Crime Prevention through Environmental Design (CPTED)
8. Design development to respond to CPTED principles, having
particular regard for:
(i) theft in the underground parking;
(ii) residential break and enter;
(iii) mail theft; and
(iv) mischief in alcoves and vandalism, such as graffiti.
Landscape Design
9. Design development to improve the common open space
courtyard to enable the following:
(i) increase the amount of outdoor amenity space;
(ii) maintain visual connection from indoor amenity building
to outdoor space;
(iii) better connection and flow between play area and other
common uses; and
(iv) better solar access.
Note to Applicant: The courtyard space is presently substantially
privatized and not commonly accessed. Improved outside
commonly accessed amenity space is required (See also Urban
Design condition 2).

Public Hearing
Minutes, Tuesday, December 12, 2017 81
10. Provision of a detailed Landscape Plan illustrating soft and hard
landscape treatment. The Landscape Plan should include:
(i) Illustration of proposed plant materials (with common
and botanical names, plant sizes and quantities), paving,
walls, railings, light fixtures, site grading and other
landscape features. Plant material should be listed in a
Plant List that is clearly keyed to the Landscape Plan.
The Landscape Plan should be a minimum 1:100 or 1/8 in.
scale.
(ii) Section details at a minimum scale of 1/4 in. = 1 ft. scale
to illustrate typical proposed landscape elements
including planters on structures, benches, fences, gates,
arbors and trellises, and other features. Planter section
details must be dimensioned to confirm depth of
proposed planting on structures exceeds BCSLA standard
to accommodate root balls of proposed trees well into
the future.
(iii) Sections (1/4 in. = 1 ft. or 1:50) illustrating the buildings
to public realm interface facing the street, confirming a
delineated private to public transition of spaces.
Note to Applicant: The section should include the building
façade, as well as any steps, retaining walls, guardrails,
fences and planters. The location of the underground
parking slab should be included in the section.
11. Design development to locate, integrate and fully screen lane
edge gas meters and parking garage vents in a manner which
minimizes their impact on the architectural expression and the
project’s open space and public realm.
12. New proposed street trees should be coordinated with
Engineering and the Park Board and noted “Final species,
quantity and spacing to the approval of City Engineer and Park
Board.”
Note to Applicant: Contact Eileen Curran (604-871-6131) of
Engineering Streets Division regarding street tree spacing and
quantity. Contact Cabot Lyford (604- 257-8587) of Park Board
regarding tree species.

Minutes, Tuesday, December 12, 2017 82
14. A Landscape Lighting Plan to be provided for security purposes.
Note to Applicant: Lighting details can be added to the
landscape drawings; all existing light poles should be shown.
15. Design development to provide a more conservative tree removal
strategy, enabling the retention and protection of as many
healthy existing mature trees as possible, including retention or
relocation of Tree #97 and increased protection for the retained
City owned trees, to fully protect entire root zone.
Note to Applicant: It is expected that all developments will
adhere to Council’s approved Urban Forest Canopy Strategy, by
retaining a maximum of viable trees while still allowing
development. This may require revisions to the parkade. Tree
#97 is a Japanese Maple in good condition, usually a good
candidate for successful relocation, if retention in place is not
possible. This tree should be re-integrated into the landscape
design. A revised Arborist Report should document and make
recommendations for methods of protection during construction.
16. Provision of a pedestrian friendly experience at the lane edges
by the use of down lighting and more substantial planting at
grade.
Note to Applicant: The lane edge planting should be protected
from vehicles by an 8 in. high curb.
17. Provision of maximized tree growing medium and planting depths
for tree and shrub planters to ensure long term viability of the
landscape.
Note to Applicant: Underground parking slabs and retaining walls
may need to be altered to provide adequate depth and
continuous soil volumes. Growing mediums and planting depths
should be to BCSLA standards or better.
18. Provision of improved sustainability by the provision of
confirmed urban agriculture plots and the addition of edible
plants to the Plant Palette.
Note to Applicant: Edible plants can be used as ornamentals as
part of the landscape design. Shared gardening areas should
reference and be designed to adhere to Council’s Urban
Agriculture Guidelines for the Private Realm and should provide
maximum solar exposure, universal accessibility and provided
with amenities such as, raised beds, water for irrigation, potting
bench, tool storage and composting.
19. Consideration to incorporate the principles of the City of
Vancouver, Bird- Friendly Design Guidelines for the protection,

Public Hearing
Minutes, Tuesday, December 12, 2017 83
enhancement and creation of bird habitat and to reduce
potential threats to birds in the City. Submission of a bird
friendly strategy for the design of the building and landscape is
encouraged in the application for a development permit.
Note to Applicant: Strategy should identify any particular risks
with regard to the Bird Friendly Design Guidelines and propose
design features or to reduce these risks. For more information,
see the guidelines at
http://former.vancouver.ca/commsvcs/guidelines/B021.pdf.
Sustainability
20. Provision of a Recycling and Reuse Plan for Green
Demolition/Deconstruction, for the demolition of existing
buildings on site, to recycle/reuse at least 75% of demolition
waste (excluding hazardous materials).
Note to Applicant: The Recycling and Reuse Plan for Green
Demolition/Deconstruction should be provided at the time of
development permit application.
21. Any new building in the development will meet the requirements
of the preceding Green Buildings Policy for Rezonings (as
amended up to January 14, 2016), including a minimum of 63
points (LEED® Gold rating), with 1 point for water efficiency and
stormwater management and a 22% reduction in energy cost as
compared to ASHRAE 90.1 2010, along with registration and
application for certification of the project.
Note to Applicant: A Sustainable Design Strategy must be
submitted as part of the Development Permit that articulates
which credits the applicant will be pursuing and how their
building application, as submitted, incorporates strategies,
features or technologies that will help achieve these credits. The
strategy, along with the LEED checklist, must be incorporated
into the drawing submission. A letter from a LEED Accredited
Professional or Administrator must confirm that the proposed
strategy aligns with the applicable goals of the rezoning policy.
Proof of registration of the CaGBC must be provided with the
application and the project registration number incorporated
into the drawings. Application for Certification will be required
at a subsequent stage.
