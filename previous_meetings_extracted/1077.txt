3. Call for Bold Provincial Actions to Tackle Vancouver’s Housing Affordability Crisis
The motion below contains changes to the original motion on notice which were accepted by
Council.
MOVED by Councillor Carr
SECONDED by Councillor Reimer
WHEREAS
1. In November of 2017 Council approved the Housing Vancouver Strategy
(2018 - 2027) (the “Strategy”) to address Vancouver’s escalating housing
affordability crisis;
2. According to the Strategy, Vancouver residents feel that housing has become a
commodity for investment, resulting in a serious and growing equity gap
between generations, between owners and renters, and between our lowest
and highest income earners;
3. The Strategy also states that speculative demand has distorted land and
housing prices, posing a critical barrier to a healthy housing market and to
creating new housing that is affordable in the near and long term;
4. New data indicates almost 20 percent of new condos in Vancouver are owned
by non-residents (Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, December, 2017);
5. Speculation and flipping of properties generates enormous wealth for investors,
but does not provide revenues to the City of Vancouver;
6. Vancouver needs revenues from development to pay for new infrastructure
necessitated by that development, including roads, transportation, utilities,

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, Tuesday, February 20, 2018 13
and fire and police services, and public amenities such as community and
recreation centres, non-market housing, childcare, libraries and parks;
7. A top priority of our Housing Vancouver Strategy’s 3-Year Action Plan (2018 –
2020) is to work with senior governments to address speculation, potentially
through measures such as a speculation and flipping tax and restricting
property ownership by non-permanent residents;
8. With a ratio of median annual household income to detached housing prices of
1:37, when 1:5 is considered to be “severely unaffordable”, Vancouver is one
of the world’s most unaffordable cities. The severity of Vancouver’s housing
crisis demands bold action.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT the Mayor on behalf of Council, write to Premier John Horgan and
express gratitude for standing up for the Canadian Values of inclusivity,
diversity and openness and keeping British Columbia an open economy,
and to express Council’s support for bold actions that the province can
take to curb speculation and reduce the impact of global capital on
Vancouver’s real estate market, including but not limited to:
i. A restriction on purchasing of property by non-residents.
ii. The “speculators tax” introduced as part of budget 2018, in the
form of a property tax surcharge that targets absentee owners
who own property in Vancouver but do not pay appropriate
income taxes here on world-wide income.
iii. An additional “flipping tax” on capital gains when properties are
flipped within a short period of time for speculative gain. The
flipping tax should apply to presale condos prior to completion,
as well as a property transfer tax on each transaction with
mandatory full disclosure at the Land Title Office for all
presales.
B. THAT the Mayor on behalf of Council, request of the Premier that
revenues generated by these measures be used to alleviate the housing
crisis including but not limited to new non-market social and supportive
housing and to retrofit older affordable non-market housing, both to
maintain its availability at affordable rents and to meet climate change
objectives.
C. THAT Council direct staff to work with the provincial government to
support policies that directly tackle the negative effects of global
capital and speculation on Vancouver’s real estate market.

speculation and reduce the impact of speculation and fraud on Vancouver’s
real estate market, including but not limited to:
i. An end to restrictive zoning, the lack of incentives for rental and

ii. A “speculators tax” in the form of a property tax surcharge that
targets absentee non tax paying owners who do not live in or

2027) (the “Strategy”) to address Vancouver’s escalating housing affordability
crisis;
2. According to the Strategy, Vancouver residents feel that housing has become a
commodity for investment, resulting in a serious and growing equity gap
between generations, between owners and renters, and between our lowest
and highest income earners;
3. The Strategy also states that speculative demand has distorted land and
housing prices, posing a critical barrier to a healthy housing market and to
creating new housing that is affordable in the near and long term;
4. New data indicates almost 20 percent of new condos in Vancouver are owned
by non-residents (Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, December, 2017);
5. Speculation and flipping of properties generates enormous wealth for investors,
but does not provide revenues to the City of Vancouver;
6. Vancouver needs revenues from development to pay for new infrastructure
necessitated by that development, including roads, transportation, utilities,
and fire and police services, and public amenities such as community and
recreation centres, non-market housing, childcare, libraries and parks.
7. A top priority of our Housing Vancouver Strategy’s 3-Year Action Plan (2018 –
2020) is to work with senior governments to address speculation, potentially
through measures such as a speculation and flipping tax and restricting
property ownership by non-permanent residents;
8. With a ratio of median annual household income to detached housing prices of
1:37, when 1:5 is considered to be “severely unaffordable”, Vancouver is one
of the world’s most unaffordable cities. The severity of Vancouver’s housing
crisis demands bold action.

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, Tuesday, February 20, 2018 16
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT the Mayor on behalf of Council, write to Premier John Horgan and
express gratitude for standing up for the Canadian Values of inclusivity,
diversity and openness and keeping British Columbia an open economy,
and to express Council’s support for bold actions that the province can
take to curb speculation and reduce the impact of global capital on
Vancouver’s real estate market, including but not limited to:
i. A restriction on purchasing of property by non-residents
ii. The “speculators tax” introduced as part of budget 2018, in the
form of a property tax surcharge that targets absentee owners
who own property in Vancouver but do not pay appropriate
income taxes here on world-wide income.
iii. An additional “flipping tax” on capital gains when properties are
flipped within a short period of time for speculative gain. The
flipping tax should apply to presale condos prior to completion,
as well as a property transfer tax on each transaction with
mandatory full disclosure at the Land Title Office for all
presales.
B. THAT the Mayor on behalf of Council, request of the Premier that
revenues generated by these measures be used to alleviate the housing
crisis including but not limited to new non-market social and supportive
housing and to retrofit older affordable non-market housing, both to
maintain its availability at affordable rents and to meet climate change
objectives.
C. THAT Council direct staff to work with the provincial government to
support policies that directly tackle the negative effects of global capital
and speculation on Vancouver’s real estate market.
4. Lane Activation and Animation
MOVED by Councillor Louie
SECONDED by Councillor Deal
WHEREAS
1. The Sign By-law regulates signs located on private property, with the intent to
support local commercial activity through appropriate identification of
businesses and way finding, and to prevent sign proliferation and visual clutter
to ensure the effectiveness of signs;
2. The Sign By-law allows fascia signs in commercial districts to face lanes only if
they are located above a public entrance to a premises;

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, Tuesday, February 20, 2018 17
3. Council has adopted policy through local area plans and guidelines to
encourage lane activation and animation throughout the city by encouraging
residential and other active uses on lanes and supporting art programs on
lanes, to recognize that lanes serve as multi-purpose public spaces that
function as part of the overall pedestrian network and contribute to community
character and a diverse and robust public realm;
4. Business identification signs may also provide interest and animation to walls
on commercial lanes and direct customers to businesses.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to bring forward
recommendations to amend the Sign By-law to align with Council policy in order to
enhance lane activation in commercial areas throughout the city.

April 21, 2016 for an Affordable Home Ownership Pilot Program. This program
was unanimously supported by Council;
5. Since Council approval of the Affordable Home Ownership Pilot Program, staff
have informed Council that a change of the Vancouver Charter is necessary
before the City of Vancouver can move forward with Affordable Home
Ownership;
6. Councillor De Genova met with the former Minister of Housing, Rich Coleman at
the 2016 Union of British Columbia Municipalities Convention to discuss
Affordable Homeownership. The prepared briefing note that was submitted in

Housing Officer. The Minister acknowledged that BC Housing was studying
models and moving forward on a program for Affordable Home Ownership;

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, Tuesday, February 20, 2018 18
7. On June 14, 2016 Councillor De Genova brought forward a motion titled

Vancouver.” This motion was amended by the majority of Council and the
resolution changed to ask staff to report back to Council with a memo on steps
already taken by the City to increase opportunities for affordable townhouses
and row houses in recent years;
8. In recent years, there has been no specific zoning along with a program, such
as the Rental 100 Program, to specifically encourage the development of
townhouses and rowhomes in Vancouver;
9. Memos to Council are not going to fix the housing affordability crisis in
Vancouver;
10. The July 2017 Housing Engagement Summary reports:
• Page 5:“Affordability and the goal of owning a home are key reasons why
former Vancouver residents chose to leave the City.”
• Page 14: “70% of respondents rank affordability as most important guiding
value.”
• Page 17: The section titled “Affordability and Availability of Housing, Cost
of Living”, reports the first concern to be “lack of opportunities for
affordable homeownership affecting future decisions to make Vancouver
home.”
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT the Mayor write a letter on behalf of Council to the Minister of Municipal
Affairs and Housing requesting that the provincial government amend the
Vancouver Charter, to allow the City of Vancouver to move forward and
implement affordable homeownership.
B. THAT Council direct City of Vancouver staff to meet with BC Housing staff to
explore ways to move forward with Affordable Home Ownership in the absence
of amendments to the Vancouver Charter.
C. THAT Council direct staff to explore areas that can be zoned specifically to
include affordable home ownership and report back to Council within 60 days.

affordability of townhouses and row houses. Furthermore, that staff consider
zoning opportunities specific to this type of housing.

Council members voting in favour of the recommendations included Mayor
Robertson, Councillor Carr, Councillor Deal, Councillor Jang, Councillor Meggs,
Councillor Louie and Councillor Reimer;

Empty Homes tax, including those frequented for family purposes and report

3. The Empty Homes Tax has been applied to Vacant Land, where a home has
never existed. Vacant land does not encourage homes for renters;
4. Some of the people who have contacted Council with their concerns about the
Empty Homes Tax are individuals and professionals who stay in their homes one
to three weeks of the month for purposes of work and family. Although these
property owners frequent the property, they are still subjected to the 2018
Empty Homes Tax.

A. THAT Council direct staff to re-evaluate the Empty Homes Tax and provide
exemptions for individuals and/or families whom frequent their homes for
family or work purposes and report back to Council within 30 days.
B. THAT staff report back to Council with metrics as to how many homes
previously subjected to the Empty Homes Tax have been rented.
