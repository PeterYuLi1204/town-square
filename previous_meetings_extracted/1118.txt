2. Prioritizing New Pre-sale Homes for Vancouver Residents
The following motion contains a change to the original Motion on Notice which was accepted
by Council.
MOVED by Mayor Robertson
SECONDED by Councillor Louie
WHEREAS
1. The City’s new housing strategy aims to create 72,000 new homes over
10 years, to be affordable for people who live and work in Vancouver;
2. Vancouver’s Housing Reset focuses on the ‘right supply,’ by creating new
housing for people who live and work in Vancouver;
3. Vancouver has the strongest economy of any city in Canada, yet the rental
vacancy rate is below 1% and housing prices are out reach of the majority of
residents;
4. The City, through the Vancouver Affordable Housing Agency (VAHA), already
targets new affordable housing developments on city-owned land for people
who live and work in Vancouver;
5. Vancouver saw record levels of development last year, with close to 10,000
housing starts in 2016;
6. The 2015 census found that the City of Vancouver had the highest growth of
any city in Metro Vancouver of people aged 25 to 39, a growth rate that was
one of the highest nationally and with a rate 10% higher than the national
average;
7. In 2016, the District of West Vancouver negotiated a policy for a new
residential development, which prioritized marketing and sales to residents of
the municipality and region, as well as discouraged bulk purchases and the
flipping of units.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT City staff, as part of the ongoing Housing Reset,
bring forward a policy framework for new development applications that:
• gives residents who live and work in Metro Vancouver the first opportunity to
purchase new pre-sale homes in Vancouver;
• prevents the bulk purchases of units, and;
• limits the quick resale, or ‘flipping,’ of purchased units including
re-assignments.

homes over 10 years, to be affordable for people who live and
work in Vancouver;
2. Vancouver has the potential to have the strongest economy of
any city in Canada, yet the rental vacancy rate is below 1% and
housing prices are out reach of the majority of residents;
3. In June 2015, Council unanimously supported a motion by
Councillor De Genova for Affordable Home Ownership and
Alternative Housing Options;
4. Consistently the City of Vancouver has increased Development
Fees and in 2016 the majority of Council supported a 30%
increase to the cost of Development Fees for Rezoning
Applications;
5. Increased costs do contribute to the pricing of homes in the city
and Vancouver’s affordability crisis.
6. The 2015 census found that the City of Vancouver had the
highest growth of any city in Metro Vancouver of people aged
25 to 39, a growth rate that was one of the highest nationally
and with a rate 10% higher than the national average;
7. Many people have been forced out of Metro Vancouver and
specifically the City of Vancouver and have moved out of British
Columbia or Canada due to a lack of affordable housing;

THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to report back within 60 days with any
