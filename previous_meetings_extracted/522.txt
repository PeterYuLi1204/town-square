Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, March 30, 2022 8
MOVED by Councillor Boyle
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. Vancouverites continue to express concern about the loss of places of intangible
cultural heritage, including beloved small businesses, restaurants and other
cultural food assets. The threat of loss of these spaces is particularly acute for
migrant and newcomer communities, and other equity-denied groups, because of
the role that small local businesses play as an economic driver and the role that
food plays in connections to culture, community and identity;
2. Intangible cultural heritage refers to the forms of culture that are important to
groups of people, and are embedded in everyday life (for example
Filipino/Pilipino food culture). Cultural food assets are a significant example of
intangible cultural heritage, where intangible cultural heritage can be accessed,
experienced and transmitted. Cultural food assets include many small
businesses such as green grocers, restaurants, food courts, and venues or
services which are significant to a community or neighbourhood. These spaces
look and function in unique ways within different communities and may require
different approaches to protection and promotion;
3. Long-standing Vancouver housing policy has limited new rental and multi-family
housing to arterials, putting added speculative and development pressure on
commercial stretches including many culturally significant small and local
businesses and cultural food assets, representing a significant risk to the
intangible cultural heritage of many of Vancouver’s neighborhoods. Planner and
past Vancouver Councillor Gordon Price refers to this intentional political and
policy choice as the “Grand Bargain”.1 Additionally, new ground floor commercial
spaces tend to have larger floor plates that are less economically viable for many
small, locally-owned businesses;
4. In recent decades the majority of new rental and multi-family housing has been
built in low- and middle-income neighbourhoods, and neighbourhoods with a
higher percentage of racialized and immigrant residents. These neighbourhoods
are home to many small businesses significant to equity-denied communities,
resulting in greater risk of displacement due to redevelopment;
5. COVID-19 continues to create significant financial pressure on small businesses,
and existing inequalities have been exacerbated by the pandemic, creating
additional pressure on small businesses, culturally focused non-profits, or food
assets critical to a neighbourhood or a community’s culture. Vancouver City
Council and small business leaders have been calling for Split Assessment
taxation as one tool to relieve pressure on small local businesses;
6. The COVID-19 pandemic has also uncovered systemic food insecurity within
racialized and equity-seeking communities most impacted by unemployment,
precarious or unsafe work. And has resulted in delays in a number of city

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, March 30, 2022 9
programs, including continued work on increasing the financial accessibility and
availability of food access and an update to the Vancouver Food Strategy Report.
In many neighbourhoods local food networks or non-profit organizations have
stepped in to fill these gaps;
7. Grassroots community mobilization in a variety of Vancouver neighbourhoods
have spearheaded the protection and revitalization of cultural food assets, and
have been calling on the City of Vancouver to act to protect culturally significant
food assets across the city:
a. Organizations such as hua foundation, Chinatown Concern Group, the
City of Vancouver’s Chinatown Legacy Stewardship Group, Youth
Collaborative for Chinatown, and Yarrow Intergenerational Society for
Justice have been supporting heritage business retention,
intergenerational community building and affordability advocacy in
Chinatown.
b. The Punjabi Market Collective is a group of passionate advocates, artists,
students and entrepreneurs who are working towards revitalizing
Vancouver’s historic Punjabi Market by beautifying the market,
developing and promoting businesses and creating a hub for arts and
culture.
c. The Joyce St Action Network is a group of Filipino/Pilipino and Chinese
community organizers who have been working to support the retention of
six Chinese, Korean and Filipino/Pilipino cultural food assets currently at
risk of displacement near Joyce Station.
d. The Hogans Alley Society and Black and African diaspora residents have
been working for cultural redress for the black community in North East
False Creek, recognizing the historic displacement of the black
community, including black agriculture and businesses. The Nora Hendrix
TMH includes a culturally rooted food and herb garden for residents and
the community.
8. The work of Vancouver’s Taskforce on Implementing the UN Declaration on the
Rights of Indigenous People (UNDRIP), composed of elected officials from
Musqueam, Squamish and Tsleil Waututh Nations and the City of Vancouver,
and engagement with Urban Indigenous communities is framed around four
themes including “Social, Cultural and Economic Well-Being”. The relationships
between land, culture and heritage are an important part of this discussion,
related to multiple articles of UNDRIP;
9. In March 2020, Vancouver City Council approved the Heritage Action Plan -
Vancouver Heritage Program, which included a commitment to better integrate
Truth & Reconciliation, Cultural Redress, and Tangible and Intangible Cultural
Heritage;
10. In 2019, Council approved Culture|Shift: Blanketing the City in Arts and Culture,
which included directions to prioritize intangible cultural heritage and promote

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, March 30, 2022 10
cultural redress and to prevent displacement and support affordable, accessible,
secure arts and culture spaces. Cultural Services is working with the Heritage
Group on incorporating intangible heritage into Vancouver Heritage Register;
11. The City of Vancouver has a number of other important initiatives completed or
underway that intersect with cultural food assets and intangible cultural heritage,
including: The Chinatown Legacy Business Study; Spaces to Thrive:
Vancouver’s Social Infrastructure Strategy; a Chinatown Cultural Heritage Asset
Management Plan led by the Chinatown Transformation Team; the Downtown
Eastside Special Enterprise Pilot Program, a Commercial Tenant Assistance
Program through the Employment Lands and Economy Review; cultural redress
within the North False Creek Plan, including supporting work of both the Black
community and Chinatown community-led efforts around land trusts;
12. Municipal level policies and protections in other cities provide examples that
Vancouver should explore for protecting cultural food assets and other forms of
intangible cultural heritage:
a. Integrating tangible and intangible cultural heritage into Heritage
Protection processes. This should begin with community-led identification
of places or assets of community value, and tools for both protecting
and/or promoting those places. Community groups should be
appropriately resourced to do this work. Intangible heritage tools include
the co-development of intangible cultural heritage criteria, an intangible
cultural heritage registry, promotion of identified places, funding and
business supports, and more. Similar approaches exist in London’s
recent Grassroots Music Venues Rescue Plan, and the advocacy and
forward thinking which resulted in the protection of Toronto’s historic
Silver Dollar Room.
b. Developing protections for cultural food assets, assets of community
value and other forms of intangible cultural heritage within the
redevelopment process. This could include requiring new developments
to demonstrate adequate community consultation and show a plan for
preserving existing cultural food assets and other forms of intangible
cultural heritage. Examples include San Francisco’s Formula Business
(chain store) restrictions which require Conditional Use authorization for
all formula (chain) retail establishments within all Neighbourhood
Commercial Districts2, or the Agent of Change Principle as seen within
the Australian, Music Victoria 2014 Position Paper.3
c. The development of Municipal Cultural Districts or Zones (that could
include a Land Trust model). This would require working with community
partners to identify eligibility criteria for determining what qualifies as a
2 Policy basis for formula businesses (chain stores) in San Francisco. https://sfplanning.org/project/policy-

Minutes, Wednesday, March 30, 2022 11
cultural district, as well as the particular needs for each district and the
appropriate mechanisms necessary for the protection and promotion of
intangible cultural heritage assets. Or could take a City-wide approach
that could be adapted for different contexts and communities. Examples
of this approach include the Bloor St. Culture Corridor in Toronto,
Mississauga’s Cultural Districts Implementation Plan, and San
Francisco’s Cultural Districts, as well as conversations already underway
in Vancouver’s Chinatown.
13. Intangible cultural heritage is traditional, contemporary and constantly adapting.
Due to challenges in defining which food assets are considered culturally
significant, the process and the mechanisms by which these assets are defined
and supported should be community-led and resourced appropriately;
14. The vibrancy of Vancouver neighbourhoods is created by the diverse
communities who live and work here, and the small local businesses and
intangible cultural heritage that have shaped and enriched them over time. As the
city continues to change and grow, policies need to be in place to protect these
spaces, and ensure that Vancouver remains culturally diverse and welcoming to
the many communities that call it home.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT
A. Council direct staff to explore and report back with recommendations on policy
changes within City of Vancouver jurisdiction for protecting and promoting
cultural food assets and other forms of intangible cultural heritage across
Vancouver. That this be cross-departmental work between Planning, Urban
Design and Sustainability (PDS) and Arts, Culture, and Community Services
(ACCS), building on existing city efforts, with the city’s Equity Framework as a
lens for where this work should be prioritized. And that it consider policy
approaches such as:
i. Updating Vancouver’s heritage protection processes to better account for
protecting cultural food assets and other forms of intangible cultural
heritage.
ii. Developing protections for cultural food assets and other forms of
intangible cultural heritage within the redevelopment process.
iii. Developing mechanisms for identifying and protecting significant cultural
assets through cultural zones or districts, cultural land trusts, or a special
cultural program that is accessible city-wide.
B. Council directs staff to apply the city’s Equity Framework to other food policy
related work, including the promotion of cultural assets within the city’s urban
agriculture, small business incubation, and farmers market and community food
markets strategies.
C. Council directs staff to work alongside relevant community organizations,
specifically working with underserved and equity-denied groups, to do research

11. Using the Capital Plan to Help Reach Our Housing Affordability Targets (Member’s
Motion B4)
At the Council meeting on March 29, 2022, Council referred the following motion to the Standing
Committee on City Finance and Services meeting on March 30, 2022, in order to hear from
speakers, followed by debate and decision.
The Committee heard from two speakers in support of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Swanson
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. Not enough housing that low income people can afford is being built in
Vancouver, including rental and social housing, as well as housing that is
suitable for families with children;
2. In its Healthy City Strategy (2014-2025), the city has committed to ensuring
affordable and supportive housing is available across all neighbourhoods;
3. According to, the City of Vancouver’s Rezoning Centre and Development
Permitting System and to Income distribution information sourced from the
Statistics Canada, Census 2016 between 2016 and 2021 the 39% of Vancouver
households with incomes under $50K could afford only 10% of the new housing
approved in the city;
4. According to the same data, between 2016 and 2021 68% of net new approved
units are affordable to the 40% of households who earn over $80K and have less
need than lower income households;
5. We desperately need non market, co-op and affordable housing for people
earning under $50K, $30K and $15K;
6. 17.5% of renters with an income of $0-$30,000 and 10.8% of renters with an
income of $30,0000-$50,000 are paying more than 30% of their income on rent
(Source: https://council.vancouver.ca/20171128/documents/rr1appendixa.pdf
page 10);
7. Traditionally the city supplies land for non market housing while senior
governments supply capital and operating costs if needed;

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, March 30, 2022 13
8. There is not enough city and/or non profit owned land in the city for the non
market housing that we need;
9. This means that non profit providers have to demolish existing affordable housing
in order to build more units at higher density on the same site;
10. As a result we lose existing affordable housing that could last and get fewer net
affordable units;
11. Senior government help is necessary to make housing affordable even when
land is provided but getting land is the first step; and
12. Building housing that low income workers can afford can help them live close to
their jobs and reduce green house gas emissions from commuting.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Vancouver City Council ask staff to report back
in time for Capital Budget deliberations on what amount of money is needed in the
capital budget to acquire enough land to meet our housing affordability targets, taking
into consideration existing City land that is or could be used for social housing;
FURTHER THAT all or part of this report back be in camera if needed, as it relates to
real estate transactions.

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, March 30, 2022 14
MOVED by Councillor De Genova
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. Violent crime has increased in the City of Vancouver at an alarming rate in recent
years despite many people working from home, and many businesses,
restaurants, bars, retail outlets and publics spaces being closed to the public
during COVID19. This is in addition to a severe decline in tourist activity as per
health guidelines and requirements;
2. The Vancouver Police Department (VPD) has released statistics citing that each
day, on average, there are more than four reported unprovoked and random
stranger attacks on victims in the City of Vancouver. Example, the violent
stabbing of a twenty-five-year-old man in January 2022 at a Downtown coffee
shop left him in hospital with life-threatening injuries;
3. The media have reported incidents of brutal and violent assaults to people who
live, work in or are visiting Vancouver;
4. A motion brought forward in October 2020 to have a Special Council meeting
was amended. The resolution no longer included a special meeting of the
Council where the public could speak to City Council about the current state of
public safety and violent crime in the City of Vancouver;
5. A motion titled ‘Public Safety: Evaluating and Addressing Any Impacts of City of
Vancouver Actions on Neighbourhood Safety’ passed in October 2021, and
although work on this motion is underway, a roundtable discussion with
businesses hosted by the City of Vancouver took place in December 2021. This
roundtable discussion included the VPD and a memo to Council including a list of
recommendations, concerns and suggestions from businesses that have been
affected by violent shoplifting and property crime;
6. The actions of City Councils and municipal governments in cities including
Seattle, San Francisco and Los Angeles have perpetuated violent crime street
disorder. Ultimately, this has resulted in negative ramifications on the safety and
wellbeing of these cities, including impact on their economy and tourism;
7. Presentations at many Vancouver City Council meetings have included people
who have shared their stories and concerns about public safety;
8. Businesses are dealing with the burdens of violent shoplifting, broken doors and
windows, and associated trauma on their employees. This has also resulted in a
decline in business;
9. Bringing back a defeated motion to Council is permissible after 365 days and is
addressed in section 8.14 of the procedure bylaw and states:
(c) if the motion is made more than 365 days after the motion was
defeated, or in a new Council term, the motion may be made by any

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services

Council member, regardless of how they voted or whether they voted in

10. Everyone deserves to feel safe in the City of Vancouver.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED

FINAL MOTION AS APPROVED
WHEREAS
1. Violent crime has increased in the City of Vancouver at an alarming rate in recent
years despite many people working from home, and many businesses,
restaurants, bars, retail outlets and publics spaces being closed to the public
during COVID19. This is in addition to a severe decline in tourist activity as per
health guidelines and requirements;
2. The Vancouver Police Department (VPD) has released statistics citing that each
day, on average, there are more than four reported unprovoked and random
stranger attacks on victims in the City of Vancouver. Example, the violent
stabbing of a twenty-five-year-old man in January 2022 at a Downtown coffee
shop left him in hospital with life-threatening injuries;
3. The media have reported incidents of brutal and violent assaults to people who
live, work in or are visiting Vancouver;
4. A motion brought forward in October 2020 to have a Special Council meeting
was amended. The resolution no longer included a special meeting of the
Council where the public could speak to City Council about the current state of
public safety and violent crime in the City of Vancouver;
5. A motion titled ‘Public Safety: Evaluating and Addressing Any Impacts of City of
Vancouver Actions on Neighbourhood Safety’ passed in October 2021, and
although work on this motion is underway, a roundtable discussion with
businesses hosted by the City of Vancouver took place in December 2021. This
roundtable discussion included the VPD and a memo to Council including a list of
recommendations, concerns and suggestions from businesses that have been
affected by violent shoplifting and property crime;
6. The actions of City Councils and municipal governments in cities including
Seattle, San Francisco and Los Angeles have perpetuated violent crime street
disorder. Ultimately, this has resulted in negative ramifications on the safety and
wellbeing of these cities, including impact on their economy and tourism;
7. Presentations at many Vancouver City Council meetings have included people
who have shared their stories and concerns about public safety;
8. Businesses are dealing with the burdens of violent shoplifting, broken doors and
windows, and associated trauma on their employees. This has also resulted in a
decline in business;

Minutes, Wednesday, March 30, 2022 18

13. Strengthening the Conditions of Landlord Licensing in Vancouver (Previously
Member Motion B7)
At the Council meeting on March 29, 2022, Council referred the following motion to the Standing
Committee on City Finance and Services meeting on March 30, 2022, in order to hear from
speakers, followed by debate and decision.
MOVED by Councillor Fry
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. Nearly 53% of private households by tenure in Vancouver are rented;
2. All businesses in Vancouver require a license to operate. This ensure business
locations are safe, meet land-use requirements, protect vulnerable populations,
and mitigate any potential noise or nuisance. While it is a common practice to
display a licence at place of business, the bylaw does not require it;
3. Regulations and conditions to operate a business in the City of Vancouver exist
under the Licence Bylaw (No. 4450) 1 and stipulate a number of specific business
and operational considerations:
a. Section 6(5) of the Licence By-law requires every City-issued licence to
be posted in a conspicuous place on the premises; and
b. Section 19.1 of the bylaw defines “Landlords” and the requirement that
they (or their agents) must comply with the Residential Tenancy Act of
British Columbia. To rent a residential property for 30 days or more in the
City of Vancouver, operators require a Long-term Rental Property
Business License; 2
4. Offences and Penalties for violating the provisions of the License Bylaw (No.
4450) range from $250 - $10,000 per day per offence. Additionally under the
Vancouver Charter, the Chief License Inspector is empowered to suspend a
licence at any time if the holder of the license is convicted of any offence under

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, March 30, 2022 21
any bylaw of the city with respect to the business;
5. The City of Vancouver’s Open Data portal “Rental standards - current issues”
dataset lists licensed rental properties with five or more units that have current
(unresolved) by-law issues. Updated daily, there are over 400 buildings with
maintenance, health, or safety issues – several going back many months;
6. Most tenancies in Vancouver are covered under the B.C. Residential Tenancy
Act (RTA). The dispute resolution process to protect the interests of tenants and
landlords alike involves arbitration, enforcement, and compliance by way of the
Residential Tenancy Branch (RTB). This process can be onerous: the arbitration
process can take weeks or months, and tenants are not always aware of their
rights. In response, tenant advocacy groups including TRAC, Vancouver
Tenant’s Union, and the City’s own Renters Office provide support and
information for renters;
7. The vast majority of landlords in Vancouver are ethical, responsible, and
adherent to the Residential Tenancy Act. Notwithstanding that, recent examples
of business practices that might be considered inconsistent with the stated
conditions of the RTA, including:
a. Failing to post emergency repair contact information onsite per Sec 33(2)
RTA;
b. Failing to include landlord’s legal name and an address for service as part
of tenancy agreement, as required by law to serve certain legal
documents per Sec 13(2) RTA;
c. Misrepresenting conditions of suites and tenancy agreements; 3
d. Fixed “long term” term tenancies in contravention of vacation rental rules;
3,4
e. Renovictions and evictions under false pretenses; 5
f. Failure to maintain appliances or utilities; 6,7 and/or
g. Failure to hold a valid City of Vancouver license;
8. In February 2022, Council approved the motion “Improving the Effectiveness of
the Standards of Maintenance By-law” with an amendment that staff report back
on the possibilities of requiring SRO owners to place permanent plaques in their
lobbies that would state the mailing address for service of documents to
landlords, how to call 311 with repair and maintenance issues, contact info and
function of the Residential Tenancy Branch;
9. Notwithstanding the role of the RTA and RTB for protecting tenants in BC, the
City of Vancouver has a role to protect and support its residents;

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, March 30, 2022 22
10. While respecting the supremacy of provincial tenancy acts, other local
governments in Canada including New Westminster, London Ontario, and
Montreal, Quebec are applying conditions to residential rental business licenses
to supplement and support their respective tenancy acts. New Westminster for
instance has added conditions to their licence to manage renoviction and punish
landlords that contravene the bylaw; 8 and
11. Despite the RTA, and despite assorted City of Vancouver polices and regulations
(including but not limited to Tenant Relocation and Protection Policy, Vancouver
Building By-law 12511, Single Room Accommodation By-law 8733, and License
By-law 4450) there remain opportunities and imperatives to better educate
renters about their rights under municipal and provincial policy.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council affirm the role of the City in licensing landlords is to ensure
residential rentals are safe, meet land-use requirements, protect vulnerable
populations, and mitigate any potential noise or nuisance.
B. THAT Council direct Legal Services to prepare appropriate amendments to the
License By-law (No. 4450) and Long-term Rental Property Business License
effective for 2023 licensing year, to direct landlords to display their City of
Vancouver Rental Property business licence in a location accessible and visible
to tenants and that the document explicitly includes:
a. Accurate and up-to-date name, contact information and address of the
landlord (or agent);
b. Notification that the adherence to the Residential Tenancy Act is a
condition of license; and
c. Identifies links to dispute resolution mechanisms and legal rights including
but not limited to the Residential Tenancy Act, Residential Tenancy
Branch, and Vancouver’s Renters Office.
