COUNCIL MEMBERS’ MOTIONS
1. Giving Effect to Cooling Rights in a Climate Emergency Through the Standards of
Maintenance By-law
The Committee heard from three speakers who spoke in support of the motion.

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, November 5, 2025 14
MOVED by Councillor Orr
SECONDED by Councillor Maloney
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. As a result of climate change, extreme heat events are becoming more
commonplace in Vancouver. The BC heat dome between June 25 to July 1,
2021, saw unprecedented high temperatures across the province. By 2050,
global climate models project that extreme heat events will be 4 times more
frequent1;
2. High indoor temperatures and lack of cooling systems in dwellings are a life-
threatening hazard. Vancouver Coastal Health notes that high indoor
temperatures are the most dangerous aspect of extreme heat events and are life-
threatening.2 A BC Coroner Service report noted that 619 heat-related deaths
occurred during the 2021 heat dome, 98% of which occurred indoors and most of
which occurred in homes without adequate cooling systems3;
3. High indoor temperatures and lack of cooling systems in dwellings are also a
human rights and climate justice issue.4 Heat-related deaths during the 2021
extreme heat event were higher among persons with chronic health conditions or
living in socially or materially deprived neighborhoods.5 Older adults, people who
are pregnant, infants and young children, and people with mental illness, other
pre-existing health conditions, limited mobility, or who are marginally housed, are
at higher risk of experiencing heat-related illness6;
4. Requirements for cooling have been implemented in the BC Building Code 2024
for all new builds.7 No equivalent provision is currently in place for existing
housing stock in Vancouver;
5. Vancouver maintains a Standards of Maintenance By-law to ensure properties
are maintained in conformity with accepted health, fire, and building
requirements. Pursuant the Residential Tenancy Act, landlords have an
obligation to maintain rental units in compliance with these standards.8 The By-
law contains a requirement that residential accommodations are to have heating
systems capable of maintaining a minimum indoor temperature.9 There is no
equivalent provision for cooling systems and maximum temperatures;

Minutes, Wednesday, November 5, 2025 15
6. On November 27, 2024, Council unanimously passed a motion imploring the
provincial government to amend the Vancouver Charter to specifically enumerate
a power to regulate maximum indoor temperatures. In doing so, Council
specifically recognized that extreme heat events and climate change pose
significant health risks for residents and that a “right to cool” has emerged as
essential to housing policy;
7. Municipalities such as Port Moody and New Westminster have given effect to the
right to cool by prohibiting landlords from unreasonably impeding a tenant from
using cooling systems to cool indoor temperatures.10 No equivalent prohibition is
currently in place for Vancouver landlords;
8. A similar prohibition is feasible in Vancouver. Section 330 of the Vancouver
Charter authorizes Council to make bylaws to provide for the care, promotion,
and protection of the health of the inhabitants of the city11; and
9. On May 29, 2025, the province amended the Vancouver Charter to confirm that
Vancouver has the jurisdiction to regulate in areas concurrently covered by
provincial regulatory regimes, such as residential tenancy matters12.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to report back with options
and recommendations regarding a by-law that prevents landlords from prohibiting or
preventing tenants from using portable cooling devices when no air conditioning is
otherwise provided;
FURTHER THAT this report back from staff should include consideration of:
a) How to regulate strata units;
b) Enforced tools including municipal ticket information and by-law notices; and
c) A possible appeal process similar to the one in section 24.1 of the Standards of
Maintenance By-law.

Minutes, Wednesday, November 5, 2025 16
MOVED by Councillor Bligh
SECONDED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. The City of Vancouver has made significant commitments to advancing gender
equity and inclusion through the Women’s Equity Strategy 2018-2028,1 adopted
by Council to guide policy, service delivery, and workplace culture, and to
address the issues faced by women in 5 priority areas, being:
a. Applying an intersectional lens to strengthen City processes and decision
making,
b. Addressing safety concerns and violence against women,
c. Accessible, quality childcare,
d. Safe and affordable housing, and
e. Women’s representation and leadership in our workforce;
2. Many other City of Vancouver initiatives are closely tied to and related to the
Women’s Equity Strategy 2018-2028, such as the UN Safe Cities and Safe
Public Spaces Initiative,2 as well as the Host City Human Rights Action Plan as a
part of FIFA World Cup 26™;
3. The recent closure of the Equity Office has created uncertainty regarding the
continuation, implementation, and accountability of this work;
4. National and provincial research continues to demonstrate that women—
particularly Indigenous, racialized, 2SLGBTQIA+, and low-income women—
experience disproportionate levels of violence, housing insecurity, and economic
marginalization;
5. The Women’s Equity Strategy 2018-2028 update to Council is overdue, with the
last update being issued to Mayor and Council in March 2022,3 and it is critical
that this work not be lost, delayed, or deprioritized in light of recent organizational
changes;
6. The City’s Women’s Advisory Committee plays an important role in advising
Council on issues affecting women and gender-diverse people, and in ensuring
that equity-related initiatives are informed by lived experience and community
expertise; and
7. While the City’s Women’s Advisory Committee did receive a brief update on the
Women’s Equity Strategy in June 2025,4 this update was lacking in robust
analysis of any progress made across all five pillars of the Women’s Equity
Strategy or details of Phase 2 implementation or completion, despite indication of
such an update scheduled for March 2023 in the March 2022 Memorandum,
Update on Women's Equity Strategy.5

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, November 5, 2025 17
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to report back to Council by Q1 2026 with an update on
the Women’s Equity Strategy, including:
1. Progress to date on the implementation of the strategy and key
performance indicators across each of the strategy’s five pillars;
2. Identification of any gaps, paused initiatives, or risks resulting from the
closure of the Equity Office; and
3. Options for maintaining accountability, reporting, and coordination of
equity-related work across City departments.
B. THAT Council direct staff to engage the Women’s Advisory Committee in the
preparation of said report, ensuring the Committee’s input informs the analysis,
recommendations, and proposed next steps.
C. THAT Council invite the Women’s Advisory Committee to participate in the
presentation of the report to Council, to reinforce transparency, accountability,
and collaboration in advancing gender equity.
Rationale: This motion seeks to ensure the continuity and accountability of the City’s Women’s
Equity Strategy 2018-2028 following the closure of the Equity Office and to advance a
coordinated approach to addressing gender-based violence. The motion directs staff to report
back on the status of the Women’s Equity Strategy and engage the Women’s Advisory
Committee.

SECONDED by Councillor Montague
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. The City of Vancouver has made significant commitments to advancing gender
equity and inclusion through the Women’s Equity Strategy 2018-2028,1 adopted
by Council to guide policy, service delivery, and workplace culture;
2. Thirty-four women have been killed in British Columbia since August 2024 as a
result of intimate partner violence, representing a public safety crisis that
disproportionately impacts women and gender-diverse people;2
3. National and provincial research continues to demonstrate that women—
particularly Indigenous, racialized, 2SLGBTQIA+, and low-income women—
experience disproportionate levels of violence, housing insecurity, and economic
marginalization;
4. At least 95 municipalities in Canada have declared violence against women and
intimate partner violence an epidemic;
5. The City’s Women’s Advisory Committee plays an important role in advising
Council on issues affecting women and gender-diverse people, and in ensuring
that equity-related initiatives are informed by lived experience and community
expertise;
6. The City’s Women’s Advisory Committee, on September 23rd, 2025,
unanimously recommended that the City of Vancouver “Create a…gender-based
violence task force that is community and survivor-centred to coordinate safety
across policing, housing, and justice to address this pressing issue,”3;
7. The annual 16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence campaign,
observed from November 25 (International Day for the Elimination of Violence
Against Women) to December 10 (Human Rights Day), provides an opportunity
for all orders of government to raise awareness, demonstrate leadership, and
take action to end gender-based violence;

Minutes, Wednesday, November 5, 2025 19
8. The use of proclamations and other recognition, such as the City of Vancouver’s
proclamation for Intimate Partner Violence Awareness Month on October 21st,
can serve as a signal of support, but in no way substitute concrete action;
9. Cities across Canada are taking proactive measures to develop Gender-Based
Violence Prevention Strategies, often in partnership with community agencies,
advocacy organizations, and law enforcement, to address the rising rates of
intimate partner violence and related safety concerns; and
10. Numerous reports, recommendations, and memorandums have been written on
Gender-Based Violence and Gender-Based Violence Prevention, yet little
concrete action has occurred to meaningfully prevent Gender-Based Violence.4 5
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to prepare a memo to Council in advance of the 2025
16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence outlining:
a. Ongoing national, provincial, and municipal initiatives addressing gender-
based violence;
b. Opportunities for the City of Vancouver to participate in or amplify public
awareness campaigns; and
c. Recommended options for a City statement or public commitment
reaffirming Council’s dedication to ending gender-based violence and
supporting those affected by it.
B. THAT Council direct staff to develop recommendations for a City of Vancouver
Gender-Based Violence Prevention Strategy, including but not limited to:
a. Establishing a Gender-Based Violence Prevention Task Force composed
of representatives from the City, the Vancouver Police Department,
community-based organizations, survivors, and subject-matter experts,
and ensuring that the drafting of the Task Force’s Terms of Reference be
co-developed with the Women’s Advisory Committee;
b. Identifying opportunities for collaboration with other levels of government,
Indigenous leadership, and regional partners;
c. Reviewing best practices from other municipalities and existing provincial
and federal frameworks;

and recommendations; and

f. Focusing on actualizing a prevention strategy oriented through specific
deliverables such as community safety and wellbeing, housing, justice,

C. THAT Council direct staff to report back to Council with the budgetary
requirements to complete A and B above.

partner violence, which has resulted in 33 deaths across British Columbia this year, and to
broader concerns about gender-based violence and equity. The motion directs staff to prepare a
memo to Council in advance of the 16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence, and
calls for the creation of a Gender-Based Violence Prevention Task Force and the development
of a City-wide strategy to strengthen prevention, coordination, and accountability across sectors.
Further, this motion follows the example set by other municipalities, such as the City of
Burnaby’s Community Safety and Wellbeing Plan addressing gender-based discrimination and
the City of Prince George’s resolution at the 2025 UBCM Convention on the Gender Based and
Intimate Partner Violence Epidemic.
