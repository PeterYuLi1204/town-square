Minutes, January 31, 2023 4
Council heard from five speakers in support of the motion and one speaker who spoke on other
aspects of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Carr
SECONDED by Councillor Boyle
WHEREAS
1. Vancouver, like cities and countries around the world, is facing an Increasing
numbers of record-breaking extreme weather events, including heat waves,
droughts, floods and storms. Extreme weather is evidence of Earth's rapidly
changing climate, which is detailed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC) (see https://www.ipcc.ch/report/sixth-assessment-report-working-
group-3/; and
https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGII_Summar
yForPolicymakers.pdf);
2. Accelerating climate change is putting people, infrastructure, economies and
natural ecosystems at increasing risk as evidenced by the death of 99
Vancouverites in the 2021 "heat dome", storm damage to Vancouver's sea wall
and Kitsilano pool, disruptions to supply chains, and loss of trees; (see
https://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/stanley-parks-trees-pushed-to-the-
brink-by-drought-moths;
3. Climate change is also increasing the burden of costs for municipal governments.
According to the Federation of Canadian Municipalities (FCM), local
governments own and are responsible for about 60% of public infrastructure. A
2020 report by the FCM and the Insurance Bureau of Canada, noted that climate
adaptation is estimated to cost municipalities $5. 3 billion annually. (see
https://fcm.ca/en/news-media/news-release/climate-adaptation-estimated-cost-
municipalities-5-billion-
annually#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20report's%20findings,to%200.26%2
5%20of%20Canada's%20GDP). In a report released November 30, 2022, the
total economic costs of the extreme weather events that BC experienced in 2021
are between $10.6 and $17.1 billion (see: A Climate Reckoning | Canadian
Centre for Policy Alternatives;
4. Scientists are imploring every political jurisdiction to ramp up its efforts to reduce
its GHGs, rapidly reduce the use of fossil fuels and increase renewable energy
(see: UN climate report: It's 'now or never' to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees
https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/04/1115452; and
https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/powering-safer-future; and
https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/05/1118452;
5. Although the City of Vancouver is committed to reducing by 50% its GHG
emissions over 2007 levels by 2030 and achieving net zero emissions by 2050 -
-commitments that are in line with globally-agreed-to targets negotiated by the
UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties -- we have only reduced our
emissions by 15 percent to date (see: https://vancouver.ca/files/cov/2021-ceap-
annual-report.pdf);

Council Meeting
Minutes, January 31, 2023 5
6. In Vancouver, 57 percent of our emissions come from burning gas in buildings
and 37 percent from transportation. The uptake in Vancouver is high for the
purchase of Zero Emission Vehicles (ZEVs): 12% of 2020-2021 vehicles sold. By
2030 all new construction will be net zero emission. The city's Climate
Emergency Action Plan also will require all current buildings to be retrofit to net
zero emission by 2050. Vancouver is able to be a leader in climate-smart
buildings due to our own building code as well as our investment in the training of
contractors and tradespeople through the Vancouver-initiated Zero Emissions
Building Exchange (ZEBX) and Metro Vancouver Zero Emissions Innovation
Center. In addition, the city accelerated uptake in installation of heat pumps by
offering matching grants to the provincial rebates for heat pumps;
7. Both EVs and building retrofits, including the installation of heat pumps, EV
charging and electric hot water heating, are creating increased demand for
electricity supply. However, B.C. Hydro's Five-Year Electrification Plan, released
by the government in September of 2021, estimates that it has sufficient supply
of clean electricity, including from Site C dam, only to 2030;
8. Motions submitted by the City of Vancouver for consideration by the Union of BC
Municipalities (UBCM) related to pursuing distributed renewable energy were
passed by consensus or near-consensus at UBCM's September 2022
Convention, specifically:
a. That the Government of B.C. pursue as quickly as possible adding
financial incentives, including increased feed-in-tariffs, for home and
building owners to install solar photovoltaic panels and solar-hot-water
systems, and modify the B.C. Building Code, and include in a future BC.
Existing Buildings Alterations Code specifications including design and
placement standards, and load-bearing requirements for solar
(photovoltaic) panels and solar hot water systems;
b. That the Government of British Columbia support and provide funding for
training programs for workers deep energy retrofits and construction of
deeply affordable climate-smart housing, including installing solar panels,
solar hot water systems and heat pumps;
9. Recognizing the need to quickly shift to renewable energy, other jurisdictions are
requiring solar energy production. For example, starting in 2023 Berlin is
requiring solar panel (PV) installations for all new buildings and major
renovations. Copenhagen, due to its district energy system and green electricity
grid which is largely powered by wind energy, is aiming to be net carbon neutral
by 2025. Also, 802 cities in Europe have re-purchased private utility companies
to green their grids and keep consumer costs low. And in November, 2022,
France announced that it will require all parking lots with 80 or more spaces to be
covered by solar panels. See: https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/03/parking-lots-
becoming-as-important-as-cars-in-climate-change-efforts.html#;
10. If installed properly, rooftop solar applications are synergistic with greens roofs,
which are currently required in Vancouver on large commercial and institutional
buildings but may in future be required on other buildings types as part of

Council Meeting
Minutes, January 31, 2023 6
Vancouver’s Rain City Strategy and Climate Emergency Action Plan. See Photo
Voltaic on Green Roofs – the Scandinavian Way (livingarchitecturemonitor.com);
11. Solar photovoltaic systems would not only help meet the increasing demand for
renewable electricity but, together with solar hot water systems, would greatly
reduce energy costs for families and businesses.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Vancouver City Council direct staff to:
a. Consult with appropriate agencies including BC Hydro, renewable energy
experts, and relevant contractor and trades worker associations, including
Metro Vancouver Zero Emissions Innovation Centre (ZEIC), regarding
how best to expedite increasing the supply of renewable energy in
Vancouver;
b. Consult with the appropriate B.C. government ministries regarding their
timelines and processes for implementing the renewable energy-related
motions tabled by the City of Vancouver and passed unanimously or
near-unanimously at the 2022 UBCM convention, including provincial
requirements for installation of renewable energy systems, training of
installers, and consumer rebates for solar PVC and solar hot water
systems;
c. Evaluate the potential of different types of renewable energy, including
solar photovoltaic systems, solar hot water systems, wind and renewable
district energy systems, to reduce Vancouver city’s GHGs, increase
reliability of energy supply and reduce consumers’ energy costs;
d. Determine changes that would be needed in the Vancouver Building
By-law and other by-laws, policies and codes to enable expanding
renewable energy production in Vancouver; and
e. Report back to Council by Q4 2023 with results of the above work and a
plan that includes options, costs and benefits, and timelines for the City of
Vancouver to aggressively pursue increasing production of renewable
energy within city limits.

2. Piloting a Culturally Appropriate, Indigenous-led Supportive Housing and
Wellness Centre Project in Partnership with Indigenous Peoples
MOVED by Councillor Bligh
SECONDED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
WHEREAS
1. In July 2014, The City of Vancouver officially became a City of Reconciliation
with the formal adoption – on July 8, 2014 – of a Reconciliation Framework
pursuant to and resulting from the June 2013 Council declaration of a “Year of
Reconciliation in Vancouver”;
2. Since July 2014, the City and successive Councils have created new policies to
support Reconciliation efforts. Council continues to explore ways to work toward
Reconciliation with the Musqueam, Squamish, and Tsleil-Waututh Nations, and
the urban Indigenous communities and peoples living in Vancouver; i
3. The City of Vancouver has the third largest urban Indigenous population of any
Canadian city, and there is a longstanding recognition of the need for
Indigenous-specific programs and services in the city that are able to provide
traditional, spiritual, and cultural health and healing supports, notably, but not
exclusively, in the Downtown East Side (DTES); ii
4. The Reconciliation goals of the City include establishing and maintaining
mutually respectful relationships between Indigenous and non-Indigenous
peoples and to respect the rights of the local First Nations and urban Indigenous
peoples; iii
5. The City of Vancouver has an Urban Indigenous Peoples' Advisory Committee,
the mandate of which is to advise Council and City staff on enhancing access
and inclusion for urban Indigenous Peoples and enabling their full participation in
City services and civic life;
6. The City of Vancouver recognizes that Indigenous populations in Vancouver
experience some of the greatest systemic inequities in health and well being, and
that the systems, methods, concepts, and indicators used to understand these
inequities must themselves be created and grounded in the knowledge‐ within
Indigenous communities, rather than being imposed from outside;
7. The 2016 census estimated that 61,455 Indigenous persons live in Metro
Vancouver, with the City of Vancouver having the largest urban Indigenous
population in the region with nearly 14,000 people counted in the census
(potentially an undercount due to the fact that many census respondents
reportedly do not self identify);
8. Within the City of Van‐couver, the largest numbers of Indigenous residents live in
central and north eastern neighbourhoods, with Strathcona and
Grandview Woodland having the largest percentage of population identifying as
Indigenous; ‐
‐

Council Meeting
Minutes, January 31, 2023 21
9. Access to traditional, culturally appropriate, and safe health care practices are
believed to be equally, if not more important, than access to mainstream non-
Indigenous health care. Indigenous concepts of wellness are distinct from
western notions of wellness, and are unique to each Indigenous community’s
respective worldview. As such, there is a growing recognition of the need for
indicators – such as those in the City’s Healthy City Strategy (HCS) – that reflect
Indigenous notions of wellness;
10. The province’s First Nations Health Authority (FNHA) has the formal mandate to
plan, design, manage, and fund the delivery of First Nations health programs
across BC and actively works to transform and reform the way health care is
delivered to Indigenous people in BC. The FNHA is committed to supporting
Indigenous individuals, families, and communities in achieving the highest level
of health and wellness;
11. The FNHA subscribes to the belief that wellness starts with individuals who then
influence their families, who then influence their communities, who in turn
influence their regions. Each “champion of wellness” has circles of influence
through connections in their family, in their work, and in their own communities.
Wellness can be championed by sharing the history of Indigenous wellness,
sharing one’s own stories, persisting through setbacks, and shifting focus from
Illness to Wellness;
12. Vancouver Coastal Health (VCH) is likewise committed to supporting the journey
of reconciliation with Indigenous peoples in the region and is committed to
improving the health of and access to culturally safe healthcare for the
Indigenous people in the health region. The VCH Indigenous Health team
collaborates, coordinates, and integrates their health programs and services with
FNHA to achieve better health outcomes for Indigenous peoples;
13. The April 2022 “City of Vancouver Housing Needs Report” notes that Indigenous
households face unique housing challenges and are disproportionately more
likely to be renters than owners, with almost half of Indigenous households
spending 30% or more of their income on shelter. Homelessness and housing
insecurity remain significant issues in Vancouver, with Indigenous persons
overrepresented among those experiencing homelessness. Responses to
Indigenous housing needs are reflected in work of local First Nations and groups
such as the Aboriginal Housing Management Association (AHMA) which
advocate for partnerships to deliver secure, affordable housing for Indigenous
people in Vancouver and the region;
14. The City of Vancouver is committed to strengthening its relationship with urban
Indigenous organizations and community groups that offer culturally appropriate
services to the urban Indigenous peoples living in Vancouver;
15. The City of Vancouver has an “Indigenous Healing and Wellness Grants”
program that supports projects that provide for traditional, spiritual and cultural
healing and wellness activities in Vancouver's urban Indigenous community;

Council Meeting
Minutes, January 31, 2023 22
16. Culturally appropriate, Indigenous-led supportive housing and wellness project
examples in the city that the City of Vancouver has been involved in include the
Aboriginal Land Trust project at 52-92 E Hastings, Women Deliver Project, and
the UNYA redevelopment project;
17. There are potentially other projects in the city, either being developed by the City
or by other organizations, which might offer additional opportunities to deliver
culturally appropriate, Indigenous-led supportive housing and wellness centres.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to report back by the end of
Q2 of 2023 with a review of options and opportunities to deliver new culturally
appropriate, Indigenous-led supportive housing and wellness centre projects in the city
in partnership with Indigenous peoples, including information regarding potential
contributions to these projects by the City (e.g., land, funding, other support, etc.);
FURTHER THAT staff be directed to consult with all relevant stakeholders on the
relevant options and opportunities for projects, including but not limited to consultation
with the xwməθkwəy̓əm (Musqueam Indian Band), Sḵwx̱wú7mesh (Squamish Nation),
sə̓ lílwətaʔɬ (Tsleil-Waututh Nation), the city’s urban Indigenous communities and
peoples, the City’s Urban Indigenous Peoples' Advisory Committee, the FNHA, VCH, the

(UNYA), and other urban Indigenous organizations and community groups that offer
culturally appropriate, Indigenous-led supportive housing and wellness services in the
city and region generally.

3. Industrial Modernization and Intensification Framework Development Process
Update
MOVED by Mayor Sim
SECONDED by Councillor Fry
WHEREAS
1. In October 2020, Vancouver City Council received an Employment Lands and
Economy Review report from City staff;
2. The Employment Lands and Economy Review included forecasts showing that,
over the long term, the city is facing a potential gap between anticipated demand
and potential supply. Under a high demand scenario, the city could face a gap of
up to ~1.2M sq. ft. by 2051;
3. Technological innovations are fundamentally changing the relationship between
employment, productivity, and how industrial lands are occupied and used. Many
new businesses, notably industrial tech and high tech businesses, do not fit
neatly within the traditional paradigm of ‘heavy’ or ‘light’ industrial use and may
also be less impactful in terms of external nuisances while exhibiting non-
traditional levels of employment density;
4. Providing for and maintaining space to accommodate industrial businesses and
services, especially in the context of the rapidly changing nature of industrial
activities and the importance of new technology and high tech industries, is vital
to the economic well-being of our city and its success, prosperity, and
sustainability;
5. As the preferred location for employers in the region, and with more than half of
the city’s jobs located on only 10% of the land, Vancouver’s employment lands –
particularly the city’s industrial lands – are under tremendous pressure from
competing needs for space. This has led to rising commercial and industrial rents
in high demand areas and is leading some industrial businesses, and the jobs
they provide, to leave the city;
6. The desired space needs, location preferences, and associated employment and
transportation requirements are becoming more diverse and specialized,
particularly for technology businesses and tech industry land uses, amid the
rapidly evolving nature of business and industrial activities in the city;
7. City staff have outlined a number of ways in which the city’s limited industrial land
supply can be used more efficiently, including intensification of built forms where
local development restrictions, geotechnical / soil conditions, and market factors
permit;
8. The City has a draft Industrial intensification and Modernization Framework that
is intended to provide overarching guidance for the future of Vancouver’s
industrial lands, including work on recommended regulatory and policy changes
that will be brought forward to implement the framework;

Council Meeting
Minutes, January 31, 2023 24
9. In November 2021, Mayor and Council received an update memo from the
General Manager of Planning, Urban Design and Sustainability (Industrial
Modernization and Intensification Framework). The memo made note of staff’s
ongoing program of work toward the development of a comprehensive policy
framework for modernizing and intensifying Vancouver’s industrial areas and
advancing key directions identified in the City of Vancouver’s Employment Lands
and Economy Review (“ELER”), as well as key directions in the Metro Vancouver
Regional Industrial Lands Strategy (“MVRILS”);
10. The City’s draft Industrial Intensification and Modernization Framework includes
information regarding a series of incremental changes to facilitate the
intensification of industrial land use in the city in support of employment growth
over the long term;
11. The Framework reportedly has four key objectives:
i. Protect industrial lands for employment use;
ii. Enable balanced industrial intensification;
iii. Facilitate the right users in the right spaces;
iv. Monitor, Coordinate and Report on industrial change;
12. The economic well-being of our city and its ongoing future success, prosperity,
and sustainability require that we provide for and maintain spaces to
accommodate industrial activities, businesses, and services to support
employment growth, bring jobs closer to people’s homes, reduce commute times,
lessen the negative impacts of industrial rent price escalation over the long term,
as we incrementally intensify, preserve, and even expand the city’s industrial
lands.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to report back by the end of
Q3 2023 with an update on the Industrial Modernization and Intensification Framework
development process, including information regarding any additional resources required
to advance key directions identified in the City of Vancouver’s Employment Lands and
Economy Review (“ELER”), as well as key directions identified in the Metro Vancouver
Regional Industrial Lands Strategy (“MVRILS”);
FURTHER THAT staff be directed to include specific information for Council in the
update report regarding:
i. potential opportunities and/or strategies to accelerate the Framework’s
development process, as well as challenges to date;
ii. staff recommendations to limit land speculation on the city’s vitally important,
and limited industrial land base;
iii. an overview of regulatory and policy changes that could potentially be
brought forward and considered by Council to facilitate the modernization,
preservation, and intensification of the city’s industrial and employment lands,
including advice on any need to impose a moratorium on the rezoning of
existing industrial lands for other land uses and an evaluation of the

Council Meeting
Minutes, January 31, 2023 25
concept/principle of one-for-one and two-for-one land swaps similar to
provisions in ALR policy;
iv. a general current state overview of the city’s industrial lands and any
challenges faced by the City’s and staff’s efforts to date to preserve
employment and industrial lands and spaces in the city, particularly those
industrial and employment lands supported by rapid transit (planned and/or
existing rapid transit and major transit routes).

4. Supporting and Expanding Vancouver’s Tech Hubs, Clusters, and Districts
MOVED by Mayor Sim
SECONDED by Councillor Meiszner
WHEREAS
1. The City of Vancouver is widely recognized as the economic and cultural centre
of the rapidly growing Metro Vancouver region, with globally recognized
strengths in many key tech sectors including film and television, clean-tech and
climate solutions, life sciences, tourism, arts, and culture;
2. Vancouver is home to 34 percent of the region’s jobs and has more than 1,100
high tech businesses representing 40% of all high tech businesses in the region,
with the largest cluster located in downtown Vancouver accounting for 1/5 of all
high tech businesses in the region;
3. Technological innovations are fundamentally changing the relationship between
employment, productivity, and how industrial and employment lands are
occupied and used;
4. Many emerging tech and industrial tech businesses and their land use do not fit
neatly within the traditional paradigm of ‘heavy’ or ‘light’ industrial use and may
also be less impactful in terms of external nuisances while exhibiting and
supporting non-traditional levels of employment density;

Council Meeting
Minutes, January 31, 2023 26
5. The tech sector encompasses a wide range of activities including light
manufacturing, media and digital entertainment production, clean-tech and
biotech, software and hardware design, and various other uses;
6. The city of Vancouver is quickly becoming known as a preeminent North
American tech hub with “world-class talent and few immigration headaches” as
well as “great views in a convenient time zone.”;
7. Tech companies of all shapes and sizes, including “major players” like Microsoft,
Amazon, Apple, Cisco Systems, Samsung, SAP, and Zenefits, are choosing
Vancouver as a place to do technology business;
8. According to British price-comparison website Money.co.uk, Vancouver was
recently ranked as the No. 7 tech city in world, reportedly higher than any other
city outside the U.S., based on earnings, number of startups, and pedigree of
local universities. The quest for educated workers, and access to top-tier
universities, is one of the factors that give Vancouver competitive edge over
other cities as a global tech hub;
9. The space needs of tech businesses can vary widely, but typically require a
diversity of spaces at different scales, including offices, production space, and
logistical facilities;
10. High tech hubs and clusters drive innovation and entrepreneurship supported by
access to capital, knowledge, and talent;
11. Vancouver’s tech sector is supported by a first-class education system that is
graduating tomorrow’s tech leaders and innovators from top-calibre institutions
and speciality schools;
12. Vancouver is an emerging centre for Artificial Intelligence (AI) with over 64 AI
companies thanks to an already established talent pool in visual computing and
graphics;
13. Some of the best schools for software development and AI are located in
Vancouver, including UBC which is ranked as the number 2 tech school in
Canada, and in the top 25 in the world according to the QS World University
Ranking;
14. The City of Vancouver, as part of a unified vision for future land use in the city,
notably as articulated in the Vancouver Plan and Broadway Plan, is committed to
protecting, expanding, and supporting industrial and employment land areas,
business districts, campus institutions, and a broad and diverse base of jobs and
services in the city;
15. As the preferred location for employers in the region, and with more than half of
the city’s jobs located on only 10% of the land, Vancouver’s employment lands –
particularly the city’s industrial lands – are under tremendous pressure from
competing needs for space which has led to rising commercial and industrial
rents in high demand areas;

Council Meeting
Minutes, January 31, 2023 27
16. City staff have indicated that efforts currently underway to support the tech sector
and preserve employment and industrial lands and spaces supported by transit
(particularly regional rapid transit initiatives), not only include the Broadway
corridor but are also reflected in the Rupert and Renfrew industrial lands planning
processes;
17. In November 2021, the then Mayor and Council received an update memo from
the General Manager of Planning, Urban Design and Sustainability (Industrial
Modernization and Intensification Framework) regarding staff’s ongoing program
of work toward the development of a comprehensive policy framework for
modernizing and intensifying Vancouver’s industrial areas and advancing key
directions identified in the City of Vancouver’s Employment Lands and Economy
Review (“ELER”), as well as key directions in the Metro Vancouver Regional
Industrial Lands Strategy (“MVRILS”);
18. The economic well-being of our city and its ongoing future success, prosperity,
and sustainability require that we not only have strategies to provide for, expand,
and maintain lands and spaces to accommodate traditional industrial activities
and businesses, but that we also ensure that we secure spaces for the
integration and growth of high tech hubs and clusters in the city that drive
innovation and entrepreneurship in the city’s tech ecosystem and are
well-supported by access to capital, knowledge, and talent.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to explore strategies to
facilitate and aggregate new and existing tech hubs and clusters in the city and for staff
to report back by the end of Q3 2023 with recommendations and strategic directions for
Council to consider to ensure that spaces for integrating and growing high tech hubs and
clusters in the city, whether they be in the city’s traditional industrial lands or located in
new and/or renewing areas, are suitably reflected in the City’s planning processes so
that Vancouver can sustainably attract and support 21st century economic activities to
drive innovation, collaboration, and entrepreneurship within and surrounding the city’s
evolving tech ecosystem;
FURTHER THAT staff be directed to co-ordinate their recommendations and strategic
direction advice to Council, and otherwise integrate these within, the context of staff’s
ongoing program of work toward the development of a comprehensive policy framework
for modernizing and intensifying Vancouver’s industrial areas and advancing key
directions identified in the City of Vancouver’s Employment Lands and Economy Review
(“ELER”), as well as key directions in the Metro Vancouver Regional Industrial Lands
