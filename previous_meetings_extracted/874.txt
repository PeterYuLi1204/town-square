Council Meeting

CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY
B. Council Members’ Motions
1. Requests for Leaves of Absence
MOVED by Councillor Hardwick
SECONDED by Councillor Wiebe
THAT Councillor Dominato be granted a Leave of Absence for personal reasons from
meetings between 4:30 and 7:30pm, on Tuesday, December 10, 2019;
FURTHER THAT Councillor Dominato be granted a Leave of Absence for personal
reasons from meetings between 4:30 and 8 pm, on Wednesday, December 11, 2019;
AND FURTHER THAT Councillor Dominato be granted a Leave of Absence for personal

CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY (Vote No. 05263)
(Councillor Dominato absent for the vote)
2. Slowing the Loss of the Last Low Income SROs in Vancouver
Prior to discussion, Council agreed to call the vote.
MOVED by Councillor Swanson
SECONDED by Councillor Hardwick
WHEREAS
1. Single Room Occupancy Hotels are designated under the Single Room
Accommodation By-Law (2003) which was enacted to discourage speculative
investment and slow the loss of affordability in this critical low-income housing
stock, 94% of which are located in the DTES;

Council Meeting
Minutes, December 10, 2019 43
2. Currently 180 SRO rooms in the DTES (The Avalon, St. Elmo, Pacific, and Arno)
are offered for sale and are at risk of being gentrified by a new owner who may
push existing low income residents out;
3. The city has already lost the affordability of hundreds of SRO units for low
income people because new owner/investors gradually get rid of low income
tenants, upgrade slightly, and increase rents by hundreds of dollars a month;
4. As the last rental home option before homelessness for many low-income
Vancouverites, the loss of affordable SRO units through room and building
closures and through increasing rents, is contributing to the inability of the City
and partners to catch up with and reduce homelessness in Vancouver and the
DTES;
5. The City’s SRO Revitalization Action Plan and Housing Vancouver (2017) called
for “a specific category in the Residential Tenancy Act for SRA-designated
properties by tying rent increases to the room as opposed to the tenant in an
effort to slow rent increases and tenant displacement
(https://vancouver.ca/files/cov/sro-revitalization-action-plan.pdf page 28);
6. By regulating rent changes, landlords would still be able to increase rent by the
allowable amount every year and would still be able to apply under section 23 of
the RTA regulations
(http://www.bclaws.ca/EPLibraries/bclaws_new/document/ID/freeside/10_477_20
03) for rent increases over the allowable amount due to unexpected costs; and
7. The province has not yet implemented the City’s recommendation and it is more
urgent than ever.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT City Council, through the Mayor and staff, urgently ask the provincial
government to tie rent increases to the rooms, not the tenancy in SRO
designated properties, in an effort to discourage speculative investment, slow
rent increases, and discourage displacement of very low income tenants into
homelessness.
B. THAT staff investigate alternate ways to meet the goals in A above, such as
using business licences and/or amendments to the SRA by-law that the City
Council could implement under their existing Vancouver Charter authority and
report back by Q2, 2020.
CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY (Vote No. 05288)

Council Meeting
Minutes, December 10, 2019 44
3. Review of Bill 21
MOVED by Councillor Dominato
SECONDED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
WHEREAS
1. In 2019, the Province of Quebec enacted Bill 21 (An Act Respecting the Laicity of
the State), which prohibits public servants from wearing religious symbols
including turbans, hijabs, yarmulke, the cross and others;
2. Vancouver celebrates multiculturalism and diversity as an inclusive city and is
home to many churches, gurdwaras, mosques, mundars, temples and other
places of gathering and worship;
3. The City of Vancouver is committed to diversity, equity, and access in all of its
programming and policies;
4. Freedom of Religion in Canada and BC is protected by the Canadian Charter of
Human Rights and Freedoms, the Canadian Human Rights Act, and the BC
Human Rights Code;
5. Disallowing citizens the right to fully participate and acknowledgement of their
religious practices fosters intolerance entrenched discrimination, and inequity;
6. Bill 21 discriminates and divides communities and creates barriers to
employment and services for some people of faith;
7. Big cities in Canada including Victoria, Calgary, Edmonton, Surrey, Brampton
and Toronto have expressed their support for equality and diversity with their
opposition to Bill 21;
8. Vancouver is the largest city in Metro Vancouver and third largest city in Canada
that welcomes people from all over the world;
9. The National Council of Canadian Muslims (NCMM), the Canadian Civil Liberties
Association (CCLA), the World Sikh Organization (WSO) and others have
initiated a constitutional challenge against Bill 21.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Vancouver City Council continues to support
diversity, equity, and access for all citizens and support in principle the legal challenge
against the discrimination of freedom of religion as set out in Quebec's Bill 21;
FURTHER THAT Council refer this motion to the Racial and Ethno-Cultural Equity
Advisory Committee for further consideration.
