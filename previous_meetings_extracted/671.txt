4. Solidarity with Indian Farmers (Member’s Motion B.3)
At the Council meeting on March 9, 2021, Council referred the above-noted motion to the
Standing Committee on Policy and Strategic Priorities meeting on March 10, 2021, in order to
hear from speakers.
On March 10, 2021, the Committee completed hearing from speakers and began debate.
Subsequently, as a motion to extend the meeting past 10 pm was lost, debate and decision on
this item continued at the Standing Committee on City Finance and Services meeting on
March 31, 2021, with the following amended motion on the floor:
MOVED by Councillor Swanson
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. The Indian government made changes to the agricultural laws without consulting
the farmer’s organizations;
2. These changes, in the opinion of the farmers, severely negatively impact their
livelihood by:
a) Not granting minimum support price in the law;
b) Allowing traders to stockpile product to create shortages in the market
place to increase price to the consumer;
c) Having dispute resolution between farmers and corporations under
contract farmers handled by a committee rather than the judicial system;
3. A majority of Indian farmers are small farmers looking after less than 5 acres of
land. They decide what they want to plant to meet their family needs rather than
plant crops to fulfill corporate needs;
4. More than 60% of the Indian population relies on farming;
5. Due to high unemployment in the unskilled labour pool, the livelihood of families
displaced by these laws will be severely negatively impacted;
6. The suicide rates amongst Indian farmers show the current fragility of the
agriculture industry, which is battling the effects of climate change and massive
crop failures;
7. During the ongoing protest in New Delhi the government is depriving the
protesters of basic necessities and is violating their basic human rights;
8. Lending our voice to support India’s farmers would lend support for the principle
that in Canada and around the world local farmers are indispensable to the social
fabric of any country must be supported and protected; and
9. The BC Provincial Government has joined all major federal political parties in
speaking out against these legislative changes.

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services

5. Understanding COVID-19 Recovery through Economic and Cultural Stimulus
Projects (Member’s Motion B.4)
At the Council meeting on March 9, 2021, Council referred the above-noted motion to the
Standing Committee on Policy and Strategic Priorities meeting on March 10, 2021, in order to
hear from speakers.
Subsequently, on March 10, 2021, a motion to extend the meeting past 10 pm and refer this
item to a future meeting was lost; therefore, this item was considered at the Standing
Committee on City Finance and Services meeting on March 31, 2021.
As the registered speakers had since withdrawn, the Committee began debate.
MOVED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. Economic decline in 2020 in BC real GDP growth was negative six percent
(-6.0%);
2. COVID-19 has adversely impacted Vancouver’s economy and dramatically
increased local unemployment rates with an estimated 32,000 jobs lost since
February 2020 – many of which are in the construction industry;
3. The unemployment rate in BC is forecast to remain high at 6.8% in BC in 2021
according to the Business Council of BC;
4. Employment and revenue has dropped notably in the arts and cultural sector
which has been one of the hardest hit due to the closure of performance venues
and COVID safety restrictions; specific segments of the retail trade have also
suffered;
5. Vancouver’s Culture|Shift plan and vision for arts, culture and creativity sets
Vancouver’s first arts and cultural space targets including a goal for 800,000
square feet of new, repurposed or expanded, affordable City-owned, non-profit
and private space over the next ten years;
6. Vancouver City Council’s COVID-19 Recovery Committee report identifies
economic recovery as a priority recovery theme;
7. As is the case with accelerating affordable and rental housing construction, the
construction of commercial and cultural revitalization projects, including
expanded cultural space projects, could have an equally positive impact on
Vancouver’s COVID-19 recovery and would present similar opportunities to
assist with the creation of a “new, better ‘normal’” for our city;
8. Information relevant to the construction of new commercial projects and new or
revitalized cultural projects, including expanded cultural space, has direct impact
on the speed and strength of Vancouver’s COVID-19 economic recovery;

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, March 31, 2021 10
9. Private and non-profit entities may have potentially submitted proposals that do
not fall under established rezoning enabling policy that may help to meet
unemployment challenges and contribute to the creation of a “new, better
‘normal’” for our city;
10. Obtaining information with respect to new commercial and new or cultural
revitalization projects, including new or expanded cultural space, is needed for
council to properly assess opportunities for economic and cultural stimulus in our
city and how these projects might positively impact Vancouver’s COVID-19
recovery.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to report back with a memo (and attached Excel
searchable and sortable pre-application list), prepared in accordance with the
Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act, identifying potential
commercial projects and new cultural or cultural revitalization projects, including
new or expanded cultural space, for all letters of enquiry, pre-enquiries and
informal expressions of interest (excluding those projects for which established
rezoning-enabling policy currently applies) by the end of Q1 2021 (or as soon as
possible) and to be updated quarterly;
FURTHER THAT such information would include:
1. Project proponent
2. Project address
3. Pre-application enquiry type (i.e. LOE, pre-enquiry, informal EOI)
4. Submission date
5. Approximate number of buildings included in proposed project
6. Proposed office, industrial or retail square footage
7. Proposed rehearsal, production or performance/show space square
footage
8. Associated economic activity including project value, number of
construction jobs, number office jobs, number cultural jobs, number
industrial jobs, retail spend, cultural spend, etc. as applicable
9. Paying-for-growth opportunities:
a. Fixed rate CAC (Yes/No/Don’t Know)
b. Negotiated CAC (Yes/No/Don’t Know)
c. DCLs and UDCLS (Yes/No/Don’t Know)
d. In-Kind or other community benefits (Yes/No/Don’t Know)

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, March 31, 2021 11
B. THAT Council acknowledge that the above-referenced information is likely
confidential and proprietary and therefore is likely to be provided only In Camera,
and therefore not available for posting or communication to the public.
C. THAT staff advise what data on an individual project basis or in aggregate may
be made public from the provided information.
CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY (Vote No. 07128)
(Councillor Dominato absent for the vote)
6. Don’t Feed the Wildlife (Member’s Motion B.6)
At the Council meeting on March 9, 2021, Council referred the above-noted motion to the
Standing Committee on Policy and Strategic Priorities meeting on March 10, 2021, in order to
hear from speakers.
Subsequently, on March 10, 2021, a motion to extend the meeting past 10 pm and refer this
item to a future meeting was lost; therefore, this item was considered at the Standing
Committee on City Finance and Services meeting March 31, 2021.
* * * * *
Prior to hearing from speakers, the Committee recessed at 4:23 pm
and reconvened at 4:32 pm.
* * * * *
The Committee heard from two speakers in support of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Fry
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. The City of Vancouver enjoys proximity to a spectacular natural environment with
an abundance of natural wildlife species that coexist within our urban ecosystem,
including: bald eagles, bats, beavers, coyotes, harbour seals, otters, raccoons,
skunks, squirrels, and a variety of birds;
2. Wild animals in the urban ecosystem often engage in opportunistic feeding, the
taking of food without marked preferences as it becomes available. Humans, as
the source of opportunistic feeding, often indulge this behaviour in an effort to
admire or interact with wild animals;
3. Wild animals can suffer when they get used to eating human food instead of their
natural diet. When people feed wildlife, the animals become habituated and can
lose their healthy fear of people, this increases their chances of being injured or
killed. Feeding wildlife can also directly or indirectly cause aggression in animals,
attract vermin and other pests, and transmit diseases;

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, March 31, 2021 12
4. Within the City of Vancouver the feeding of wildlife is variously regulated and
prohibited on land, at sea, and in parks by:
a. BC Wildlife Act 1 Section 33.1(1)(a)(b) stating: A person must not
intentionally feed or attempt to feed dangerous wildlife, or provide, leave
or place an attractant in, on or about any land or premises with the intent
of attracting dangerous wildlife. Where “dangerous wildlife” is defined as
bear, cougar, coyote or wolf;
b. Canada Fisheries Act Marine Mammal Regulations 2 stating: No person
shall disturb a marine mammal, including approaching the marine
mammal, or attempt to feed it;
c. Parks Control by-law 3 indirectly prohibits feeding wildlife in parks through
section 14(l) stating: No person shall deposit food or grain on any area in
a park except in litter cans provided by the Board for the purpose of
receiving garbage and litter
5. The City of Vancouver has no municipal by-law directly prohibiting the feeding of
wild animals, although Street and Traffic By-law No. 2849 4 does restrict littering
on streets and has been partially relied on for the enforcement of feeding wild
animals in the city;
6. Victoria, BC, through its Animal Control By-law 5 explicitly prohibits the feeding of
deers, raccoons, squirrels or rabbits anywhere in the City, and additionally
pigeons, crows and gulls within a prohibited downtown core area;
7. In Vancouver, public education and enforcement around feeding of wildlife in the
urban ecosystem is inconsistent and ineffective:
a. Vancouver residents feeding wild visitors to their yards or outdoor spaces
have resulted in injuries to people and pets, for example from 2017 at 1st
and Arbutus a woman and her dogs attacked by food-habituated and
aggressive raccoons: “Vancouver woman attacked by raccoons says
they’re being fed by a neighbour” 6 (2017, Global BC);
b. Indiscriminate bird feeding in public spaces (including but not limited to
parks and schoolyards) has been observed to lead to an increase in rats
and other opportunistic feeders;
c. In recent months, a number of aggressive coyote interactions in Stanley
Park have resulted in bites, trail closures, and a number of coyotes being
euthanized. According to the Park Board, "Aggressive behaviour is often
the result of animals being fed by people." As of February 22, 2021, there
have been 15 attacks by coyotes in Stanley Park, though to date no
deaths or serious injuries;
8. In response to a Freedom of Information request from the Fur-Bearers
organization there have been no tickets (fines and warnings) issued by
Vancouver By-law Officers, regarding wildlife feeding in Stanley Park, between
January 1, 2018 to January 19, 2021. Similarly, the Board of Parks and
Recreation confirms there are no responsive records for the same time period.

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, March 31, 2021 13
There have been no fines from BC’s Conservation Office for feeding coyotes;
9. The BC SPCA encourages municipalities to adopt bylaws that prohibit intentional
wildlife feeding and encourage the management of wildlife attractants as
unintentional feeding sources.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council directs staff to report back on Council’s authority to prepare a
by-law to prohibit intentional wildlife feeding, and encourage the management of
wildlife attractants as unintentional feeding sources, pursuant to Vancouver’s
authority to create by-laws for preventing, abating, and prohibiting nuisance or
other authority;
FURTHER THAT, if authorized by the Vancouver Charter or other authority, staff
prepare for consideration a by-law that includes terms such as:
a. No person shall knowingly or willingly feed any wildlife, or in any manner
provide them or allow access to food or any other edible substance;
b. No person shall store any attractant or waste in such a manner that it is
accessible to wildlife;
c. No person shall attract wildlife onto a property such that these wildlife
create a nuisance for other properties; and
d. Exemptions for hummingbird feeding by way of liquid feeders, and
songbird feeding by way of wildlife-proof feeders (specifically designed to
prevent access by squirrels and rats).
B. THAT subject to Council’s approval of A above, staff consider and prepare
amendments to the Ticket Offences By-law No. 9360 to create a ticket offence
for intentional wildlife feeding.
C. THAT subject to Council’s approval of A above, and the enactment of any
proposed by-laws, staff prepare appropriate signage when and where necessary
to promote the new by-law with updated, clear and easy to comprehend signage
in areas where feeding is common.
D. THAT upon enactment of any new by-laws contemplated by A and B above, City
staff share this information with the Vancouver Board of Parks and Recreation,
CMHC Granville Island Administration, and Vancouver School Board District 39
for their consideration.

7. Increasing Public Access to Information about False Creek South (Member’s
Motion B.2)
The Committee heard from two speakers in support of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Swanson
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. In principle, as much City information as possible should be made public, unless
there’s a legal reason not to make it public, as outlined in Section 165.2 of the
Vancouver Charter; and
2. Many residents of False Creek south are worried that too many decisions about
their neighbourhood will be made In Camera.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT staff examine reports regarding the future of South False Creek, including
negotiations, consultations and visioning with area residents and residents of
other parts of the city, and options for decisions, to determine which components
relate to City policies that must be public, and which are more appropriately
discussed at a closed meeting of Council.
B. THAT staff ensure that reports and information that can legally be made public
are made public.

8. Turning Construction Hoarding into a Canvas for Public Art in Vancouver
(Member’s Motion B.3)
The Committee heard from two speakers in support of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. A quality public realm helps deliver dynamic, engaging and active urban and
neighbourhood experiences at a human scale. It can encourage people to use

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, March 31, 2021 15
sustainable transportation modes – to walk, cycle or use transit – by creating
accessible and memorable spaces;
2. Vancouver's public spaces – our plazas, squares, streets, laneways, pathways,
and waterfront – are where public life happens. These spaces are where we
connect with the city and with each other. They are where community is created;
3. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on our city. Every resident
and every business has struggled or had to adapt. Vancouver’s response to the
pandemic has been significant focusing on supporting and accelerating economic
and community recovery, and on helping people, organizations and businesses
recover and move forward;
4. The City of Vancouver and Vancouver City Council consider arts and culture to
be vitally important to the city’s liveability, and recognize the value the arts bring
to the lives of residents and our city. The sector has been one of the hardest hit
by the pandemic;
5. Vancouver is a city that prides itself on being alive with creativity, offering music,
dance, new media, theatre, festivals, film, design, exhibitions, galleries,
museums, and special events. The City encourages people to “Go out and
explore arts and culture in Vancouver.”;
6. In September 2019, Council approved a new culture plan. Culture|Shift:
Blanketing the City in Arts and Culture provides a framework with strategic
directions and actions that seeks to include previously under-represented voices
and constituencies, build partnerships across communities and sectors, and
develop strategies that place arts and culture at the forefront;
7. The City’s support for public art takes many forms with a variety of Public Art
Programs that support excellence in public art by emerging and established
artists, in new and traditional media, and through award-winning commissions
and artist collaborations that produce contemporary art for public spaces
throughout the city;
8. In May 2020, amid the challenges presented by the pandemic, Council and the
City reaffirmed Vancouver’s commitment to supporting arts and culture during
this crisis and noted that supporting artists and arts and culture organizations in
our community continues to be a priority;
9. In terms of the economic standing of the arts and artists in Vancouver, the
Employment Lands and Economy Review research conducted by the City last
year noted that Vancouver "has the highest concentration of artists per capita of
major cities with 8,800 artists making up 2.4% of the local labour force.” The
majority of artists live under the poverty line with 63 percent of artists reporting an
income of less than $40,000 per year. The median income of Vancouver artists is
$22,116, which is 44 percent less than all Vancouver workers. These workers
face multiple barriers to participating in the Vancouver economy – the effects of
COVID-19 have only added additional hardship for this sector;

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, March 31, 2021 16
10. In response to the challenges brought about by COVID-19 and social distancing
requirements, a wide variety of public art expressions emerged serving as a
beacon of hope and connection. For example, the Robson Street Business
Association, Downtown Vancouver Business Improvement Association, and
South Granville Business Improvement Association worked early on during the
pandemic with the Vancouver Mural Festival to connect artists with business
owners in order to create murals on temporary hoarding on storefronts that were
forced to close due to COVID-19. Plain plywood was transformed into colourful
murals and city streets became outdoor public art galleries;
11. In addition to support from local BIAs for hoarding murals and expressions of
public art during the pandemic, the City of Vancouver and other sponsors helped
to fund storefront mural projects by covering the costs of supplies and paying
each artist an honorarium. As part of the City’s Mural Support Program, the City
was able to provide paint and supplies to the local businesses and artists
spearheading this inspiring community initiative. To date, over 100 applicants
have been approved to receive a $400 voucher for paint and supplies to create a
public art piece during the pandemic;
12. Plywood and other hoarding materials are not restricted to temporary storefront
protection. Signs attached to temporary construction fences and temporary
covered construction walkways are called “Hoarding Signs.” The City of
Vancouver has a guide that summarizes the regulations and permitting process
for hoarding signs on private property (as a companion to but not as a substitute
for the Sign Bylaw);
13. As we’ve seen during COVID-19 with storefront hoarding murals, construction
hoarding offers a potential new “canvas” for the city’s artists and arts and culture
organizations to bring to life in terms of fostering a quality public realm that
contributes to engaging, active cultural experiences in our urban spaces;
14. Currently, under the City of Vancouver Sign By-Law (and in the City’s hoarding
signs guide), hoarding signs may list the names of consultants or contractors
working on the property, and may only be displayed while the project is being
constructed. Hoarding signs must not be illuminated;
15. A City of Vancouver permit is required for all large hoarding signs and the signs
are subject to size, height, and location criteria. The rules for large hoarding
signs are the same for all Sign By-law Districts across the city, with the exception
of residential properties along non-arterial streets. The allowed size of large
hoarding signs is determined by a property’s frontage. For each one metre of
frontage, one square metre of sign copy area is permitted. Properties in the
Residential Sign District along a non-arterial street are allowed 0.6 square metres
per frontage;
16. In 2014, the City of Toronto implemented a new public art initiative that requires
50 percent of the surface area of construction hoarding along public right of ways
be used for community art; the program has received positive pubic response
and supported a number of artists to gain exposure and share their work with
new audiences;

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, March 31, 2021 17
17. Toronto’s construction hoarding mural art program operates at no cost to the City
while enhancing the public realm and creating opportunities and support for local
artists and arts organizations. Developers and construction site owners in
Toronto commission local artists through a number of ways, including utilizing a
non-profit arts group such as STEPS to connect with artists or by engaging
directly with artists should they choose to do so; and
18. Given the high concentration of artists per capita in Vancouver and the multiple
barriers they face to participate in the Vancouver economy, notwithstanding the
additional hardships the arts and culture sector has experienced due to COVID-
19, a program that would facilitate the use of construction hoarding as a canvas
for Public Art could provide a significant and enduring source of income for many
artists and creatives living and working in Vancouver.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to explore and report back in
Q1 2022 on options for requiring the use of portions or a percentage of construction
hoarding on private property construction and development sites in Vancouver for
murals and public art, with the goal of making these spaces available to local artists and
arts and culture organizations to support recovery of the cultural sector and provide new
opportunities for artists to show their work, including recommendations for any by-law
changes to enable the permitted use of construction hoarding for public art;
FURTHER THAT recommendations and options aim to dovetail with the existing safety
or engineering (structural/sightline) requirements for such hoarding, aiming for ease of
administration within the existing hoarding requirements and permitting process;
FURTHER THAT staff consult with stakeholders as part of the exploration of options for
a hoarding mural program including but not limited to the city’s development and
construction sector, representatives from the visual arts community such as the
Vancouver Mural Festival, BIA’s and the City’s Public Art Committee.

9. Calling for a Plan to Clear Vancouver’s Permit and License Backlog and Revamp
this Critical City Service (Member’s Motion B.4)
The Committee heard from four speakers in support of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Dominato
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. Construction projects and any change of land use or occupancy on private
property require a building permit. All projects must comply with the Vancouver
Building By-law to meet life safety, livability, accessibility, and sustainability
requirements. In the case of large-scale projects, and/or where zoning
relaxations or particular types of land uses are proposed, a separate
development permit is required before a building permit application can be
submitted;
2. The layering of policy and regulations is a significant contributor to permit
processing delays. Over the course of many years, the City has endeavoured to
introduce various measures to decrease the length and complexity of
Vancouver’s permitting process such as online services, more efficient
procedures, a regulatory review, the ASAP pilot and programs such as the
Certified Professional (CP) Program;
3. Currently there is a significant backlog of building and development permit
applications. Based on data up to 2018, building and development permit
application volumes have gone up by 30 percent since 2007, and trades permit
volumes have gone up nearly 40 percent over the same span;
4. The 2018 and 2019 Civic Service Satisfaction Surveys found that building and
development services ranked near the bottom by both residents and businesses.
In 2018, more than 50% of businesses expressed dissatisfaction with
development and building permit services. And 78 percent of residents felt the
City should invest more in development and building permit service; 85 percent
of businesses said this was critical;
5. Vancouver is not unique in facing a permit application backlog. The cities of
Toronto and Markham in Ontario underwent extensive development process
reviews by KPMG in 2019. These reviews led to a series of recommendations
designed to help ensure that the development review process in these two cities
remains efficient, effective, and impactful as the volume, pace, and complexity of
development evolves;
6. In Metro Vancouver, permit application backlogs have also been experienced
over the past decade by municipalities large and small such as Surrey,
Coquitlam, White Rock, and Abbotsford. For example, a cyclical review in
Coquitlam made 21 recommendations that included organizational changes and
more customer service and proactive problem solving, in order to handle the
unprecedented high levels of permit and inspection activity in the city;

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, March 31, 2021 19
7. In response to public concerns, in 2019, City staff began laying out a plan to
simplify and reduce development processes, including speeding up permits,
leveraging technology to deliver services online and improving the overall
customer experience;
8. The current backlog situation represents a watershed moment for our city and
requires urgent attention. The Covid-19 pandemic has created a perfect storm
due to the volume and complexity of projects requiring permits, while at the same
time resulting in a dramatic shift in City staff working from home but without the
necessary, supporting technology infrastructure. Available staff resources are
currently fully allocated to processing permit applications from previous years.
Yet new applications continue to flood in and the situation has been further
exacerbated by an increased emphasis on new rental housing projects,
combined with a similar increase in demand and interest from homeowners
looking to improve make home improvements to better cope with pandemic
challenges;
9. In response to queries from Council and others, staff point to the need to
establish and implement new and better systems to clear the permitting backlog.
By focusing on the backlog of smaller-scale projects and clearing those
expeditiously, it would free up resources to concentrate on more complex larger-
scale housing projects that are also backlogged including urgently needed non-
profit, social and market rental housing;
10. Moving forward, separating permit processes into two streams – one that is
specific to smaller-scale development such as improvements to single family
homes, duplexes and smaller rental projects, condo improvements, laneway
houses and small-scale commercial projects, and a second stream for larger-
scale development - could support ongoing, quicker turnaround of permit
approvals;
11. The City’s permit application backlog is having serious financial and other
negative effects for applicants and City staff alike. For example, a recent study by
LOCO BC in partnership with the Downtown Vancouver Business Improvement
Association, the Building Owners and Managers Association of BC, and the
Vancouver BIA Partnership among others, found that the average wait time for
permits and licensing in Vancouver is 8.2 months. The average corresponding
economic loss per business permit or licence is estimated to be in excess of
$720,000. Delayed permits have contributed to an environment of instability and
uncertainty for businesses in addition to escalating costs;
12. On March 5, 2021, the Provincial Government began accepting applications for a
$15-million program to help local governments improve their development
approvals processes, such as upgrades to a digital or online development
application process or conducting internal reviews of current development
approvals processes to identify opportunities for improvement; and
13. Addressing the City’s permit backlog and investing in the technological and other
transformative changes will pay dividends not only in the short-term, but also the
long term to help meet the City’s housing goals and better serve residents and

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, March 31, 2021 20
businesses alike. It will also significantly strengthen post-pandemic economic
recovery.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to report back within 30 days with an action plan to
clear the City’s permit and license backlog by or before the end of Q3 2022;
FURTHER THAT the proposed action plan consider a range of options to
address the existing backlog, including but not limited to, streamlining and
simplifying regulations, expanding use of credentialed professionals to reduce
the need for a secondary review by staff, seconding other municipal employees
or retired employees, reallocating resources, and/or adopting new tools and
technology.
B. THAT Council direct staff to develop a medium term plan in 2021 that identifies
strategies for systemic changes with respect to the City’s development and
permit system, including but not limited to, organizational restructuring, new
technology adoption, client navigation support, defined service standards, and an
accountability and monitoring framework;
FURTHER THAT the plan include considerations for the 2022 budget, including
identifying the required multi-year technology investments necessary to improve
overall service delivery.
C. THAT staff identify and pursue funding opportunities to support this work, such
as the recently announced Provincial Government program to help local
governments improve their development services and approvals processes.
