SECONDED by Councillor Carr
WHEREAS
1. The purposes of the Province of British Columbia’s Freedom of Information and
Protection of Privacy Act are “to make public bodies more accountable to the
public and to protect personal privacy”, including “giving the public a right of
access to records.”;
2. The City of Vancouver is committed to an open and transparent government and
has strived conscientiously to develop a robust proactive information release
program to provide equal access to frequently requested City records for citizens
and the media alike in support of the City’s goal to foster public understanding of
City processes through openness and transparency;
3. At the Tuesday, May 3, 2016, Regular Council Meeting, Council unanimously
supported a motion submitted by Councillor Affleck calling on Vancouver City
Council to “demonstrate a commitment to openness and transparency by
directing that all expenses from the Mayor’s Office budget, including expenses
from the Mayor’s discretionary fund, and expenses from the corresponding office
budget for City Councillors, be released proactively to the public on a quarterly
basis through the City’s online Open Data Catalogue, including copies of all
contractor and supplier invoices (consistent with appropriate privacy protection
legislation), beginning with expenses for the current 2016 Budget year.”;
4. Consistent with Council’s direction and the City of Vancouver’s commitment to an
open and transparent government, the annual office budget for the Mayor and
the annual office budget for City Councillors, as well as their respective expenses
incurred while conducting business on behalf of the City, are proactively posted
on the City’s Open Data Catalogue and updated quarterly;
5. Beginning in 2016, and with monthly updates thereafter, the City of Vancouver
has taken steps to post all Freedom of Information responses online, with the
exception of those that contain personal, third party, or City confidential
information, including a notation of the original request for records in the
response letter;
