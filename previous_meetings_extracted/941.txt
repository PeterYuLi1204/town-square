On April 29, 2019, at the reconvened Regular Council meeting following the Standing

Regular Council meeting to be held on May 14, 2019, as Unfinished Business.
The motion below was on the floor.
MOVED by Councillor Hardwick
SECONDED by Councillor De Genova
WHEREAS
1. On January 30, 2019, Vancouver City Council endorsed a SkyTrain Millennium
Line extension from Arbutus Street to the University of British Columbia (UBC);
2. SkyTrain is TransLink's name for the Vancouver region's rail system which has
two main types of technology, the Canada Line that is conventional and the Expo
and Millennium Lines that are unconventional. The unconventional Millennium
Line technology would apply to the proposed extension to UBC, of which SNC
Lavalin (track and electrics) and Bombardier (cars) partnered to build the
SkyTrain Millennium Line;
3. On February 11, 2019, it was announced that Federal Ethics Commissioner
Mario Dion will investigate allegations that the Prime Minister's Office pressured
former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to help Quebec engineering firm
SNC-Lavalin avoid criminal prosecution;
4. Ongoing media reports since February 6, 2019, have exposed the current status
of corruption charges related to the SNC-Lavalin Group Inc., involving alleged
bribery and fraud. In the wake of a failed bid for judicial review, the appearance is
that Public Prosecution Service of Canada is likely to proceed with a trial rather
than a negotiated settlement agreement;
5. Bombardier is also reported as being investigated for allegations of corruption
through a World Bank audit and has been struggling to produce trains for existing
orders for rail equipment or to fix equipment problems. The New York City Transit
Authority announced as reported on January 24, 2019, that they are halting
delivery of any new train cars from Bombardier until more of the existing ones are
fixed;
6. City Council endorsement of Broadway rapid transit extension to UBC as
SkyTrain Millennium Line technology was rushed in consideration of potential
funding in the Federal budget announced March 19, 2019, that did not
materialize;
7. City of Vancouver statements of financial information show a total of $2,916,452
in payments to SNC-Lavalin between 2010 and 2017;

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, May 14, 2019 6
8. Part of the project approval process for the subway SkyTrain Millennium Line
extension is the consideration by the TransLink Mayors’ Council, which endorsed
SkyTrain at their meeting on February 15, 2019, subject to confirmation from staff
regarding the proprietary rights of SNC-Lavalin and the ability to get competitive
bids;
9. The recent 2019 McElhanney draft report, that both the City of Vancouver and
the TransLink Mayors’ Council based the decision to endorse SkyTrain
technology for a Millennium Line extension of the subway Arbutus to UBC, was
an update of the former 2012 report by SNC-Lavalin / Steer Davies Gleave report
that recommended the SkyTrain Millennium Line extension to Broadway;
10. A criminal conviction against SNC-Lavalin could result in them not being allowed
to bid on either the phase 1 Millennium Line extension Broadway subway from
VCC to Arbutus or the phase 2 extension from Arbutus to UBC;
11. Council requires all related information to make informed decisions.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council instruct staff to report back to Council with a thorough review of
the existing relationship between the City of Vancouver, SNC Lavalin, and
Bombardier, including the procurement relationship.
B. THAT Council instruct staff to report back to Council with information on how
SkyTrain use as a Millennium Line extension could be affected by further
outcomes of the criminal prosecution for corruption charges of SNC-Lavalin
Group Inc. and the World Bank's audit of Bombardier for allegations of
corruption.
C. THAT Council instruct staff to consult with TransLink staff and report back to
Council on the results as soon as available from the TransLink staff report to the
Mayors’ Council on any proprietary rights or bidding advantage of SNC-Lavalin
and Bombardier for the SkyTrain Millennium Line extension and the ability for
other firms to bid competitively.
D. THAT the above information be provided to Council, and before any further
Council decisions are made on a Broadway subway phase 1 or phase 2 for a
SkyTrain Millennium Line extension, Council should consider whether any
information required by this motion has not been presented to Council, and
whether any decision should be delayed until that information is fully reviewed
and confirmed to Council’s satisfaction.
Following discussion, Council agreed to separate the vote on the components of the motion.
The Motion was put with A CARRIED with Councillor Boyle and Mayor Stewart opposed
(Vote No. 04374), B CARRIED with Councillors Boyle, Carr, Fry and Mayor Stewart opposed
(Vote No. 04375), C CARRIED with Councillor Boyle opposed and Councillor Dominato

Dominato, Fry, Kirby-Yung, Swanson, Wiebe and Mayor Stewart opposed, and Councillor
De Genova abstaining from the vote (Vote No. 04377).
Section 145.1 of the Vancouver Charter states “Where a member present at a meeting abstains
from voting, they are deemed to have voted in the affirmative.”

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, May 14, 2019 9
The motion below was on the floor.
MOVED by Councillor Fry
SECONDED by Councillor Carr
WHEREAS
1. Currently, the Motor Vehicle Act (“MVA”) stipulates a speed limit of 50 kilometers
per hour (“km/h”) within city limits;
2. The probability of pedestrian survival is about 90% if struck by a motor vehicle
travelling at 30 km/h, while survival is reduced to 20% if struck by a motor vehicle
travelling at 50 km/h;
3. Lower speed limits are more compatible with active transportation, and create
safer, better engaged, healthier and more inclusive communities;
4. In 2012, the City of Vancouver’s Pedestrian Safety Study identified that mixed
mode roadways allow for shared use of space by motor vehicles, pedestrians,
and bicyclists without lane assignment. These roadways typically have posted
reduced speed limits, while improving public realm, social connectivity, and
increasing active transportation;
5. In 2015, the BC Road Safety Strategy set out the goal of zero traffic fatalities and
serious injuries and discussed safe speeds. In 2016, the Provincial Health
Officer’s Annual Report also recommended a 30 km/h speed limit in urban areas;
6. In 2016, the City of Vancouver launched its action plan “Moving Towards Zero”
which is linked to Vision Zero, an international framework and project that
prioritizes road traffic safety over speed or convenience and emphasizes that the
responsibility for safety is shared by transportation system designers and road
users;
7. In June 2016, as part of its position paper, Modernizing the BC Motor Vehicle
Act, the British Columbia-based Road Safety Law Reform Group recommended:
“A default provincial speed limit of 30 km/h for local (no centre line) streets
should be included in the Motor Vehicle Act, with municipalities enabled to
increase speed limits on local streets in a case-by-case basis by by-law and
posted signage.”;
8. In 2018, the provincial government’s B.C. Community Road Safety Toolkit
recommended lower speed limits in downtown areas and residential roads;
9. Today, Vancouver has a 30 km/h limit on designated bike routes, in school and
playground zones during posted times and on local streets. Additionally,
Vancouver has designated a portion of Hastings Street, 29th Avenue and Victoria
Drive with 30 km/h limit. However, a blanket speed limit reduction for local streets
would require changes to the Motor Vehicle Act or significant signage and
roadwork by the city;

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, May 14, 2019 10
10. Vancouver’s goal is Moving Towards Zero Fatalities and Serious Injuries.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to submit the following resolution along with the above
preamble (articles 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8) for consideration at the Lower Mainland Local

BC Municipalities lobby the province to amend the Motor Vehicle Act to a default
speed limit of 30 kilometers per hour for local streets with municipalities enabled
to increase speed limits on local streets in a case-by-case basis by by-laws and
posted signage.”
B. THAT Council direct staff to develop a pilot 30 kilometers per hour speed limit
demonstration project, focused on mixed mode use, reduced speeds, and
complimentary road design with a mechanism to record and analyze before and
after data.
C. THAT Council direct staff to identify a local street, area, or areas within the city to
pilot a 30 kilometer per hour speed limit demonstration project and report back
with implementation strategy, timing, and budget as well as proposed road
design changes by Q3 2019.

2. Supporting the Ban on Shark Fin Importation Act Bill S238
MOVED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
SECONDED by Councillor Wiebe
WHEREAS
1. On April 11, 2017, Senator Michael MacDonald introduced Bill S-238, "An Act to
amend the Fisheries Act and the Wild Animal and Plant Protection and
Regulation of International and Interprovincial Trade Act (importation of shark
fins)", also referred to as "The Ban on Shark Fin Importation Act". This Bill will
create a law that will prohibit the inhumane act of shark finning in Canada and
ban the importation of shark fins that have been harvested through shark finning;
2. The Canadian Government has banned "shark finning" in Canadian waters since
1994 as has the United States (2009) and the European Community (2003), but
the sale and importation of shark fins continues in cities across Canada and the
world;
3. In September, 2012, Vancouver City Council unanimously passed a motion
instructing staff to work directly with the cities of Richmond and Burnaby in order
to develop a common approach to ban the sale of shark fin in the three cities;
4. In April, 2017, Toronto City Council passed a motion expressing its support to the
Prime Minister and Government of Canada for Bill S238, The Ban on Shark Fin
Importation Act;
5. Shark finning is a wasteful, inhumane practice that involves cutting off a shark's
fins and then tossing the still-live shark back overboard to drown, bleed to death,
or be eaten alive by other animals. Each year, up to 73 million sharks are killed
primarily for their fins, threatening one-third of open ocean sharks with extinction;
6. A ban on the importation of shark fin would have a significant impact on the shark
fin industry in Canada and would reduce the demand for shark fin imports and
subsequently the practice of shark finning. Endorsing Bill S-238 will demonstrate
Council's commitment to protecting shark populations and help prevent the
extinction of shark species.

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, May 14, 2019 30
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council endorse Bill S238, The Ban on Shark
Fin Importation Act expressing its support for protecting shark populations and the role
they play in our marine ecosystems;
FURTHER THAT the Mayor, on behalf of Council, forward this motion to the Federation
of Canadian Municipalities asking them to encourage other municipalities to express
their support for Bill S-238.

(Councillor Hardwick absent for the vote)
3. Formalize the False Creek to the Fraser River Blueways
MOVED by Councillor Wiebe
SECONDED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
WHEREAS
1. A blueway is a network of bodies of water, either on the surface (like rivers,
creeks and lakes) or subsurface (aquifers). All blueways exist within a watershed
– an area of land that catches rain/snow and where water flows downward into a
specific river, stream, lake or acquifer. Blueways either exist in the present or
formerly existed in the past. Present day blueways can be managed from the
perspective of ecological preservation and stormwater management while former
blueways are treated by restoring or daylighting them. Existing blueways and
restored/daylighted blueways revive and protect ecosystems within our urban
communities to help cities deal with the impacts of climate change. They improve
water quality, absorb carbon and heavy rainfall, buffer floods, protect and expand
urban forests, and increase biodiversity and wildlife habitats. By incorporating
trails and bike paths, blueways can improve health and wellbeing, connect us to
each other, and provide active ways of moving around the region. Currently,
various creek networks exist within two watersheds: the China Creek Watershed
and the Brunette Watershed;
2. Much of the creek network runs alongside the existing Central Valley Greenway
and BC Parkway and is within close proximity to public transit at all points.
Connecting and formalizing this blueway would increase access to water for local
residents across three of BC’s largest communities. By advancing the use of
blueways in urban areas, the City of Vancouver can limit its biodiversity loss
while educating the public on the value and benefits of reconnecting habitats and
rehabilitating natural areas in order to allow species not only to survive, but
thrive;
3. Significant work has already been done to create the Central Valley Greenway
and BC Parkway through a collaborative effort by Translink, MetroVan, and the
cities of Vancouver, Burnaby, and New Westminster. Many environmental
stewardship groups have also kept the restoration of Still Creek and the Brunette

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, May 14, 2019 31
River as a high profile issue. This blueways transformation process will enhance,
restore and connect ecologically important systems along these paths;
4. In July 1988, Council endorsed Still Creek to be maintained as an open
watercourse, and committed to pursuing day-lighting, alongside a continuous
pedestrian/bicycle pathway linking Burnaby Lake to the B.C. Parkway at 29th
Avenue Station. In July 2000, Council established the Still Creek Greenway
Enhancement Fund. In July 2002, Council adopted the Grandview Boundary
Industrial Area Rezoning and Development Policies and Guidelines which
contain specific guidelines and a 10 and 50 year action plan to protect and
enhance Still Creek. In December 2006, Council endorsed the Integrated
Stormwater Management Plan (ISMP) for the Still Creek Watershed which
identifies private and public actions to improve stormwater management,
recreational opportunities, and creek health. In April 2008, Council authorized
that the annual income from the lease of 2500 Skeena Street be held in the Still
Creek Greenway Enhancement Fund for ongoing initiatives. Still Creek illustrates
successful collaboration on ecosystem restoration between the cities of
Vancouver and Burnaby in Metro Vancouver. Partnership, creative governance,
community engagement, and innovative funding approaches were all essential
components that helped the two cities come together to invest in ecosystem
health and restore Still Creek, one of only two daylit streams in the City of
Vancouver. After decades of pollution and neglect, this collaboration led to many
benefits, including the return of spawning salmon, yet there still remains a lot of
work to do;
5. Over the past 30 years, Burnaby and New Westminster have demonstrated
strong leadership in creek restoration, natural asset protection, and ecosystem
rehabilitation along this blueway. This intermunicipal work in the rehabilitation of
the creek helped chum salmon return to the Vancouver section of Still Creek in
2012 for the first time in nearly 80 years. With the renewal of the Burnaby Lake
lease there is an opportunity for Metro Vancouver to create a Regional Blueway
that supports this effort;
6. The majority of work that remains lies in daylighting China Creek in Vancouver,
expanding natural ecosystems and habitats along the entire blueway, and
connecting it to other Green spaces along the way. The first step is developing a
blueway transition plan to ensure the retention and protection of Vancouver’s
existing natural assets and real property along the route. The plan will aim to
daylight creeks, expand biodiversity, create amenities and public spaces, and
develop sub trails connecting it to other natural assets such as Trout Lake and
Renfrew Ravine. There are many opportunities for different stakeholders, cities,
regions, and nonprofits to join in a collaborative effort to realize a complete
Blueway from False Creek to the Fraser River;
7. China Creek is currently buried in the False Creek flats. False Creek Flats may
see significant redevelopment in the coming years under the False Creek Flats
Area Plan (approved by Council on May 17, 2017), which can be built around or
upon the daylighting of China Creek;

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, May 14, 2019 32
8. In 2019, Vancouver City Council passed a Watershed Revival Plan, directing
staff to report back with a scope of work to develop a comprehensive watershed
management plan that includes prioritized strategies, including new land
acquisition, protecting existing waterway and habitat connections, daylighting
streams, and intergovernmental coordination with local First Nations and
neighbouring municipalities;
9. The Vancouver Park Board’s Parks and Recreation Services Master Plan set 10
goals to shape the next 25 years of Vancouver’s parks and recreation. Goal 6 is
to “create a green network that will connect our parks, waterfront and recreation
areas” and includes a draft concept for an interconnected green network;
10. The Vancouver School Board approved the first ever Environmental
Sustainability Plan in 2019 to advance five key themes: sustainability in
education, green spaces, resource conservation and climate change,
sustainability transportation and leadership in sustainability. Multiple schools will
have connections to outdoor learning on the blueway, with Nootka Elementary
having the potential to enhance a portion of the creek on VSB land;
11. Metro Vancouver develops and manages municipal components of the Regional
Recreation Greenway Network, working with municipalities and First Nations to
identify where appropriate measures to protect, enhance and restore ecologically
important systems, features, corridors and establish buffers along watercourses,
coastlines, agricultural lands, and other ecologically important features;
12. The British Columbia Salmon Restoration and Innovation Fund, a contribution
program funded jointly by the federal and provincial government, will deliver up to
$142.85 million over 5 years to support BC’s fish and seafood sector, and to
ensure the restoration, protection and maintenance of healthy and diverse
salmon populations and their habitats;
13. Infrastructure Canada will deliver $3.917 Billion to municipalities through a
bilateral agreement with the Province of British Columbia under four funding
streams, including green infrastructure, over the next ten years;
14. The findings of a United Nations-backed report from the Intergovernmental
Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) were
approved by representatives of 132 governments in Paris in May 2019. The
report warns that nature is declining globally at rates unprecedented in human
history – and the rate of species extinctions is accelerating, with grave impacts
on people around the world. The report also tells us that it is not too late to make
a difference, but only if we start now at every level from local to global.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct City staff to develop a blueways
transformation plan from False Creek to the Fraser River through Trout and Burnaby
Lake and report back to Council in November 2019. The Plan is to:
1. Honour, respect and learn from the Musqueam, Squamish, Tsleil-Waututh and
Kwikwetlem First Nations traditional and contemporary relationship to the land

Minutes, May 14, 2019 33
and waterways and to explore opportunities to collaboratively plan for the future;
2. Align with current and developing City plans, policies and strategies, including
the Shore to Core work already underway and to include this plan as part of the
report back to Council in November 2019;
3. Clarify roles and responsibilities amongst the City of Vancouver, the Vancouver
Park Board and the Vancouver School Board, in the delivery of the blueways
from False Creek to Boundary Road;
4. Explore opportunities for collaborative planning with Metro Vancouver, the City of
Burnaby and the City of New Westminster on a regional strategy, and;
5. Outline appropriate resourcing and coordination of staff, including exploring the
establishment of a Blueways Enhancement Fund.

4. Considering Animal Welfare in Vancouver’s Procurement Policies
MOVED by Councillor Fry
SECONDED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
WHEREAS
1. Procurement of goods and services by the City of Vancouver are guided by the
Ethical Purchasing Policy (AF-014-01) and the Supplier Code of Conduct: these
policies ensure that purchases by the City are informed by values like ethics and
fair trade, fair wages and environmental impacts;
2. The City of Vancouver Procurement Policy, Ethical Purchasing Policy and
Supplier Code of Conduct are not currently or explicitly informed by animal
welfare, specifically but not limited to pest control, or animal related businesses;

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, May 14, 2019 34
3. The City of Vancouver purchases animal food products for hosted events can
source third-party certified products;
4. Animal welfare is the scientific assessment of an animal’s physical and mental
state in relation to its quality of life, including experiences in life and death;
5. The basic necessities to ensure the welfare of animals under human control are
legally enshrined and internationally recognized by the BC SPCA, Humane
Canada, the Canadian Medical Veterinary Association, and many other
professional groups as the Five Freedoms:
i. freedom from hunger, malnutrition and thirst;
ii. freedom from fear and distress;
iii. freedom from physical and thermal discomfort;
iv. freedom from pain, injury and disease; and
v. freedom to express normal patterns of behaviour;
6. Animal welfare accreditation and certification programs serve to further improve
animals’ quality of life in addition to the basic Five Freedoms. For example,
auditing animal-related businesses (e.g. pest control, dog training, boarding, etc.)
to ensure they follow a set of evidence-based standards, and use the kindest,
most humane methods. Many of these said animal-related business services are
accessed by the City of Vancouver, for building maintenance contracts and
animal control directives;
7. Animal welfare farm certification programs offer third-party certification for the
animal farming industry with assurance that the food products come from farms
with “higher welfare” standards in place;
8. Foods such as foie gras (fatty liver of force-fed ducks or geese) or shark fin
(slicing off a shark's fin and discarding the rest of the still-living animal to die) are
harvested in an inherently inhumane manner and inconsistent with animal
welfare practices;
9. In February 2019, the BC Ministry of Agriculture acknowledged the value of
animal welfare by adopting into legislation the NFACC codes of practice for the
care and handling of farm animals, which outline minimum care standards for
animals;
10. In 2013, Vancouver became the first city in Canada to embrace "Meatless
Monday," encouraging residents to forego meat for one day a week for the sake
of the planet and their health, including lighter environmental footprint, and
animal welfare.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council affirms a commitment to progressive animal welfare as part of any
ethical purchasing policies by the City of Vancouver.

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, May 14, 2019 35
B. THAT staff review the City of Vancouver’s Ethical Purchasing Policy and report
back to Council with recommendations on how to incorporate animal welfare
language into it.
C. THAT staff review the City of Vancouver’s Supplier Code of Conduct to ensure
that City suppliers and their sub-contractors will operate, where applicable, within
recognized animal welfare accreditation standards, specifically but not limited to
pest control, or animal related businesses.

5. Dealing with Doggie Doo Doo in Support of Vancouver's Zero Waste Goals and
Cleaner Parks and Streets
MOVED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
SECONDED by Councillor Wiebe
WHEREAS
1. The City of Vancouver is currently undertaking a dog waste collection pilot
project that started in 2016 and involves six city parks. Red dog waste collection
carts have been located at Charleson Park, Coopers Park, Grimmett Park, John
Hendry (Trout Lake) Park and Hinge Park. Only minor expansion is currently
contemplated for a further one to two parks in the coming year;
2. The goal of the dog waste pilot is to increase diversion of dog waste away from
the landfill. Dog waste at the landfill creates methane, a powerful greenhouse
gas;
3. The dog waste pilot program aligns with the City’s Zero Waste goal;
4. By providing dog owners with a convenient disposal option, the collection pilot is
also intended to support cleaner parks, green spaces, and streets. Keeping dog
waste off the ground is important as people walk on paths and parks and no one

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, May 14, 2019 36
wants to step or slip in dog waste. Dog waste is also smelly and poses health
risks if not cleaned up and disposed of property. Plus dog waste is not a fertilizer,
and does not disappear in the rain;
5. When red dog waste carts or bins are not available in public spaces, people’s
only disposal option is to place dog waste bags in general litter bins, which
means contributing to the landfill. Disposal for residents involves bagging the
waste before placing in a designated cart or in the garbage;
6. This motion aligns with recommendation 2.10 of the People, Parks and Dogs
Strategy, to “Expand the separated dog waste program and promote initiatives to
effectively manage dog waste”. During the public engagement process,
Vancouver residents were very supportive of more separated waste bins to
address both odor issues and broader sustainability benefits;
7. In addition to the cost of bins, the City’s processing of dog waste involves
collection and manually separating waste from the bags. Bags are disposed as
garbage, and dog waste is taken to the waste water treatment plant;
8. Metro Vancouver estimates that over 350,000 dogs produce dog waste each
day;
9. Vancouver’s urban dog population is growing. 2016 data from the City of
Vancouver Animal Services group shows a steady increase in the number of
licensed dogs over the last 12 years, with 21,332 licensed dogs. However the
actual estimated dog population in Vancouver is between 32,390 and 55,947;
10. Currently there is only one vendor providing dog waste services across several
municipalities;
11. For resident dog owners disposing privately, dog waste can be flushed in toilets
and treated at a wastewater treatment plant with other sewage. Waste needs to
be removed from bags; it cannot be flushed in them as they will clog plumbing
and sewers. It should not be put in storm sewers on streets as these carry rain to
natural creeks. Other private disposal options include using a collection service
or building a composter.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to report back on costs, and barriers to expanding dog
waste collection services throughout the City, as well as possible options to
address any identified barriers.
B. THAT the report back be provided to Council in time to enable consideration of
the inclusion of expanded collection and waste management services in the 2020
operating budget.
C. THAT staff consult and engage with Metro Vancouver staff to identify available
waste management services and the opportunity for shared services.
