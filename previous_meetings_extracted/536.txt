2. Local Elected Representation on the TransLink Board
MOVED by Councillor Fry
SECONDED by Councillor Swanson
WHEREAS
1. The City of Vancouver had elected Councillors appointed to the TransLink Board
until 2008;
2. There are currently two Metro Vancouver mayors and nine unelected members
on the TransLink Board;
3. The City of Vancouver Council represents the municipal population with the
highest transit use in the region; with 50% of transit riders;
4. The provision of greatly improved public transit is part of one of the City of
Vancouver’s major Big Moves to address the climate crisis;
5. Representation from the City of Vancouver and other cities within Metro
Vancouver on the TransLink Board would open the door for more local initiatives
to increase accessibility and affordability of transit for our communities, which
would make it easier to meet our climate goals;
6. The Metro Vancouver Mayors’ Council on Regional Transportation has
consistently and including during the 2020 British Columbia general election,
urged the provincial government to move ahead with a promised review of
TransLink’s governance structure, where a majority of people around the table
are elected by the people; and
7. The City of Vancouver’s Transportation Advisory Committee and Seniors
Advisory Committee have both supported this motion.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council request the Mayor to write to the BC
Government and urge them to reconfigure the Board of TransLink to allow for a majority
of the Board to be composed of local elected officials, and that these positions are
allocated in relation to the populations, ridership, and transit infrastructure present and
potential of member cities with consideration of urban, suburban, and rural
representation.

3. Supporting the Legal Challenge Against Discrimination Implied in Quebec’s Bill 21
At 10:35 am, Councillor Dominato rose on a point of order under Sections 8.7(d) and 8.7(f) of
the Procedure By-law, enquiring whether the above-noted motion is in order as a similar motion
had been approved by Council in 2019 and whether this grant can be funded out of the City’s
reserve fund as that reserve is to be used for potential future events in the City, such as the
pandemic.
* * * * *
Council recessed at 10:35 am and reconvened at 10:42 am.

After consulting with staff, Deputy Mayor Hardwick ruled Councillor Swanson’s motion in order
as recommendation A is not redundant as it is not reflective of the original motion, and
recommendation B, using the reserve fund, is at the discretion of Council.
MOVED by Councillor Swanson
SECONDED by Councillor Boyle
WHEREAS
1. In 2019 Vancouver City Council passed the following motion:
“THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Vancouver City Council continues to
support diversity, equity, and access for all citizens and support in principle the
legal challenge against the discrimination of freedom of religion as set out in
Quebec's Bill 21;
FURTHER THAT Council refer this motion to the Racial and Ethno-Cultural
Equity Advisory Committee for further consideration;”
2. The Racial and Ethno-Cultural Equity Advisory Committee (RECE) considered
the motion and a request for the City to help finance a legal challenge to
Quebec’s Bill 21 on January 13, 2022;
3. The legal challenge is currently in the appeal process at the Quebec Court of
Appeal, and then if there is no resolution, it will be escalated to the Supreme
Court of Canada;

Council Meeting
Minutes, February 8, 2022 21
4. The legal challenge is being led by the World Sikh Organization of Canada,
National Council of Canadian Muslims, and the Canadian Civil Liberties
Association (https://ccla.org/major-cases-and-reports/bill-21/);
5. The Racial and Ethno-Cultural Equity Advisory Committee (RECE) noted the
growing list of incidents of Islamophobia, not just in Quebec, but also in BC;
6. The Racial and Ethno-Cultural Equity Advisory Committee (RECE) noted that Bill
21 is not in line with Canadian values and highlights the continued inequality of
racialized people and incites racism;
7. The Racial and Ethno-Cultural Equity Advisory Committee (RECE) is also
concerned about the potential negative ripple effects of Bill 21 including a further
increase in Islamophobic hate incidents;
8. A number of Canadian cities, including Brampton ($100,000), Toronto ($100,000)
and Victoria ($9,500) have made financial contributions to support the upcoming
Supreme Court case;
9. The Racial and Ethno-Cultural Equity Advisory Committee (RECE) passed a
motion calling on Vancouver Council to contribute a minimum of $100,000 to
support the court case, similar to Brampton which has a smaller population than
Vancouver;
10. Vancouver City Council believes we cannot allow the defense of the Charter and
the foundational value of religious freedom to be on the backs of racialized
communities against the Province of Quebec with unlimited legal resources;
11. If Canadian cities assist to fund the legal challenge we level the playing field
since it is not a fair legal fight in the absence of federal government involvement;
12. A Supreme Court decision allowing infringement of religious freedom would have
negative consequences for Vancouver residents and all Canadians; and
13. Contributing money to the court case would be a concrete way of showing
solidarity with Muslims, Sikhs, and others disproportionately affected by Bill 21 in
BC and across Canada, and will show that Vancouver is willing to act as well as
talk about opposing discrimination against racialized people.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Vancouver City Council request the Mayor to make public Council’s
support for the Supreme Court case against Quebec’s Bill 21 launched by the
World Sikh Organization of Canada, National Council of Canadian Muslims, and
Canadian Civil Liberties Association.
B. THAT Vancouver City Council contribute a grant of $10,000 to this cause with the
money to come out of the City’s reserve fund.

4. Aligning Vancouver’s 2023-2026 Capital Plan with Increased Climate Emergency
Action
MOVED by Councillor Carr
SECONDED by Councillor Boyle
WHEREAS
1. The City of Vancouver develops 4-year capital plans aligned with the 4-year
election cycle and approval of the capital plan by public vote at the time of a civic
election, the next one to be held October 15, 2022;
2. Developing and implementing the City’s capital plan is typically an eight-year
process: two years to prepare the plan, four years to implement it and two follow-
up years to complete construction and wrap up projects. This means that the
2023-2026 capital plan, with projects wrapped up by 2028, must be sufficiently
robust to ensure we achieve our city’s Climate Emergency Action Plan (CEAP)
goals to reduce Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions by 50% by 2030. Because
Vancouver has only reduced emissions by 15% to date, the 2023-2026 capital
plan should aim to reduce our emissions by close to 35%;
3. Climate scientists are urging governments at all levels to more rapidly reduce
GHGs to prevent runaway global warming. If we do not reduce GHGs by at least
50% by 2030 and to net zero carbon by 2050 they predict that climate events
such as last summer’s “heat dome” that resulted in the deaths of 595 British
Columbians, 99 of which were Vancouverites, last fall’s “atmospheric river” that
caused extensive flooding, landslides and severe damage to transportation
infrastructure, the unprecedented tornado in Pacific Spirit Park, and the stronger
winds coupled with a higher king tide due to rising sea levels seriously damaged
Vancouver’s seawall this January, will become more common and more severe
in the future.
4. Youth, such as Greta Thunberg on a global level, and the Sustainabiliteens in
Vancouver, are calling for political leadership on climate change mitigation
stating their future is at stake. Leadership is needed at all levels of government.
Leadership both inspires and generates more leadership;

Council Meeting
Minutes, February 8, 2022 23
5. On November 3, 2021, staff delivered their first CEAP update to Council stating:
“the next capital plan is a significant opportunity to consider CEAP funding”;
6. As part of Vancouver 2022 Operating Budget passed on
December 7, 2021, Council created an annual $9 million fund dedicated to new
climate emergency action specifically directing that the 2022 funding be spent on
measures that will undoubtedly require additional capital spending;
7. Investing more in reducing GHGs now will reduce the greater future costs of
adapting to climate-caused changes including more extreme temperatures and
rising sea levels, and repairing climate-caused damages to our natural and built
environments;
8. Staff’s November 3, 2021, Report to Council on CEAP noted surveys showing
that 90% of Vancouver residents are concerned about climate but only 10%
understand the type and scale of action needed, including that the city must use
all tools: regulation, advocacy and investment, and increase accountability by
tracking milestones, outcomes and expenditures; and
9. City staff also noted in the November 3, 2021, CEAP Report that there are
considerable co-benefits to investments in climate action, including better health,
more green space, more equitable and lower cost transportation and an
estimation that an overall investment of $1.3B in CEAP measures will generate
$2.2B in savings including $1B in savings for Vancouver’s residents and
businesses over the next decade alone.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to:
1. Report back for Council’s consideration early in the 2023-2027 capital
budget planning process a list of potential capital projects, with
associated costs, benefits and estimated GHG reductions, to:
i. Achieve the necessary reductions in our city’s GHG emissions to
reach, at minimum, our stated goal of 50% reductions in GHG
emissions below 2007 levels by 2030 and that would significantly
move us to being a net zero carbon city by 2050;
ii. Simultaneously achieve equity and resilience objectives, including
energy retrofits of city and non-profit owned social and non-market
rental housing and childcare facilities, increasing the tree canopy
city-wide, and increasing renewable energy production including
solar hot water and solar voltaic as a resilience measure;
2. Ensure the needed capital funding is in place in the 2022-2026 capital
plan to complete new climate emergency projects funded through the
city’s annual $9 million climate levy including those noted in the city’s
2022 Operating Budget:

Council Meeting
Minutes, February 8, 2022 24
i. Electric vehicle infrastructure including EV chargers, power drops
for community events, chargers in rental buildings and charging
infrastructure for the city’s fleet and equipment;
ii. Transportation measures including transit, slow streets, and
walking and cycling improvements including to Vancouver
schools;
iii. Building retrofits for Vancouver civic facilities including community
centers and libraries to reduce GHGs and provide safe centers
during extreme weather events;
3. Establish a regular reporting schedule to Council and the public on the
costs and benefits of the funded projects and their contribution to meeting
our city’s climate emergency goals including emission reductions,
increased resiliency and social and economic benefits; and
4. Continue to seek partnership funding from senior governments and other
sources to help finance and more quickly implement climate emergency
projects.
B. THAT Council direct the Mayor to write letters on behalf of Council to the BC
Urban Mayors Caucus (BCUMC), Union of BC Municipalities (UBCM) and
Federation of Canadian Municipalities (FCM) to advocate for predictable funding
to enable achieving the Paris Accord targets of reducing GHGs by 50% by 2030
and net zero carbon by 2050, and cost-sharing arrangements with senior levels
of government to help fund and more quickly implement climate emergency
projects.

5. Improving the Effectiveness of Standards of Maintenance By-law
MOVED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
SECONDED by Councillor Swanson
WHEREAS

Council Meeting
Minutes, February 8, 2022 25
1. The City of Vancouver had a Standards of Maintenance By-law
No. 5462 (“the By-law”) which prescribes standards for the maintenance and
occupancy of buildings within the City of Vancouver to ensure that the buildings
are free from hazard and are maintained continuously in conformity with
accepted health, fire, and building requirements;
2. Section 23.6 (1) of the By-law states that “Every person who commits an offence
against this By-law is liable to a fine and penalty of not less than $250.00 or more
than $10,000.00 for each offence.”;
3. Section 23.6 (2) of the By-law states that “Despite the minimum fine referred to in
subsection (1), every person who commits an offence against section 11.1(1),
15.1(1), 16.1(2), 17, 18, 21.4(a), 21.13(a), 21.13(b), 21.14, or 23.3 is liable to a
fine of not less than $500.00 for each offence.” A significant number of the
specific offences noted under Section 23.6 (2) of the By-law relate to the
requirement to provide heat and hot water to the tenants of a building as well as
related fire prevention measures;
4. Section 23.7 of the By-law states that “Every person who commits an offence of
a continuing nature against this Bylaw is liable to a fine not less than $250.00
and not more than $10,000.00 for each day such offence continues.”;
5. Section 23.5 (1) of the By-law states that “Every person is guilty of an offence
against this By-law” wherever and whenever they violate the provisions of the By-
law, suffer or permit any act or thing to be done in contravention or violation of
the By-law, or neglect or refrain from doing those things required by the By-law
along with various related provisions of this section;
6. Section 23.5 (2) of the By-law states that “Each day that a violation is permitted
to exist, shall constitute a separate offence.”;
7. Section 23.8 of the By-law states that “Notwithstanding any other provisions of
this By-law, where any building or land does not comply with standards set out in
this By-law, the Council may, by resolution, order that failure to remedy any
default specified in such order within 60 days after service of such order, will
result in the work being carried out by the City at the expense of the owner.”;
8. In December 2020, the City of Vancouver reached a settlement with the owners
of the Balmoral and Regent hotels to expropriate the properties. The settlement
which was approved by Vancouver City Council, ensured that the buildings –
(after many years of enforcement and legal action “against the owners, who
oversaw decades of underinvestment and unaddressed life-safety issues that
resulted in the closure of these two derelict buildings in 2017 and 2019”) – could
be turned into safe and secure low-income housing in partnership with BC
Housing;
9. At the September 22, 2021, Standing Committee of Council on Policy and
Strategic Priorities, Council unanimously endorsed a staff recommendation to
commence legal action in relation to the Regal Hotel located at 1046 Granville

Council Meeting
Minutes, February 8, 2022 26
Street in order to bring this property into compliance with City By-laws and
address an unsafe condition identified by the City Building Inspector; and
10. Over the recent Christmas holidays in December of this year, residents of the
Regal Hotel were widely reported to be without heat for multiple days, at a time
when the outside temperature and wind chill factor were expected to drop to
minus 20 degrees. Living without heat during these incredibly cold temperatures
clearly represented a life-threatening situation for the residents of the building as
well as a significant violation of the City’s Standards of Maintenance By-law No.
5462 and its intent to safeguard and ensure the necessities of life for all
Vancouver residents.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to report back with
recommendations and options to improve the effectiveness of the Standards of
Maintenance By-law No. 5462 before the end of Q2, 2022 with respect to problematic
properties that exhibit a history of non-compliance, such as – but not restricted to –
giving consideration to raising the minimum and maximum fines for certain violations
where an immediate impact on the life and limb of building residents (such as non-
functioning heating systems) is clearly evident, as well as shortening the period of time
in which the City can step in to carry out any and all necessary work to bring a building
into compliance under the By-law at the expense of the property owner.

FURTHER THAT staff include in this report an analysis of the impact of these
measures on building closures and tenant evictions;
FURTHER THAT staff report back on the possibilities of requiring SRO owners to
place permanent plaques in their lobbies that would state the mailing address for
service of documents to landlords, how to call 311 with repair and maintenance
issues, contact info and function of the Residential Tenancy Branch;

temperature during cold snaps, that we also require buildings be able to not
exceed a maximum temperature during future heat waves;
AND FURTHER THAT considerations around options for adding building cooling
requirements within the Standards of Maintenance By-law No. 5462 be aligned

fine of not less than $500.00 for each offence.” A significant number of the
specific offences noted under Section 23.6 (2) of the By-law relate to the
requirement to provide heat and hot water to the tenants of a building as well as
related fire prevention measures;
4. Section 23.7 of the By-law states that “Every person who commits an offence of
a continuing nature against this Bylaw is liable to a fine not less than $250.00
and not more than $10,000.00 for each day such offence continues.”;
5. Section 23.5 (1) of the By-law states that “Every person is guilty of an offence
against this By-law” wherever and whenever they violate the provisions of the By-
law, suffer or permit any act or thing to be done in contravention or violation of
the By-law, or neglect or refrain from doing those things required by the By-law
along with various related provisions of this section;

Council Meeting
Minutes, February 8, 2022 28
6. Section 23.5 (2) of the By-law states that “Each day that a violation is permitted
to exist, shall constitute a separate offence.”;
7. Section 23.8 of the By-law states that “Notwithstanding any other provisions of
this By-law, where any building or land does not comply with standards set out in
this By-law, the Council may, by resolution, order that failure to remedy any
default specified in such order within 60 days after service of such order, will
result in the work being carried out by the City at the expense of the owner.”;
8. In December 2020, the City of Vancouver reached a settlement with the owners
of the Balmoral and Regent hotels to expropriate the properties. The settlement
which was approved by Vancouver City Council, ensured that the buildings –
(after many years of enforcement and legal action “against the owners, who
oversaw decades of underinvestment and unaddressed life-safety issues that
resulted in the closure of these two derelict buildings in 2017 and 2019”) – could
be turned into safe and secure low-income housing in partnership with BC
Housing;
9. At the September 22, 2021, Standing Committee of Council on Policy and
Strategic Priorities, Council unanimously endorsed a staff recommendation to
commence legal action in relation to the Regal Hotel located at 1046 Granville
Street in order to bring this property into compliance with City By-laws and
address an unsafe condition identified by the City Building Inspector; and
10. Over the recent Christmas holidays in December of this year, residents of the
Regal Hotel were widely reported to be without heat for multiple days, at a time
when the outside temperature and wind chill factor were expected to drop to
minus 20 degrees. Living without heat during these incredibly cold temperatures
clearly represented a life-threatening situation for the residents of the building as
well as a significant violation of the City’s Standards of Maintenance By-law No.
5462 and its intent to safeguard and ensure the necessities of life for all
Vancouver residents.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to report back with
recommendations and options to improve the effectiveness of the Standards of
Maintenance By-law No. 5462 before the end of Q2, 2022 with respect to problematic
properties that exhibit a history of non-compliance, such as – but not restricted to –
giving consideration to raising the minimum and maximum fines for certain violations
where an immediate impact on the life and limb of building residents (such as non-
functioning heating systems) is clearly evident, as well as shortening the period of time
in which the City can step in to carry out any and all necessary work to bring a building
into compliance under the By-law at the expense of the property owner;
FURTHER THAT staff include in this report an analysis of the impact of these measures
on building closures and tenant evictions;
FURTHER THAT staff report back on the possibilities of requiring Single Room
Occupancy (SRO) owners to place permanent plaques in their lobbies that would state
the mailing address for service of documents to landlords, how to call 311 with repair
and maintenance issues, contact info and function of the Residential Tenancy Branch;

Council Meeting
Minutes, February 8, 2022 29
FURTHER THAT staff report back on the possibility of requiring City inspectors to
contact tenants after they have made inspections so the tenant knows the result of their
complaints;
FURTHER THAT Council direct staff to report back with considerations for adding
language related to cooling within the Standards of Maintenance By-law No. 5462, so
that in addition to requiring buildings be able to maintain a minimum temperature during
cold snaps, that we also require buildings be able to not exceed a maximum temperature
during future heat waves;
AND FURTHER THAT considerations around options for adding building cooling
requirements within the Standards of Maintenance By-law No. 5462 be aligned with
action on zero emission buildings within Vancouver’s Climate Emergency Action Plan.

ENQUIRIES AND OTHER MATTERS
1. Status of Green Bin Collection Services
Councillor Kirby-Yung asked staff to comment on the status of green bin collection. The City
Manager noted that due to staff shortages because of surging Covid cases, the City switched to
bi-weekly green waste collection instead of weekly; however, the team is largely caught up and
is aiming to be back to normal collection services by March. Councillor Kirby-Yung enquired if it
was possible to resume weekly collections prior to March, as residents have noted sanitation
concerns, such as rodents. The City Manager noted that the Engineering Services management
team is monitoring the issue, and if it is possible to proceed earlier, staff will. Councillor Kirby-
Yung also asked if other cities are experiencing similar delays. The City Manager noted that no
specific data from other municipalities has been collected, as many contract out these services;
however, the City Manager agreed to reach out to other municipalities to collect this data and
share the results with Council.
2. FortisBC Application to the BC Utilities Commission
Councillor Carr noted FortisBC’s recent application to the BC Utilities Commission to connect
new residential dwellings with 100% renewable gas. Councillor Carr also noted that this
application has the potential to undermine the City’s goals, which are to move towards having all
new buildings to provide area and hot water heating by sources other than fossil fuels, and
asked if staff have considered an intervener status on this application. The City Manager
confirmed that staff are aware of this application and have applied for intervener status in this
proceeding and are working with Metro and other municipalities in this regard.

3. South False Creek Community and Planning Staff Engagement
Councillor Fry noted that together with Councillor Hardwick, as the appointed Council Liaisons
to the South False Creek, have been meeting with the community and the South False Creek
Neighbourhood Association, and highlighted the community’s eagerness to work with City
Planning staff in setting up the baseline and expectations for the area’s planning process, such
as, clarifying data and timelines, optimizing the contribution of the existing affordable housing on
site and providing support for the emergent priorities starting with the campus of care. Councillor
Fry asked staff what the proposed timeline is for staff engagement, keeping with the Council
policy of it being an open and transparent process, and whether he and Councillor Hardwick can
help facilitate that. The City Manager noted that the Director of Planning is drafting the terms of
reference for the planning process for South False Creek, and that this report will come to
Council seeking approval. The City Manager said he would follow up with staff on the timeline of
the report. Councillor Fry also asked if the report will include the report back with
recommendations to inform the formal scope of the Council Liaisons’ independent of the
planning process for False Creek South, and the City Manager confirmed that it would.
4. Updates on the Zoning and Development By-law for Home-Based Businesses
Councillor Dominato asked staff for an update on the zoning and development by-law around
home-based businesses on the ability to have clients come to their home business, as currently,
the by-law prohibits this and staff had indicated they were likely bringing back recommendations
in 2022. The City Manager agreed to follow up with staff and provide an update.
