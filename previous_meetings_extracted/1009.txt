NEW BUSINESS
1. Local Mountain Names for City Hall Meeting Rooms
MOVED by Mayor Robertson
SECONDED by Councillor Ball
WHEREAS
1. Meeting rooms on the third floor of City Hall have a hodgepodge of unofficial
names that have never had Council input or approval, nor do they acknowledge
City or First Nations landmarks, citizens or historical events, as most official City
names do;
2. Examples of this include: “Committee Room 1” is used for many different
functions beyond committee meetings and there are no other Committee Rooms
with numbers, the "Mayor's Ceremonial Board Room" and “Protocol Board
Room” assumed these placeholder names after renovations in 2011, and the
other two meeting rooms have never been given official names at all;
3. Rather than expecting the Council that will be sworn in on November 5, 2018, of
whom nine of 11 members are newly elected, to debate names for meeting
rooms in the near term, or conduct an extensive naming process while confusing
names persist, the outgoing Council can bestow coherent local landmark names.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT the five meeting rooms on the third floor of City Hall be given official
names that represent local west coast mountains, based on the mountains they
face.
B. THAT “Committee Room 1” be renamed to the “Cascadia Room”.

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, October 30, 2018 12
C. THAT the “Mayor’s Office Meeting Room” be re-named to the “Cypress Room”.
D. THAT the "Mayor's Ceremonial Board Room" be re-named to the "Two Sisters
Room", acknowledging the English translation of the Squamish First Nation name
for the mountains also known as “The Lions”.
E. THAT the “Protocol Board Room” be re-named to the “Grouse Room”.
F. THAT the “Councillors Meeting Room” be re-named the “Little Mountain Room”.
CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY (Vote No. 03411)
ENQUIRIES AND OTHER MATTERS
1. 2018 Local General Election
Councillor Affleck requested the status on two motions from the September 19, 2018, Regular
Council meeting following the Standing Committee on City Finance and Services meeting. The
first regarding a request to the Province to increase funding to help raise public awareness of
2018 local government elections in British Columbia and the second regarding the retention
period for physical election ballots.
The City Manager provided an update regarding the letter sent to the Province and also advised
that a report regarding the local general election results for 2018 is forthcoming.
2. Referred Members Motions
Councillor De Genova requested a list of members motions that have been referred and still
require follow up be provided to the next Council. The City Manager agreed to compile a list of
Council requests to be shared with the next Council.
3. Code of Conduct
Councillor De Genova noted the need for a harassment policy for Councillors as the current
process under the Code of Conduct is a long and drawn out process. The City Manager advised
that staff recommends a review with the next Council regarding the Code of Conduct as applied
to Councillors as the current Code of Conduct lacks clarity and requires a more expeditious
resolution process.
4. Recognition of Council Members
Following a video presentation on the accomplishments of Council over the last four years,
Mayor Robertson presented gifts to Councillors Affleck, Ball, Bremner, Deal, Jang, Louie,
Reimer and Stevenson, recognizing their contributions to the city of Vancouver during their
