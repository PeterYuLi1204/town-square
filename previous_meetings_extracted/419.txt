Minutes, January 17, 2023 33
2. Increasing the Climate-Smart Supply of Renewable Energy in Vancouver
MOVED by Councillor Carr
SECONDED by Councillor Boyle
WHEREAS
1. Vancouver, like cities and countries around the world, is facing an Increasing
numbers of record-breaking extreme weather events, including heat waves,
droughts, floods and storms. Extreme weather is evidence of Earth's rapidly
changing climate, which is detailed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC) (see https://www.ipcc.ch/report/sixth-assessment-report-working-
group-3/ and
https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg2/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGII_Summar
yForPolicymakers.pdf );
2. Accelerating climate change is putting people, infrastructure, economies and
natural ecosystems at increasing risk as evidenced by the death of 99
Vancouverites in the 2021 "heat dome", storm damage to Vancouver's sea wall
and Kitsilano pool, disruptions to supply chains, and loss of trees; (see
https://vancouversun.com/news/local-news/stanley-parks-trees-pushed-to-the-
brink-by-drought-moths ;
3. Climate change is also increasing the burden of costs for municipal governments.
According to the Federation of Canadian Municipalities (FCM), local
governments own and are responsible for about 60% of public infrastructure. A
2020 report by the FCM and the Insurance Bureau of Canada, noted that climate
adaptation is estimated to cost municipalities $5. 3 billion annually. (see
https://fcm.ca/en/news-media/news-release/climate-adaptation-estimated-cost-
municipalities-5-billion-
annually#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20report's%20findings,to%200.26%2
5%20of%20Canada's%20GDP ). In a report released November 30, 2022, the
total economic costs of the extreme weather events that BC experienced in 2021
are between $10.6 and $17.1 billion (see: A Climate Reckoning | Canadian
Centre for Policy Alternatives ;
4. Scientists are imploring every political jurisdiction to ramp up its efforts to reduce
its GHGs, rapidly reduce the use of fossil fuels and increase renewable energy
(see: UN climate report: It's 'now or never' to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees
https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/04/1115452 and
https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/powering-safer-future and
https://news.un.org/en/story/2022/05/1118452 ;
5. Although the City of Vancouver is committed to reducing by 50% its GHG
emissions over 2007 levels by 2030 and achieving net zero emissions by 2050 -
-commitments that are in line with globally-agreed-to targets negotiated by the
UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties -- we have only reduced our
emissions by 15 percent to date (see: https://vancouver.ca/files/cov/2021-ceap-
annual-report.pdf );

Council Meeting
Minutes, January 17, 2023 34
6. In Vancouver, 57 percent of our emissions come from burning gas in buildings
and 37 percent from transportation. The uptake in Vancouver is high for the
purchase of Zero Emission Vehicles (ZEVs): 12% of 2020-2021 vehicles sold. By
2030 all new construction will be net zero emission. The city's Climate
Emergency Action Plan also will require all current buildings to be retrofit to net
zero emission by 2050. Vancouver is able to be a leader in climate-smart
buildings due to our own building code as well as our investment in the training of
contractors and tradespeople through the Vancouver-initiated Zero Emissions
Building Exchange (ZEBX) and Metro Vancouver Zero Emissions Innovation
Center. In addition, the city accelerated uptake in installation of heat pumps by
offering matching grants to the provincial rebates for heat pumps;
7. Both EVs and building retrofits, including the installation of heat pumps, EV
charging and electric hot water heating, are creating increased demand for
electricity supply. However, B.C. Hydro's Five-Year Electrification Plan, released
by the government in September of 2021, estimates that it has sufficient supply
of clean electricity, including from Site C dam, only to 2030;
8. Motions submitted by the City of Vancouver for consideration by the Union of BC
Municipalities (UBCM) related to pursuing distributed renewable energy were
passed by consensus or near-consensus at UBCM's September 2022
Convention, specifically:
a. That the Government of B.C. pursue as quickly as possible adding
financial incentives, including increased feed-in-tariffs, for home and
building owners to install solar photovoltaic panels and solar-hot-water
systems, and modify the B.C. Building Code, and include in a future BC.
Existing Buildings Alterations Code specifications including design and
placement standards, and load-bearing requirements for solar
(photovoltaic) panels and solar hot water systems.
b. That the Government of British Columbia support and provide funding for
training programs for workers deep energy retrofits and construction of
deeply affordable climate-smart housing, including installing solar panels,
solar hot water systems and heat pumps;
9. Recognizing the need to quickly shift to renewable energy, other jurisdictions are
requiring solar energy production. For example, starting in 2023 Berlin is
requiring solar panel (PV) installations for all new buildings and major
renovations. Copenhagen, due to its district energy system and green electricity
grid which is largely powered by wind energy, is aiming to be net carbon neutral
by 2025. Also, 802 cities in Europe have re-purchased private utility companies
to green their grids and keep consumer costs low. And in November, 2022,
France announced that it will require all parking lots with 80 or more spaces to be
covered by solar panels. See: https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/03/parking-lots-
becoming-as-important-as-cars-in-climate-change-efforts.html# ;
10. If installed properly, rooftop solar applications are synergistic with greens roofs,
which are currently required in Vancouver on large commercial and institutional

Council Meeting
Minutes, January 17, 2023 35
buildings but may in future be required on other buildings types as part of
Vancouver’s Rain City Strategy and Climate Emergency Action Plan. See Photo
Voltaic on Green Roofs – the Scandinavian Way (livingarchitecturemonitor.com);
11. Solar photovoltaic systems would not only help meet the increasing demand for
renewable electricity but, together with solar hot water systems, would greatly
reduce energy costs for families and businesses.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Vancouver City Council direct staff to:
a. Consult with appropriate agencies including BC Hydro, renewable energy
experts, and relevant contractor and trades worker associations, including
Metro Vancouver Zero Emissions Innovation Centre (ZEIC), regarding
how best to expedite increasing the supply of renewable energy in
Vancouver;
b. Consult with the appropriate B.C. government ministries regarding their
timelines and processes for implementing the renewable energy-related
motions tabled by the City of Vancouver and passed unanimously or
near-unanimously at the 2022 UBCM convention, including provincial
requirements for installation of renewable energy systems, training of
installers, and consumer rebates for solar PVC and solar hot water
systems;
c. Evaluate the potential of different types of renewable energy, including
solar photovoltaic systems, solar hot water systems, wind and renewable
district energy systems, to reduce Vancouver city’s GHGs, increase
reliability of energy supply and reduce consumers’ energy costs;
d. Determine changes that would be needed in the Vancouver Building By-
law and other by-laws, policies and codes to enable expanding renewable
energy production in Vancouver; and
e. Report back to Council by Q4 2023 with results of the above work and a
plan that includes options, costs and benefits, and timelines for the City of
Vancouver to aggressively pursue increasing production of renewable
energy within city limits.

more access to depots within the city boundary and specifically they are looking at other models
instead of bricks and mortar, as shipping containers are being looked at in other jurisdictions.
She advised that one of the areas they are struggling with is regulatory framework and how to
enable that on the permitting side and otherwise. She requested a memo back on this matter
and possibly a future Council briefing. The City Manager agreed to provide a response.
