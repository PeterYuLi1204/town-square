6. Election Readiness and Engagement
On November 13, 2018, Vancouver City Council referred the following Motion to the Standing
Committee on Policy and Strategic Priorities meeting on November 14, 2018, in order to hear
from speakers.
The registered speaker was not present in the Chamber.
The City Manager and the Chief Election Officer responded to questions.

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, November 14, 15, 27 and 28, 2018 12
MOVED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. Barriers in the electoral system can contribute to reduced participation.
2. In April 2018, Vancouver City Council voted to list mayoral, councillor and
Park Board commissioner candidates in random order instead of alphabetical
order on Vancouver’s municipal election ballots. This was purported to create a
more even playing field for candidates. A by-law was subsequently enacted by
Council per the provisions of Section 79 of the Vancouver Charter.
3. 60% of the 2018 Councillors-Elect appeared in the first one-third of the
one-version random ballot, and the Vancouver Charter did not permit multiple
versions of a random ballot thereby potentially creating an order bias or effect.
4. The April 2018, Motion entitled “Taking the ABCD Bias off the Ballot”, suggested
that alphabetical bias in the ballot has a particularly negative impact on people
who have last names that are Chinese, South Asian, Vietnamese, Korean,
Japanese or Latino - among others; however, cultural diversity on Council
actually decreased from 2014 to 2018.
5. The October 2018 Vancouver municipal election was also characterized by a
number of other factors including an unprecedented number of candidates, as
well as reliance on use of electronic ballot processing and counting machines.
6. Voters cited confusion and inertia at the overwhelming ballot length and random
form.
7. Long delays at voting locations across the city caused voter frustration and may
have contributed to limiting voter turnout. Voter turnout in 2018 is estimated at
39% vs 43.4% in 2014 despite continued utilization of increased advance voting
days as in 2011 and 2014, and implementation of a vote anywhere model in
2014.
8. Despite the city’s plan to have more staff and more voting booths available at
voting locations wherever possible, there appeared to be insufficient machines
available to process ballots which was a key factor in delays and in perception of
the integrity of the voting process.
9. The threshold for pre-qualification for people to submit their candidacy to run may
be considered low requiring signatures of 25 nominators and a $100 deposit
refunded after the election.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to prepare a 2018 Municipal
Election Review report to Council by May 2019 including but not limited to such factors
as the efficacy of the random ballot, pre-qualification requirements and sufficiency of
electoral resources including ballot counting machines, with the goal of supporting strong
voter turnout and confidence in the electoral process.

8. Setting New Standards: Expediting Development and Building Permits and
Examining Fees to Improve Affordability in the City of Vancouver
On November 13, 2018, Vancouver City Council referred the following Motion to the Standing
Committee on Policy and Strategic Priorities meeting on November 14, 2018, in order to hear
from speakers.
The Committee heard from two speakers in support of the motion.
The following Motion reflects changes to the original Motion on Notice that were accepted by the
Committee.
MOVED by Councillor De Genova
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS:
1. The City of Vancouver is unaffordable and has been named one of the least
affordable cities in the world to live.
2. In 2017, when speaking in Vancouver, Evan Siddall, President and CEO of
CHMC was quoted by the Vancouver Sun stating “The weak and lagging supply
response in Vancouver – rezoning restrictions, density limits, development fees
and the time it takes for approval of new supply – and not just for affordable
housing – needs urgent attention.
3. At the September 19, 2018, meeting of Vancouver City Council, a motion was put
forward by Councillor De Genova titled “Making Room for Families: Innovative
Solutions to Help Provide the Most Affordable Family Housing in the City of
Vancouver” was referred back to staff for incorporation in the report back on
housing initiatives to Council in January 2019.
4. The City of Vancouver Schedule of Development Fees are significantly higher in
many areas, including to approve air space parcels / subdivisions than the fees
required of municipalities in the Metro Vancouver region.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to explore possible ways to reduce development fees
that could directly impact affordability prior to bringing forward the final
recommendations for the 2019 City of Vancouver operating budget.
B. THAT staff review the staffing needs at the Development Centre and
Services Counter in Planning, Rezoning and Permitting and ensure that staffing
levels are adequate to significantly reduce permit wait times.
C. THAT staff review the schedule of fees, permit wait times and best practices of
other large municipalities in the City of Vancouver and consider changes that
may significantly improve the process of issuing building and development
permits;
FURTHER THAT staff report back to Council with their findings by February
2019.

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, November 14, 15, 27 and 28, 2018 14
D. THAT Council direct staff to further explore and consider a program to fast-track
the development and building permits process for architects and
builders submitting applications to the City of Vancouver.

9. Opioid Emergency Task Force
On November 13, 2018, Vancouver City Council referred the following Motion to the Standing
Committee on Policy and Strategic Priorities meeting on November 14, 2018, in order to hear
from speakers.
The Committee heard from two speakers in support of the motion who also stressed the need to
take action now.
MOVED by Mayor Stewart
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. On April 14, 2016, a public health emergency was declared by the Provincial
Health Officer of British Columbia due to the rise in overdose deaths due to
fentanyl poisoning, with the BC Coroner’s report confirming 995 people lost their
lives in BC due to overdose that year. Between 2016 and 2017, over 80% of
people dying in BC due to overdose were male and approximately 70% of people
who passed away were using alone.
2. In 2017, Vancouver lost 366 residents to overdoses, equal to one death per day,
and year-to-date data for 2018 indicates over 300 additional people have died in
Vancouver, the ongoing ‘epicentre’ of Canada’s opioid crisis. Indigenous
residents have been typically overrepresented in the crisis, with Indigenous
women especially impacted by high overdose rates.

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, November 14, 15, 27 and 28, 2018 15
3. The Urban Indigenous Opioid Task Force led by the Metro Vancouver Aboriginal
Executive Council provides a cultural response to the overdose crisis, including
integrated treatment programs, ‘Culture as Treatment’ for substance use
services, changes to drug policy, and a social determinants of health approach to
addressing the crisis.
4. People with lived experience, who are actively using opioids obtained through the
health system or other sources, have identified the need for health care

FINAL MOTION AS APPROVED
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. On April 14, 2016 a public health emergency was declared by the Provincial
Health Officer of British Columbia due to the rise in overdose deaths due to
fentanyl poisoning, with the BC Coroner’s report confirming 995 people lost their
lives in BC due to overdose that year. Between 2016 and 2017, over 80% of
people dying in BC due to overdose were male and approximately 70% of people
who passed away were using alone.
2. In 2017, Vancouver lost 366 residents to overdoses, equal to one death per day,
and year-to-date data for 2018 indicates over 300 additional people have died in
Vancouver, the ongoing ‘epicentre’ of Canada’s opioid crisis. Indigenous
residents have been typically overrepresented in the crisis, with Indigenous
women especially impacted by high overdose rates.
3. The Urban Indigenous Opioid Task Force led by the Metro Vancouver Aboriginal
Executive Council provides a cultural response to the overdose crisis, including
integrated treatment programs, ‘Culture as Treatment’ for substance use
services, changes to drug policy, and a social determinants of health approach to
addressing the crisis.
4. People with lived experience, who are actively using opioids obtained through the
health system or other sources, have identified the need for health care
interventions as well as initiatives targeting the social determinants of health to

people of African descent, Indigenous people, and people who make up the
diversity in the Downtown Eastside, with half the units being for women, some

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, November 14, 15, 27 and 28, 2018 26
The following Motion reflects changes to the original Motion on Notice that were accepted by the
Committee.
MOVED by Councillor Swanson
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. We have a housing emergency in Vancouver and one big part of that emergency
is caused when investors renovict tenants from moderately priced rental
buildings in order to turn them into luxury commodities.
2. We need immediate action to save renters from eviction and to preserve
affordable rental housing.
3. The Goodman Report on Vancouver apartment building sales from January 2018
through October 24, 2018, says that 56 buildings with 2456 units have been sold
in Vancouver.
4. A profit motive exists to displace existing long-term residents in order to increase
rental revenues.
5. Tenants are being approached by their new landlords, sometimes harassed and
pressured to accept buy-outs without being fully informed of their rights.
6. Such buy-outs are occurring before the landlord is eligible to legally issue notice
under the Residential Tenancy Act.
7. Many of these tenants have to find new apartments paying hundreds of dollars
more per month or move out of the City.
8. Evicted tenants have fewer resources left to spend on necessities and in local
businesses.
9. Losing affordable rental housing stock to renoviction and buyouts will nullify the
positive impact of new lower income social housing that governments and
non-profits can build.
10. The BC Tenancy Policy Guideline of May 2018 says a landlord cannot end a
tenancy for the purpose of renovations or repairs if “It is possible to carry out the
renovations or repairs without ending the tenancy (i.e. if the tenant is willing to
temporarily empty or vacate the unit during the renovations or repairs, and then
move back in once they are complete)”.
11. The buyout and renoviction process is incredibly stressful and anxiety-producing
for tenants.
12. The implementation of vacancy control at the provincial level could substantively
resolve some of these problems.
13. The province’s Rental Housing Task Force will be making recommendations this
month.

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, November 14, 15, 27 and 28, 2018 27
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT the City immediately amend its Tenant Relocation and Protection Policy to
the extent of its authority under the Vancouver Charter to:
i apply to all forms of rental accommodation, all areas of Vancouver and to
all permits which will result in the temporary or permanent displacement
of tenants; and
ii require landlords to offer displaced tenants the opportunity to temporarily
move out for the necessary duration of the renovations without their
leases ending or rent increasing, in accordance with the Residential
Tenancy Act and the Residential Tenancy Branch Policy Guideline 2 of
May 2018.
B. THAT the City devise methods to keep track of all apartment buildings sold in
Vancouver and immediately provide affected tenants with information as to their
tenancy rights by mail.
C. THAT the City explore measures, including changes to the Vancouver Charter if
necessary, to regulate and publicly register all tenant buyouts.
D. THAT the City immediately and forcefully call on the province to implement
effective vacancy controls for British Columbia, or alternatively, to give
Vancouver the power to regulate maximum rent increases during and between
tenancies.
