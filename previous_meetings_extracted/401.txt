Climate Emergency Implementation Update” for information;
FURTHER THAT Council direct staff to report back in Q2 on a restatement of the
Climate Emergency Action Plan (CEAP) budget and revised summary of proposed City
investments for actions outlined in the CEAP, given that Council has determined not to
proceed with Vancouver only transport pricing and has increased investment in the
2023-2026 Capital Plan amongst other factors, and further that the summary provide
information on expected outcomes and contributions of each investment towards
reducing carbon pollution and reducing future costs;
AND FURTHER THAT Council direct staff to update the CEAP plan by Q2 to reflect the
City of Vancouver’s full and complete operating budget and capital spending on direct
climate mitigation and adaptation, and all projects that support climate mitigation and
adaptation and the plan’s big moves, including but not limited to new community facilities
such as community centres, libraries, fire halls, retrofits to and rebuilds of community
and civic facilities, grey and green sewer and rainwater capture infrastructure (including
sewer separation), natural features, biodiversity initiatives, pedestrian pathways and bike
lane improvements and expansions (for example improvements on the Granville Street
Bridge), new parks and green space, annual tree planting, electrification of City vehicle
fleets including fire and police vehicles, organics management and EV charging

infrastructure, in order to capture and communicate the City’s full ongoing annual and
four-year capital plan investments towards reducing carbon pollution and emissions.
amended
AMENDMENT MOVED by Councillor Boyle
THAT the following be added to the end of the motion:
FURTHER THAT Council reaffirm its commitment to acting urgently within our
jurisdiction to get the Climate Emergency Action Plan back on track to meet our
science-based climate targets, in ways that improve health, safety and equity;
FURTHER THAT Council direct staff to explore and report back on requiring
Multiple Conversion Dwellings to achieve new construction outcomes for heating

AND FURTHER THAT Council direct staff to explore and report back on
expanding the Passive House incentives for multiplexes.
carried
* * * * *
During discussion on the amendment, Councillor Carr rose on a point of information to ask for
clarification from legal staff to provide Council with an opinion as to whether the carrying of the
main motion could be the basis for Item 4 on the agenda, entitled “Climate Action Costs and
Benefits (Members’ Motion B4)”, being ruled out of order.
Councillor Kirby-Yung then rose on a point of order to ask if the point of information was in order
as she did not think Council could contemplate future business in terms of Council needing to
deal with the item currently on the floor, versus what might potentially happen during a future
item.
Following a recess from 11 am to 11:30 am, the Chair advised first on the point of order, and
ruled that the point of information was not material to what was on the Council floor. The Chair
then requested Council the liberty to allow him to ask the City Manager for a response to the
point of information, despite it not being in order. The City Manager then provided a response
noting that it is possible that Item 4 could be ruled out of order due to the substance of both
motions for Items 1 and 4, but it would not be known until Council approved a motion on Item 1.
* * * * *
Following the ruling of the Chair and the comments from the City Manager, the amendment was
put and CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY (Vote No. 09032), with Mayor Sim absent for the vote.
AMENDMENT MOVED by Councillor Carr
THAT the following be added to the end of the motion:

Minutes, Wednesday, February 15, 2023 4
FURTHER THAT City Council direct staff to:
a. Prepare an overview to help inform Council’s decision-making on the City
of Vancouver’s 2023 Operating Budget on how much of the operating
budget is directly related to climate action, what that funding is used for,
and how it benefits the City and residents, including positive impacts on
health and air quality and helping avoid or reduce future costs of coping
with climate impacts.
b. Report back by the end of 2023 and thereafter on an annual basis to
update Council with a “carbon budget” that more thoroughly presents the
current and anticipated costs and benefits of the City’s climate emergency
action regarding:
i. additional repair, replacement or increase of city-owned
infrastructure necessitated by the impacts of climate change (i.e., -
3- beyond the costs of meeting the needs of new development
and scheduled infrastructure maintenance and replacement
related to regular use, wear and tear);
ii. likely future climate impacts on Vancouver should the City not take
appropriate climate adaptation measures;
iii. planned or proposed adaptation or resilience measures required
to prepare for future climate impacts, and the extent to which
those measures are likely to reduce the costs in b.i and/or b.ii;
iv. the results of mitigation measures in terms of actual and expected
direct GHG reductions and whether the measures put the City on
track to achieve its climate goals;
v. the social and economic benefits of the City’s climate emergency
actions, including for the most vulnerable people in our city;
AND FURTHER THAT City Council direct staff to include in the annual reports
recommendations on how to maximize the positive benefits to the City of climate
action, including how to better avoid climate costs and minimize the negative
impacts of our changing climate.

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, February 15, 2023 9
MOVED by Councillor Bligh
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. On January 1, 2022, the minimum fee of $0.25 for each single-use beverage cup
distributed under the City’s By-laws came into effect (i.e., License By-law No.
4450 and Ticket Offences By-law No. 9360);
2. In the days following the January 1, 2022, implementation of the $0.25 fee on
single-use beverage cups, numerous unintended consequences and publicly-
identified concerns became apparent almost immediately and were widely
reported in the media and on social media. Not the least of these were the equity
impacts that the new fee was having on the most vulnerable persons in our
community;
3. On January 25, 2022, in the wake of the single-use beverage cup fee
implementation on January 1, 2022, Council unanimously directed staff to report
back – on an urgent basis – by or before March 15, 2022, in order to provide
Council with a better understanding of the known facts and experiences to date
relative to the $0.25 single-use beverage cup fee;
4. At the March 2, 2022, Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic
Priorities, staff reported back to Council (i.e., Agenda Item 1: Revisiting the City’s
Single-Use Beverage Cup Fee Policy), with a number of recommendations
including exempting drinks “provided at no cost to the customer from the cup fee
requirement,” such as free drink vouchers and monetary gift vouchers,
developing low barrier cup-share programs that can be accessed by people
experiencing poverty or living with low incomes, and approving, in principle, by-
law amendments that require food vendors to accept a customer’s reusable cup
for in-store orders;
5. The ongoing experience and feedback regarding the City’s $0.25 single-use
beverage cup fee clearly indicates that the policy has not been effective in
accomplishing its intended objectives (i.e., to change consumer behaviour,
reduce the use of single-use beverage cups that ultimately end up in the landfill,
and encourage people to switch to reusable cups);
6. Single-use beverage cups are recyclable and they are included in residential blue
bin programs, including the City of Vancouver’s blue bin program. Once the
recycled cups arrive at an end processor, they are shredded and washed and the
plastic component separated from the fibre component. The recaptured fibre is a
valuable resource;
7. The City has a Vancouver Zero Waste Centre located at 8588 Yukon Street that
accepts Printed paper, Paper packaging, Cardboard boxes, Plastic containers,
Metal containers, Cartons and paper cups, Glass bottles and jars, Foam
packaging, Plastic bags and overwrap, Other Flexible Plastic Packaging;

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, February 15, 2023 10
8. Likewise, Recycle BC has a network of depots across BC where residents can
drop off packaging and paper free of charge. Most depots accept all materials
including paper, packaging, cardboard boxes, plastic containers, metal
containers, cartons and paper cups, non-deposit glass bottles and jars, foam
packaging, plastic bags and overwrap, and other flexible plastic packaging;
9. Subsequent to the implementation of the City’s $0.25 fee on single-use beverage
cups, Return-It and several companies such as Tim Hortons and Starbucks (with
involvement by City) initiated a pilot project to reduce single-use cup waste –
see: Reusable and Single-Use Cup Recycling Pilot (https://www.return-
it.ca/cups);
10. Similarly, the Binners' Project, as an example, hosts an annual Coffee Cup
Revolution event to demonstrate what a coffee cup refund system could achieve,
as well as to open the dialogue around how binning can support green
communities, and vice versa. Coffee Cup Revolution participants exchange tens
of thousands of cups during the event for a 10¢ refund. Since the start of the
Coffee Cup Revolution, binners in Vancouver have reportedly collected nearly
400,000 coffee cups by way of these annual events;
11. The City remains committed to reducing waste and litter from single-use items as
we work toward becoming a zero waste community by 2040, including reducing
the use of single-use beverage cups that otherwise end up in the landfill as well
as encouraging people to switch to reusable cups as an alternative;
12. Given the overwhelmingly clear, unambiguous evidence that has accumulated
over the past year since the introduction of the City’s $0.25 single-use beverage
cup fee, notably its failure to change consumer behaviour in the manner
intended, it is incumbent upon Council to explore other policy options and
pathways in order to achieve the desired and intended waste reduction
outcomes.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council instruct the Director of Legal Services to
prepare amendments to the License By-law No. 4450 and the Ticket Offences By-law
No. 9360 to repeal those sections enacted by Council on January 21, 2020, relating to
single-use beverage cups, including any relevant by-law amendments enacted
concurrently and/or subsequently, at the earliest possible date but no later than June 1,
2023;
FURTHER THAT staff be directed to report back to Council by 2023 Q4 with policy
recommendations and alternative pathways that can effectively, efficiently, and
measurably achieve the waste reduction and behaviour change outcomes anticipated in
the implementation of the $0.25 single-use beverage cup fee, including recycling options
and initiatives;
AND FURTHER THAT Council resolve to work with provincial and federal counterparts
to facilitate and enable prompt, coordinated action on single-use items toward
comprehensive regional, provincial, and national strategies and actions.
carried

Following the amendment below being put on the floor of Council, Mayor Sim rose to declare a
conflict of interest on this item, out of an abundance of caution, as he has a company that uses
single use beverage cups. He left the meeting at 5:48 pm and did not return for the remainder of
the meeting.
* * * * *
AMENDMENT MOVED by Councillor Fry
THAT the following be added as the second clause:
FURTHER THAT Council direct staff to prepare amendments to the License
