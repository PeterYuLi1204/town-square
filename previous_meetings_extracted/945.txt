1. Review of SNC-Lavalin Relationship with the City of Vancouver
MOVED by Councillor Hardwick
SECONDED by Councillor De Genova
WHEREAS
1. On January 30, 2019, Vancouver City Council endorsed a SkyTrain Millennium
Line extension from Arbutus Street to the University of British Columbia (UBC);
2. SkyTrain is TransLink's name for the Vancouver region's rail system which has
two main types of technology, the Canada Line that is conventional and the Expo
and Millennium Lines that are unconventional. The unconventional Millennium
Line technology would apply to the proposed extension to UBC, of which SNC
Lavalin (track and electrics) and Bombardier (cars) partnered to build the
SkyTrain Millennium Line;
3. On February 11, 2019, it was announced that Federal Ethics Commissioner
Mario Dion will investigate allegations that the Prime Minister's Office pressured
former attorney general Jody Wilson-Raybould to help Quebec engineering firm
SNC-Lavalin avoid criminal prosecution;
4. Ongoing media reports since February 6, 2019, have exposed the current status
of corruption charges related to the SNC-Lavalin Group Inc., involving alleged
bribery and fraud. In the wake of a failed bid for judicial review, the appearance is
that Public Prosecution Service of Canada is likely to proceed with a trial rather
than a negotiated settlement agreement;
5. Bombardier is also reported as being investigated for allegations of corruption
through a World Bank audit and has been struggling to produce trains for existing
orders for rail equipment or to fix equipment problems. The New York City Transit
Authority announced as reported on January 24, 2019, that they are halting
delivery of any new train cars from Bombardier until more of the existing ones are
fixed;

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, April 23, 2019 43
6. City Council endorsement of Broadway rapid transit extension to UBC as
SkyTrain Millennium Line technology was rushed in consideration of potential
funding in the Federal budget announced March 19, 2019, that did not
materialize;
7. City of Vancouver statements of financial information show a total of $2,916,452
in payments to SNC-Lavalin between 2010 and 2017;
8. Part of the project approval process for the subway SkyTrain Millennium Line
extension is the consideration by the TransLink Mayors’ Council, which endorsed
SkyTrain at their meeting on February 15, 2019, subject to confirmation from staff
regarding the proprietary rights of SNC-Lavalin and the ability to get competitive
bids;
9. The recent 2019 McElhanney draft report, that both the City of Vancouver and
the TransLink Mayors’ Council based the decision to endorse SkyTrain
technology for a Millennium Line extension of the subway Arbutus to UBC, was
an update of the former 2012 report by SNC-Lavalin / Steer Davies Gleave report
that recommended the SkyTrain Millennium Line extension to Broadway;
10. A criminal conviction against SNC-Lavalin could result in them not being allowed
to bid on either the phase 1 Millennium Line extension Broadway subway from
VCC to Arbutus or the phase 2 extension from Arbutus to UBC;
11. Council requires all related information to make informed decisions.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council instruct staff to report back to Council with a thorough review of
the existing relationship between the City of Vancouver, SNC Lavalin, and
Bombardier, including the procurement relationship.
B. THAT Council instruct staff to report back to Council with information on how
SkyTrain use as a Millennium Line extension could be affected by further
outcomes of the criminal prosecution for corruption charges of SNC-Lavalin
Group Inc. and the World Bank's audit of Bombardier for allegations of
corruption.
C. THAT Council instruct staff to consult with TransLink staff and report back to
Council on the results as soon as available from the TransLink staff report to the
Mayors’ Council on any proprietary rights or bidding advantage of SNC-Lavalin
and Bombardier for the SkyTrain Millennium Line extension and the ability for
other firms to bid competitively.
D. THAT the above information be provided to Council, and before any further
Council decisions are made on a Broadway subway phase 1 or phase 2 for a
SkyTrain Millennium Line extension, Council should consider whether any
information required by this motion has not been presented to Council, and
whether any decision should be delayed until that information is fully reviewed
and confirmed to Council’s satisfaction.

2. Safer Slower Streets: 30 km/h Residential Street Pilot
MOVED by Councillor Fry
SECONDED by Councillor Carr
WHEREAS
1. Currently, the Motor Vehicle Act (“MVA”) stipulates a speed limit of 50 kilometers
per hour (“km/h”) within city limits;
2. The probability of pedestrian survival is about 90% if struck by a motor vehicle
travelling at 30 km/h, while survival is reduced to 20% if struck by a motor vehicle
travelling at 50 km/h;
3. Lower speed limits are more compatible with active transportation, and create
safer, better engaged, healthier and more inclusive communities;
4. In 2012, the City of Vancouver’s Pedestrian Safety Study identified that mixed
mode roadways allow for shared use of space by motor vehicles, pedestrians,
and bicyclists without lane assignment. These roadways typically have posted
reduced speed limits, while improving public realm, social connectivity, and
increasing active transportation;
5. In 2015, the BC Road Safety Strategy set out the goal of zero traffic fatalities and
serious injuries and discussed safe speeds. In 2016, the Provincial Health
Officer’s Annual Report also recommended a 30 km/h speed limit in urban areas;
6. In 2016, the City of Vancouver launched its action plan “Moving Towards Zero”
which is linked to Vision Zero, an international framework and project that
prioritizes road traffic safety over speed or convenience and emphasizes that the
responsibility for safety is shared by transportation system designers and road
users;
7. In June 2016, as part of its position paper, Modernizing the BC Motor Vehicle
Act, the British Columbia-based Road Safety Law Reform Group recommended:
“A default provincial speed limit of 30 km/h for local (no centre line) streets
should be included in the Motor Vehicle Act, with municipalities enabled to
increase speed limits on local streets in a case-by-case basis by by-law and
posted signage.”;

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, April 23, 2019 45
8. In 2018, the provincial government’s B.C. Community Road Safety Toolkit
recommended lower speed limits in downtown areas and residential roads;
9. Today, Vancouver has a 30 km/h limit on designated bike routes, in school and
playground zones during posted times and on local streets. Additionally,
Vancouver has designated a portion of Hastings Street, 29th Avenue and Victoria
Drive with 30 km/h limit. However, a blanket speed limit reduction for local streets
would require changes to the Motor Vehicle Act or significant signage and
roadwork by the city;
10. Vancouver’s goal is Moving Towards Zero Fatalities and Serious Injuries.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to submit the following resolution along with the above
preamble (articles 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8) for consideration at the Lower Mainland Local
Government Association and/or working with other municipalities to present at
Union of BC Municipalities: “Therefore be it resolved that the Union of BC
Municipalities lobby the province to amend the Motor Vehicle Act to a default
speed limit of 30 kilometers per hour for local streets with municipalities enabled
to increase speed limits on local streets in a case-by-case basis by by-laws and
posted signage.”
B. THAT Council direct staff to develop a pilot 30 kilometers per hour speed limit
demonstration project, focused on mixed mode use, reduced speeds, and
complimentary road design with a mechanism to record and analyze before and
after data.
C. THAT Council direct staff to identify a local street, area, or areas within the city to
pilot a 30 kilometer per hour speed limit demonstration project and report back
with implementation strategy, timing, and budget as well as proposed road
design changes by Q3 2019.
