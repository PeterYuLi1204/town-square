Special Council Meeting
Minutes, Thursday, October 25, 2018 3
Eric Wen was present as Agent on behalf of the Appellant, for the property located at 1 Broadway E.
Bob Thompson, Colliers International, was present as Agent on behalf of the Appellants for the
properties located at:
1527 Main St.
3695 Lougheed Highway

Mr. Murray provided an overview of the Land Averaging Appeal process pursuant to Section 9
of the 2018 and 2017 Land Assessment Averaging By-laws, and Council’s role sitting as a Court
of Revision pursuant to Section 10 of the above-noted by-laws. He also noted a page was
inadvertently excluded from Tab 4 of the brief concerning 1527 Main St., and distributed copies.
1. 1 Broadway E., Vancouver, BC (Owner/Agent: Eric Wen)
Roll # 650-184-05-0000
Mr. Murray introduced the appeal for the above-noted property as set out under Tab 3 of the
brief. He advised that the property was subject to a Class change and that the issue before the
Court of Revision was the effect of the Class change, and whether the property should be
exempt from the tax averaging formula.
Mr. Wen submitted that the property is owned by Shandong Natives Association of BC
(SDNABC), a non-profit community association, and that the building was mainly leased to
small, local businesses with the exception of 17% which was used by SDNABC. He noted that
in 2018 BC Assessment recognized 17% of the property was being used for non-profit purposes
and changed that portion from Class 6 to Class 8. Mr. Wen pointed out that the other 83%
remained Class 6 with no Class changes and that the land value increased significantly in the
last few years, making it a ‘target property’ which should qualify for land assessment averaging.
In closing, he advised that the Appellant and tenants have been struggling as a result of the
significant property tax increase in 2018 and hoped the Court of Revision would reconsider
whether the property should be subject to the land assessment averaging formula. Mr. Wen also
responded to questions.
Mr. Radakovich submitted the City’s position, noting the property was exempt from land
assessment averaging pursuant to Section 3 (b)(iv) of the 2018 Land Assessment Averaging
By-law, and responded to questions.
Mr. Wen responded noting the property use did not change since 1995 and regardless of the
change from Class 6 to both Class 6 and Class 8 in 2018, felt that the property use was still the
same. He also referred to the definition of “target parcel” under Section 2 of the By-Law, and
pointed out that the intent is to allow for land assessment averaging on any parcel or part of a
parcel.
Mr. Murray provided closing comments and responded to questions related to Mr. Wen’s
interpretation of “target parcel” and whether language could be added to the By-law in future
that specifically outlines whether and how the effect of a Class change could result in prorating
the applicable taxes.

Special Council Meeting
Minutes, Thursday, October 25, 2018 4
MOVED by Councillor Deal
SECONDED by Councillor Affleck
THAT Vancouver City Council, sitting as the Court of Revision, dismiss the Land
Averaging Appeal by the owner of the property located at 1 Broadway East, Vancouver,
BC, as there has been no error demonstrated in the application of By-Law No. 12066,
the 2018 Land Assessment Averaging By-law.
CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY (Vote No. 03396)
2. 1527 Main St., Vancouver, BC (Owner/Agent: Colliers International)
Roll # 190-630-13-0000
Mr. Murray introduced the appeal for the above-noted property as set out under Tab 4 of the
brief. He advised that the complaint was based on Section 3 (b)(iv) of the 2018 Land
Assessment Averaging By-law, and that the property was subject to a class change. He also
noted that the property underwent a zoning change. Mr. Murray pointed out that the issue
before the Court of Revision was the effect of the class change and whether the property should
be subject to the tax averaging formula.
Mr. Thompson submitted that the change from Class 1 and Class 6 in 2017, to Class 6 in 2018, was
the result of a change to the Southeast False Creek Official Development Plan (SEFC ODP) by the
Director of Planning in relation to the rezoning of an adjacent property. He pointed out that the
change was not due to any application or action taken by the Appellant, but rather was the result of
a change in the SEFC ODP. In closing, he noted that the Class change was the basis for exclusion
of the subject property from tax averaging and that it should be included. Mr. Thompson responded
to questions.
Mr. Radakovich submitted the City’s position, noting this was not the result of a zoning change
to an adjacent property but rather was a change in Class to the subject property, which was the
basis for exclusion of the property from tax averaging.
In response, Mr. Thompson pointed out that the zoning change to the adjacent property was
initiated by that property owner but the zoning change to the subject property was initiated by
the Director of Planning. As a result, the Appellant’s property decreased in value and lost tax
averaging. Mr. Thompson responded to questions.
Mr. Murray provided closing comments, noting the property was subject to a Class change and
that there was no error in applying the 2018 Land Assessment Averaging By-law. Mr. Murray,
along with Mr. Radakovich, responded to questions.

Minutes, Thursday, October 25, 2018 5

Roll # 650-312-95-0000
Mr. Murray introduced the appeal for the above-noted property as set out under Tab 5 of the
brief. He advised that the appeal was based on interpretation of the 2018 Land Assessment
Averaging By-law, generally under Section 4 and what constitutes a “target property”, adding
the issue before the Court of Revision was whether the property should have been subject to
the tax averaging formula.
Mr. Thompson submitted that this appeal was based on the definition of ‘average’ and referred
to Sections 3 and 4 of the By-law. He advised that based on his interpretation, the subject
property was a ‘target parcel’ and should have qualified for tax averaging.
Mr. Radakovich presented the City’s position on the averaging process and responded to
questions.
In response, Mr. Thompson questioned the City’s process of calculating average value and
responded to questions.
Mr. Murray provided closing comments.

Roll # 837-197-65-0000
Mr. Murray introduced the appeal for the above-noted property as set out under Tab 6 of the
brief and advised that it was based on the interpretation of Section 4 of the 2018 Land
Assessment Averaging By-law, noting the City’s understanding was that this appeal was
substantially the same as Item 3 above.
Mr. Thompson waived his submission and suggested Items 4 to 7 be consolidated as the argument
for each property was generally the same.
In response, Mr. Murray provided the Court of Revision with procedural advice in regard to
considering Items 4 to 7 concurrently.
The Court of Revision agreed to proceed based on Mr. Murray’s advice.

parcel.
