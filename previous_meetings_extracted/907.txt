2. Combatting Antisemitism in Vancouver
MOVED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
SECONDED by Councillor Dominato
WHEREAS
1. The City of Vancouver is committed to combating all forms of hatred, including
antisemitism;
2. The City is actively working on the development of an Equity Framework;
3. Statistics Canada reports that members of the Jewish community are the most
frequently targeted ethno-cultural group when it comes to police-reported hate
crimes;
4. Research demonstrates that we are witnessing a global rise in antisemitism, as
evidenced by horrific attacks targeting synagogues in recent months. As a result,
Jewish community-facing organizations in Vancouver have been forced to invest
in visible security presence at their facilities;
5. Every person in the City of Vancouver has the right to realize their potential
without fear of discrimination, and to live in conditions of dignity, respect and
peace;
6. On May 26, 2016, the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance Plenary, of
which the Government of Canada is a member, adopted a working definition of
antisemitism and list of illustrative examples;
7. On June 25, 2019, the Minister of Canadian heritage and Multiculturalism
announced that the Government of Canada would officially adopt the
International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) working definition of
antisemitism and list of illustrative examples as part of Canada's new anti-racism
strategy;
8. In 2017, police-reported hate crimes targeting members of the Canadian Jewish
community reached 360 and rose by 60% in a single year, according to Statistics
Canada. An anti-Semitic hate crime takes place once every 24 hours in Canada;
9. On June 12, 2019, VPD hate crimes unit reported that members of the Jewish
community are the most targeted group when it comes to hate crimes in the city,
followed by Muslims, LGBTQ community members, and Asian and black
communities. In the City of Vancouver, hate crimes and hate crime incidents
increased from 61 in 2016 to 141 in 2018;
10. The rise in hate crimes and anti-Semitism is alarming and contradicts
fundamental values enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and the BC Human Rights Code.
Antisemitism can only be overcome by education, increased awareness-raising

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, July 23, 2019 28
efforts, strong political condemnation, and enforcement of relevant laws.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT the City of Vancouver adopt the International

i. “Antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as
hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of
antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or
their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious
facilities.”;
FURTHER THAT Council direct staff to share this motion and the International
Holocaust Remembrance Alliance non-legally binding working definition of antisemitism
with the Vancouver Police Department, Vancouver Public Library, Vancouver Park
Board and Vancouver School Board for their review and consideration as an additional
practical tool, in addition to any existing working definitions, in identifying antisemitism.

3. Every Neighbourhood for Everyone: Permitting Temporary Modular Housing and
Low-Income Housing as an Option in RS and RT Zones
MOVED by Councillor Boyle
WHEREAS
1. The abundance of people impacted by homelessness in Vancouver represents a
humanitarian crisis which the City of Vancouver is morally obligated to address;

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, July 23, 2019 29
2. On Wednesday, June 12, 2019, City of Vancouver staff released the 2019
homelessness count, which counted 2,223 Vancouverites who identified as
homeless, the highest number since the City began tracking. This figure is a two
per cent increase from 2018, representing the fourth straight year the number of
individuals impacted by homelessness has grown;
3. These numbers express a slower growth rate of homelessness than in previous
years, demonstrating that the actions taken by the City, including the provision of
temporary modular housing complexes, are having a positive, though inadequate
impact;
4. Homelessness disproportionately impacts systemically marginalized communities
including: Indigenous peoples (39%), Individuals with mental health conditions
(44%), or those with physical disabilities (38%). 81% of respondents who
identified as homeless stated that they had lived in the city of Vancouver before
they became homeless;
5. As of July 2017, there were 4,789 individuals waitlisted for social housing in the
City of Vancouver.1 Also as of July 2017, there was a 43% decrease in private
SRO rooms affordable to those on Provincial assistance since 2007;
6. The BC NDP rolled out its Rapid Response to Homelessness Program in 2017,
pledging $291 million to build 2,000 modular housing units province wide, 600 of
which were built in Vancouver, and an additional $170 million to operate them. In
the 2019 budget, the province announced another $76 million to build an
additional 200 modular units in BC;
7. In 2017, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau committed to cutting homelessness in
half in a 10 year time frame;
8. On July 28, 2011, Council endorsed the Housing and Homelessness Strategy
2012-2021 which includes strategic directions to create more affordable housing,
including housing that is affordable for low and moderate income households.
The Strategy strives to increase the variety of affordable housing options across
the entire housing continuum. (Policy Report dated October 25, 2016, entitled
“Temporary Modular Housing Definition and Regulations: Proposed Amendments
to Existing City-Owned CD-1 Sites, and Design Guidelines”);
9. In 2011, Vancouver City Council passed the Motion, Modular Housing, which
directed the City Manager to undertake an expression of interest to ascertain the
range of possible ties and partnerships available to pursue an initiative involving
modular housing option, using city and private resources as an enabler, to
address unmet housing need while sufficient permanent housing stock is being
built;

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, July 23, 2019 30
10. In September 2016, City staff developed a three year shelter and housing
demand and supply plan to better understand when and where the pressures will
be experienced over the next three years as a result of the need to address the
increasing number of individuals experiencing street homelessness. Temporary
Modular Housing is included in the three year plan because it provides an
opportunity to create more deeply affordable homes quickly and cost effectively;
11. On December 4, 2018, Vancouver City Council passed a Motion Calling for 600
More Units of Modular Housing in 2019, where by City Council directed staff to
find sites for 600 more modular housing units;
12. Temporary Modular Housing targets low and moderate income households who
have a need for transitional accommodation, and provide residence with a
number of supports, such as life skills training as well as health and social
services;
13. After a year of operations, many of the fears community members had about
Temporary Modular Housing sites have subsided;
14. Temporary Modular Housing (TMH) is currently permitted in CD-1 districts,
targeting vacant or under-utilized sites pending development. Under current
Vancouver zoning by-laws, the land options for the provision of modular housing
is extremely limited, and is quickly diminishing, as the need for additional TMH
and the relocation of current TMH becomes necessary;
15. The current limitation of Temporary Modular Housing being solely single
occupancy units has the unintentional impacts of prioritizing individuals while
excluding low-income families, mothers and youth. There is a significant need to
expand modular housing to include family-sized units, to meet the needs of these
residents of our city;
16. Some areas of Vancouver remain predominated RS and RT zones, resulting in
high housing prices and very limited land options for temporary modular housing
under current by-laws;
17. Where zoning by-laws are overly restrictive and segregate uses unnecessarily,
they can act as impediments to healthy urban development;
18. Amending Vancouver’s zoning by-laws to permit modular housing on RS and RT
zones would provide the necessary options to meet the growing demand for
modular housing and will significantly impact the unprecedented levels of
homeless in the city of Vancouver;
19. Those experiencing homelessness come from every neighbourhood of our city,
and so housing for homeless and low-income residents should be available in
every neighbourhood of our city;

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, July 23, 2019 31
20. Vancouver City Council is considering launching a City-wide Planning Process,
where prior, City Council has expressed key goals and objectives to guide a City
wide planning effort, which includes:
a. Maintaining Vancouver as a diverse and inclusive community;
b. Increasing and protecting housing supply that is locally affordable;
c. Enhancing social well-being;
d. Planning for complete neighbourhoods, exploring new housing types and
densities.
21. What is needed is permanent affordable housing, across the city. Modular
housing is a relatively inexpensive opinion and can be built more quickly than
traditional construction projects. Given the urgency of homelessness, temporary
modular housing is needed too;
22. Homeless is not restricted by municipal or territorial boundaries and requires a
joint approach, across jurisdictional lines, to successfully address all causes of
homelessness and to provide the necessary services to immediately confront this
humanitarian crisis.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to:
i. Explore and report back on opportunities to deliver Temporary Modular
Housing (TMH) buildings for homeless residents, on RS and RT zoned
parcels on private and City-owned land that could accommodate the
footprint, access to services and/or transit, timing of future uses, and site
conditions by Q4 2019;
ii. If opportunities exist then the report back should identify policy tools that
may be required to advance delivering TMH on RS or RT zones, including
but not limited to, changes to the Vancouver Charter to enable Director of
Planning authority to relax for “low cost housing for persons receiving
assistance” in RS and RT areas, and/or new rezoning policies to enable
the same.
B. THAT Council direct staff to continue to explore, through the City-wide Plan as
well as through implementation of Housing Vancouver and the Affordable
Housing Delivery and Financial Strategy, additional possibilities for creating
permanent homes for low and moderate income families and individuals in all
neighbourhoods of the city, including:
i. The City of Vancouver (through the Property Endowment Fund or
Vancouver Affordable Housing Endowment Fund) purchasing RS/RT
properties to use for Temporary Modular Housing, with potential future
use for permanent secure rental and non-market housing options;
ii. Consideration of the development of an Affordable Housing Land
Acquisition Strategy, which would include a study into annual affordable
housing land needs; estimated land costs; location selection criteria, and

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, July 23, 2019 32
an Affordable Housing Funding Strategy including recommended levels of
funding from taxation and new development;
iii. Exploring existing and emerging possibilities for family-sized modular
housing units, in partnership with BC Housing and the Provincial
Government;
iv. Exploring through the City-wide Plan the potential for pre-approving social
and non-market housing projects in all parts of the city to make the
development of affordable housing faster and less risky;
v. Exploring expanded partnerships with non-profit housing providers in the
creation and operation of non-market housing;
vi. Ensuring that the important work to develop a comprehensive and
representative City-wide Plan, doesn’t delay the urgent work required to
address the humanitarian crisis which is homelessness and the
immediate need to provide housing for low and moderate income families
and individuals in all neighbourhoods of the city.
C. THAT Council direct the Mayor to continue to advocate to the Provincial
Government and the Federal Government for adequate funding and resources to
support a collaborative effort to immediately address homelessness within the
region.

4. Revisiting the Random Ballot for Equity’s Sake
MOVED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
SECONDED by Councillor Bligh
WHEREAS
1. Barriers in the electoral system can contribute to reduced voter participation;
2. One of the goals of the Healthy City Strategy is to increase voter turn-out, which
is a common proxy for measuring democracy, and the City is actively working on
the development of an Equity Framework;
3. In April 2018, Vancouver City Council voted to list Mayoral, Council and Park
Board Commissioner candidates in random order instead of alphabetical order
on Vancouver’s next municipal election in October that year. This was purported
to create a more even playing field for candidates. A by-law was subsequently
enacted by Council per the provisions of Section 79 of the Vancouver Charter;
4. The April 2018 Taking the ABCD Bias off the Ballot Motion suggested that
alphabetical bias in the ballot has a particularly negative impact on people who
have last names that are Chinese, South Asian, Vietnamese, Korean, Japanese
or Latino - among others; however, cultural representation actually decreased
following the 2018 election that used a random order ballot;
5. It has been suggested that switching from an alphabetically ordered to a random
order ballot could eliminate order bias. However, 60% of Councillors elected in
October 2018 appeared in the first one-third of the one-version random ballot,
indicating that one order bias was changed for another;
6. Voters cited confusion and inertia at the overwhelming ballot length and random
form for the October 2018 Vancouver municipal election;
7. In November 2018, Council directed staff to prepare a 2018 Municipal Election
Review report to Council by May 2019 including but not limited to such factors as
the efficacy of the random ballot, with the goal of supporting strong voter turnout
and confidence in the electoral process. Voter turnout in 2018 was 39% vs 43.4%
in 2014 not achieving the City’s goal of increasing civic participation;
8. The 2018 Municipal Election Review report indicated that random order ballots
were cited as more personally confusing by Chinese, South Asian and minority
voters compared to Caucasian voter survey respondents;
9. The same post-election survey indicated that Caucasian respondents were
significantly more likely to prefer random order ballots, compared to Chinese,
South Asian and minority respondents.

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, July 23, 2019 34
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council acknowledge that the 2018 Municipal Election Review report
indicated that random order ballots were cited as more confusing by Chinese,
South Asian and minority residents, and that given the goal of equity as well as
increasing voter turnout, it is prudent to reconsider the use of an alphabetical
versus a random order ballot for the next Vancouver municipal election as
permitted by Sections 78 and 79 of the Vancouver Charter.
B. THAT Council direct staff to engage with appropriate Resident Advisory
Committees for their feedback on the use of an alphabetical versus random order
ballot, including the Racial and Ethno-Cultural Equity Advisory Committee, Urban
Indigenous People’s Advisory Committee, Persons with Disabilities Advisory
Committee, and Seniors’ Advisory Committee.
C. THAT staff report back to Council by Q1 2020 with Committee feedback and
recommendations related to whether or not to return to an alphabetically ordered
ballot for the next Vancouver municipal election, including possible
recommendations for by-law enactment per the provisions of Section 79 of the
Vancouver Charter.

5. Options for an Accelerated 10-year Timeline for Addressing Vancouver’s
Combined Sewer Overflows
MOVED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
SECONDED by Councillor Wiebe
WHEREAS
1. As with many cities around the world, Vancouver has aging infrastructure that
has been deteriorating at a rate more rapid than renewal investment, while
pressures this aging infrastructure, combined with increased population density
and development intensity, climate change and sea level rise, and increased
regulations around environmental water quality, are having particularly significant
impacts on the City’s water, sewer, and drainage utility infrastructure;
2. The waterworks and sewer infrastructure of cities play an important role in
ensuring sustainability and resiliency by using water efficiently, by being aware of
what goes into the sewers, and by recognizing how local waterways can be
affected by sewage and storm water overflows;
3. The City of Vancouver’s Greenest City Action Plan, among others, embodies the
City’s aspiration to be on the leading edge of urban sustainability and resiliency
through a set of measurable and attainable targets;

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, July 23, 2019 36
4. The City of Vancouver has 2,117 km of sewer and drainage mains, as well as 24
pump stations, approximately 90,000 sewer connections, 45,000 catch basins,
and roughly 200 green infrastructure features, with an estimated replacement
value of $6.1 billion;
5. The bulk of Vancouver’s original wastewater and rainwater systems, which date
to the late 19th and early 20th centuries, were built with combined sewer pipes
that channel a mixture of rainwater, groundwater, and sewage through a single
sewer pipe;
6. Combined sewer pipes cannot handle all storm water runoff during periods of
prolonged or heavy rain, resulting in sewers that overflow and discharge raw
sewage into local waterways such as Burrard Inlet, English Bay, and the Fraser
River from a network of combined sewer outfalls along the city’s shorelines;
7. Raw sewage from combined sewer overflows, system cross-connections,
sewage discharge from boats and other sources are a major contributor to E.coli
and fecal contamination of public waterways;
8. The City of Vancouver has an on-going, multi-decade sewer capital program to
replace its combined sewer pipes with separated sewer pipes as part of renewal
and/or growth-triggered upgrades, which, in conjunction with targeted green
infrastructure, aims to reduce combined sewer overflows into Vancouver’s local
waterways, such as Burrard Inlet, English Bay, False Creek, and the Fraser
River, during heavy rain events, while providing increased sanitary capacity to
the sewer system to accommodate growth and directing rainwater to receiving
bodies that help reduce flooding concerns;
9. The City of Vancouver currently has both combined and separated areas in its
sewer systems. Some areas, such as Downtown, Still Creek and in the False
Creek Flats have the highest level of sewer separation;
10. Currently, Provincial Government regulations through the Integrated Liquid
Waste and Resource Management Plan requires the City of Vancouver to
eliminate combined sewer overflows by 2050 within a target rainfall event (1 in 5
year event);
11. In the 10 years from 2009 to 2018, the City of Vancouver reportedly replaced
83 km of combined sewers with 166 km of separated sewer mains, with
separation projects on major arterials such as Burrard, West 4th, Alma,
Southwest Marine, Dunbar, Nanaimo, and King Edward, as well as
approximately 10,000 associated sewer connections and replacement /
refurbishment of 5 sewer pump stations;
12. As noted in the City of Vancouver 2019-2022 Capital Plan, over the past
10 years, sewer mains have been replaced at an annual rate of 0.6 percent of
the system, with approximately 50 percent of the combined sewer system now
replaced and separated;
13. On June 29, 2019, Sunset Beach was closed to swimming on the

Minutes, July 23, 2019 37
recommendation of Vancouver Coastal Health due to high E.coli levels. It is not
clear which factors contributed to the high levels and such factors may or may
not have been combined sewer overflows, system cross-connections, boaters
discharging waste or other sources;
14. According to recent reports, almost 674,000 cubic metres of raw sewage and
runoff drained into False Creek last year from just one of the five False Creek
combined sewer overflow outfalls;
15. On May 30, 2017, the City of Vancouver established a waterfront initiative for
major natural waterways such as Burrard Inlet, False Creek, Lost Lagoon, the
Fraser River and Trout Lake, with improving water quality in False Creek as an
initial area of focus under the City’s waterfront initiative;
16. On November 1, 2017, the City of Vancouver adopted the Rain City Strategy
vision and goals, which includes improving water quality and reducing pollutants
discharged in to our local waters from combined sewer overflows and rainwater
run-off through the implementation of green rainwater infrastructure;
17. In 2019, the City plans to advance the development of a hydraulic model of the
False Creek Basin to better understand its complex nature, including flow
dynamics, contaminant fate and water quality performance to assist the City in
identifying action priorities and evaluating potential benefits and continue to work
with First Nations and regional and senior governments to advance additional
action initiatives, including supporting the development of emerging technologies
and techniques to better identify the primary sources of fecal contamination in
False Creek;
18. Metro Vancouver’s Liquid Waste Services division, which provides wastewater
collection and treatment services and administers the region’s Integrated Liquid
Waste and Resource Management Plan (ILWRMP), under the Greater
Vancouver Sewerage & Drainage District (GVS&DD), lists “commencing work
with the Cities of Burnaby, New Westminster and Vancouver to identify options
and strategies to cost effectively eliminate combined sewer overflows and
separate combined sewers” as key action items for 2019;
19. According to Metro Vancouver, the 4-year average annual combined sewer
overflow volume for the region from 2013 to 2016 was 27,300 megalitres (from
combined sewers in Vancouver, Burnaby, and New Westminster), while in 2017
Metro Vancouver’s combined sewer overflow volume was 33,300 megalitres and
in 2018 it was 41,300 megalitres – with a 2019 target of 28,500 megalitres;
20. The 5-year average for the number of annual wet-weather related sanitary sewer
overflow (SSO) events from Metro Vancouver sewers from 2012 t0 2016 was 20
events and 39 events were reported in 2017;
21. The City of Vancouver’s $1.5 billion Operating Budget and Fiscal Plan for 2019
includes a sewer utility rate increase of 11.0% to (1) meet the increase in Metro
Vancouver (regional) rates, including costs for site preparation for secondary

sewer capital projects, as outlined in the approved 2019-2022 Capital Plan, (3)
cover debt-servicing costs to support the replacement and separation of sewer
infrastructure to support the City’s goal to eliminate combined sewer overflows by
2050, and (4) allow for investments in flood mitigation and facility maintenance;
22. Metro Vancouver’s regional population growth estimates to the year 2050, based
on a base population of 2,570,000 in 2016, is anticipated to increase by about 1
million to 3,600,000 by the year 2050, with a corresponding increase in the
population of the City of Vancouver and similarly increased demands on the
City’s sewer systems and discharges of raw sewage into the city’s waterways.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Vancouver City Council direct staff to explore an
accelerated timeline for addressing the City’s combined sewer overflows, including (but
not limited to) potential costs, potential infrastructure funding partnerships and programs
(i.e., federal, provincial, regional, and/or in conjunction with other nearby municipalities),
potential pathways to cost effectively achieve accelerated water quality outcomes related
to combined sewer overflow events by 2029, the potential impact of accelerating
combined sewer overflow mitigation on other City of Vancouver budget priorities, and
any foreseeable obstacles, and for staff to report back to Council in 2020 with options for
an accelerated combined sewer overflow mitigation program;

2. The City of Vancouver has engaged in a variety of ways to strengthen women’s
equity, including through the creation of a Women’s Equity Strategy, unanimously
adopted;
3. In 2018, the City of Vancouver joined UN Women’s Global Flagship Initiative,
“Safe Cities and Safe Public Spaces” (“UN Women Safe Cities”);
4. Vancouver City Council recognizes that safe and healthy workplaces help attract
and retain families, and individuals to live and work in the city;
5. The City of Vancouver recognizes and supports the growth of the #MeToo
Movement across North America, the human rights of Women, and the need to
ensure workplaces in hospitality and service industries are free from sexual
assault and harassment;
6. The City of Victoria recently passed a motion to require, among other things,
sexual violence prevention training in the local service industry to ensure a
harassment-free environment;
7 Recent sexual harassment and sexual assault complaints have been raised at
luxury hotels in Vancouver;
8. Sexual assault reports in Vancouver rose more than 16 per cent since 2016,
even as rates of other violent crime decreased or remained steady. Nearly 400 of
the 1,431 reported assaults over the past three-years came from the central
business district, which includes the Granville strip and other nightlife areas1;
9. The City of Vancouver has been concerned in the past with the high rate of crime
and sexual assault in the Granville Entertainment District;

11. The City of Vancouver has invested greatly in developing a Nighttime Economy,
including passing a recent motion to create “A Comprehensive Strategy for
Realizing the Full Potential of the Nighttime Economy in the City of Vancouver”.
This work includes keeping the safety of the local workforce in mind, particularly
as women constitute a majority of workers in hotels, restaurants and bars and
commonly experience sexual harassment in these industries;
12. Attracting greater numbers of tourists and local residents to our downtown social
district can yield greater nightlife vibrancy and economic growth, and it can place
demands on public safety and create additional risks for vulnerable people,
including service and hospitality staff.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Vancouver City Council direct staff to report to
Council on recommendations and actions to ensure the safety of women working in the
service and hospitality industry, with a specific focus on the Granville Entertainment
District and Vancouver’s luxury hotels. In the development of this report Council direct
staff to:
i. Meet with downtown hotel/restaurant owners, related association, service
worker advocate groups (unions and community advocates) to formulate
recommendations on how to combat the growth of sexual violence in
Vancouver’s hospitality and service industries;
ii. Explore ways to end sexual violence in the city, including in Vancouver
hotels, restaurants and bars, as part of its work on the UN Women Safe
Cities work and the upcoming nighttime economy strategy;
iii. Report back with implications of and options for mandating sexualized
violence prevention training for hotel and restaurant staff as part of either
the liquor licence or business licence approval process;
iv. Report back on options for conducting audits of venues to ensure the staff
and environment minimize risk of sexual violence incidents; including
working toward a common policy for business operators that establishes
a best practices standard for conduct.

7. Eliminating Generators: Greening Vancouver’s Film and Food Truck Industries
MOVED by Councillor Carr
SECONDED by Councillor De Genova
WHEREAS
1. Vancouver is the eighth global city to launch a C40 Women4Climate Mentorship
Program, coordinated by our city’s Sustainability Department and ZebX (Zero
Emission Buildings Centre of Excellence) and focused on initiatives that achieve
measurable reductions in local carbon pollution. One of our program participants
is Clara George, an award-winning Vancouver-based television and film
producer, whose short-term goal is to reduce carbon emissions generated by the
film industry through their use of diesel generators, with the long-term goal of
Vancouver becoming the most sustainable film production centre in the world,
with a blueprint that all filming centres can follow;
2. The Vancouver Economic Commission
(http://www.vancouvereconomic.com/film-television/) notes that Vancouver is the
third largest film and television production centre in North America, home to
approximately 65+ movies and 55+ TV series annually as well as hundreds of
other filming days for commercials, TV pilots and other features (407 productions
in 2016), generating 20,000 film and TV jobs in Vancouver, with a 2017 direct
spend in British Columbia of $3.8 billion including a payroll of $2.06 billion;
3. Vancouver’s supply of electricity is from BC Hydro, almost 97% of which is
generated from renewable energy—a clean, green source of power compared to
the diesel generators used by the film industry;
4. In 2018 there were an estimated 2,350 filming days in Vancouver, with each
filming day using at least one, and an average of 2-3 diesel generators. Each
generator uses, on average, 296 litres of diesel per filming day. Replacing diesel
generators with electrical plug-ins and other zero emissions options means a
potential reduction of 2,086,800 litres of diesel and their associated greenhouse
gas (GHG) emissions—about 5,500 tonnes of CO2e per year;

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, July 23, 2019 43
5. The City of Vancouver’s Greenest City Action Plan 2015-2020 and Renewable
City plan aim to reduce Vancouver’s GHG emissions by 50 percent from a 2007
baseline of 2,805,000 tCO2e by 2030 and eliminate dependence on fossil fuels
before 2050. These goals were strengthened by a unanimous vote of Council on
in January 2019 on the motion Ramping Up Vancouver’s Climate Action in
Response to the Climate Emergency;
6. Much of the filming activity and use of generators is concentrated around clusters
of prime filming locations and “on location” parking lots, many of which are on or
near city properties, and some of which are on School Board and Park Board
properties;
7. Diesel generators can be replaced through tie-ins to city buildings or the use of
electricity power drops, which can also be used as EV charging stations;
8. Reducing and replacing the use of diesel generators in the film industry would
not only help achieve the city’s climate action and GHG reduction objectives, but
would also contribute to a healthier and quieter city by reducing diesel
particulates and noise pollution;
9. Considering the film industry’s savings on reduced use of diesel fuel and their
desire to “green” their industry, the industry could help finance electricity power
drops and building tie-ins;
10. The City of Vancouver issues approximately 150 food truck permits annually.
Approximately 87 foot trucks use generators. The elimination of the generators
used by the food truck industry could save about 1,100 tonnes of CO2e per year.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT City Council direct staff to work with the film
industry to develop a plan that quickly reduces and aims to completely eliminate the use
of generators for filming and food trucks in Vancouver. Components of the plan should
include:
1. Identifying opportunities and challenges to obtaining electrical power to
needed areas;
2. Prioritizing high use filming locations for electricity power drops and
building tie-ins;
3. Coordinating with the City’s Electric Vehicle Ecosystem Strategy and
REFM (Real Estate and Facilities Management) Planning to assess
potential locations that can also be used as EV charging stations and for
events, street festivals, food trucks and other activities that currently use
diesel generators;
4. Establishing actions and time-lines that facilitate the city meeting its GHG
reduction goals;
5. Identifying and pursuing policies around street closures that will reduce
the number of diesel generators needed for filming;
6. Working with the Vancouver Park Board to participate in this plan;
7. Encouraging the Vancouver School Board to develop a similar plan;

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, July 23, 2019 44
8. Developing a financing plan that leverages new revenue opportunities
from the film industry and possibly from low carbon fuel standard credits
for the reductions in GHG emissions;
9. Identifying any City by-laws and/or policies that may need to be updated
to accommodate the supply of electrical power by the City to the needed
areas;
10. Work with the film industry to determine what actions would be required to
authentically brand Vancouver as the Greenest Film Production Centre in
the World, and include GHGs, waste, noise and water use on production
sites and report back to Council in 2020 on the outcomes;
11. That staff pursue opportunities to reduce reliance on generators for
curbside power uses, specifically food trucks and special events, and
report back on actions and a timeline to align with the aim of eliminating
reliance on generators.

8. Future of Balmoral and Regent Hotels
MOVED by Councillor Swanson
SECONDED by Councillor Boyle
WHEREAS
1. In July 2018, the City of Vancouver began the process to expropriate two
Downtown Eastside Single Room Occupancy (SRO) Hotels – the Regent and the
Balmoral – that housed very low-income residents for decades;
2. Three hundred and twenty-four rooms at the Regent and Balmoral Hotels remain
vacant;
3. The 2019 homeless count is the highest in Vancouver history with about 1370
homeless (62%) in the Downtown Eastside;

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, July 23, 2019 45
4. The incomes of the residents in Downtown Eastside are extremely low; many of
them do not feel comfortable in other Vancouver neighbourhoods and prefers the
Downtown Eastside as their community of choice.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT the City of Vancouver ask the Province and Federal Governments for
partnership and financial support in developing the future of these two sites
(Balmoral and Regent Hotels) for low income, indigenous and women community
residents.
B. THAT if the buildings (Balmoral and Regent Hotels) are acquired by the City of
Vancouver, the City staff consult with low income, indigenous and women

10. Historical Discrimination Against People of South Asian Descent in Vancouver
MOVED by Councillor Boyle
SECONDED by Councillor De Genova
WHEREAS
1. The City of Vancouver strives to be an advocate for racial and cultural equity;
2. The history of Vancouver includes discrimination against people of South Asian
Descent;
3. The City of Vancouver has an obligation to facilitate and promote cultural,
emotional and material redress for historic wrongdoing;
4. The South Asian community in Vancouver is diverse in terms of its religions,
ethnicities, identities and languages; and is growing. The South Asian community
is the second largest visible minority group in the City and is projected to make
up the largest visible minority group in Canada within the next two decades;
5. The first wave of South Asian immigration to Vancouver occurred in the 1890s. In
1907, all people from India not of Anglo-Saxon parentage were denied the right
to vote in BC and later, throughout Canada, despite citizens of India being British
subjects;
6. An amendment to the B.C. Elections Act was made to have South Asians added
to other “Asian undesirables.” This meant South Asians were denied municipal
and provincial contracts. They were denied professions in education, law, and
pharmacy. They could not own property in Vancouver. They experienced racial
stereotyping and physical abuse. They were denied their rights to cultural and
religious expression, including being unable to attend a public cinema while
wearing traditional headdresses1;
7. Despite many historic and ongoing injustices and the continuing impacts of
institutionalized racism, in 1947, South Asians were given the right to vote
federally and provincially and were eligible to apply for Canadian citizenship. In
1948, South Asians were given the right to vote in municipal elections;
8. In May, 2016, the Right Honourable Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada
formally apologized in the House of Commons for the Canadian government’s
action in denying the Komagata Maru from docking on the shores of Canada in
1914. The ship carried 376 passengers of Sikh, Muslim, and Hindu faith who
were seeking a better life in Canada. The Prime Minister also formally apologized
for the subsequent exclusion of immigration of people of South Asian descent;

Minutes, July 23, 2019 47
9. In May, 2008, the British Columbia Legislature offered an official apology for the
treatment of South Asian passengers aboard the Komagata Maru after they were
denied entry to Canada in 1914;
10. In April, 2018, the City of Vancouver officially apologized for the City’s role in
institutionalizing racism against citizens of Chinese descent and offered a
recommendation report on how to move forward from these wrongdoings. The
apology acknowledged the wrongdoings of past legislation, regulations, and
policies of previous Vancouver City Councils;
11. In May 2019, Vancouver’s current City Council passed the motion, Punjabi
Market at Fifty: Celebrating the Past and Planning for the Future, which affirmed
that the Punjabi Market shopping area is an area with historical significance and
present day importance;
12. In March 2019, Vancouver’s current City Council showed its support for naming a
civic asset in the Downtown near the Burrard Inlet after the Komogata Maru;
13. The City’s apology and the implementation of the recommendations of the CoV
report “Preliminary Research on Historical Discriminaiton Against Chinese
People in Vancouver”, is resulting in positive, inclusionary societal changes in the
City of Vancouver;
14. The South Asian community, as targets of historic and ongoing discrimination
and institutionalized racism, would value an initiative similar to which was offered
to Vancouver’s Chinese community;
15. Such an initiative would benefit the City of Vancouver by encouraging diverse,
safe, healthy and respectful communities;
16. Vancouver City Council is considering launching a City Wide Planning Process,
where prior, City Council has expressed key goals and objectives to guide a
city-wide planning effort, which includes:
a. Maintaining Vancouver as a diverse and inclusive community;
b. Enhancing social well-being;
17. In June 2019, Vancouver City Council voted unanimously in favour of supporting
efforts to revitalize Vancouver’s Punjabi Market district (North America’s oldest
South Asian market). Moving towards reconciliation and a public apology to the
South Asian community would promote and celebrate the inclusion, belonging
and resiliency of the South Asian community.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to develop a report on
historical discrimination against the South Asian community in Vancouver. In doing so
staff should:
i. Engage directly and work collaboratively with the South Asian Community
in Vancouver, including but not limited to academics, historians, artists,

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, July 23, 2019 48
professionals, business and community leaders, and community
organizations;
ii. Provide a summary of laws, regulations and policies of previous
Vancouver City Councils that discriminated against the people of South
Asian descent in the City of Vancouver from the late 1890s to the present;
iii. Report back to Council with recommendations on steps and actions in
support of reconciliation, including changes to resources and policies to
acknowledge any of these wrongdoings, and also including plans for a
public acknowledgement and formal apology to the South Asian
community;
iv. Prepare a proposed scope of work, budget, and timeline in Fall 2019 to
ensure consideration in the 2020 budget process;
v. Include recommended actions City Council could take or announce in
tandem with the 50th anniversary of Vancouver’s Punjabi Market on
May 31, 2020;
FURTHER THAT Council directs staff to connect this work to the development and
implementation of the City-wide Plan.

11. Deterring and Preventing the Distribution and Sale of Psilocybin Mushrooms
and/or Other Illicit or Controlled Drugs Unlawfully Sold in the City of Vancouver
MOVED by Councillor De Genova
SECONDED by Councillor Dominato
WHEREAS
1. The Controlled Drugs and Substances Act categorizes Psilocin (3–[2–
(dimethylamino)ethyl]–4–hydroxyindole) and any salt thereof AND
Psilocybin (3–[2–(dimethylamino)ethyl]–4–phosphoryloxyindole) and any
salt thereof;
2. “Dirty Money” the report authored by Dr. Peter German Q.C., commissioned by
the provincial government states “The most lucrative crimes in Vancouver are
related to illegal drug sales. The drugs of choice cover the spectrum, from natural
products such as cannabis, cocaine and heroin, to chemical creations such as
opioids and hallucinogens. The purchasers are everyday residents of Vancouver
and are of every ethnicity, cultural heritage and gender.” (Page 37, section 122);
3. Dr. German also states in the “Dirty Money” report “Police sources indicate that
large quantities of illicit drug money also transit through Vancouver and are
related to Mexican drug cartels, including the Sinaloa and the CJNG.
Furthermore, Middle East Organized Crime (MEOC) is believed to have a strong
foothold in Vancouver and be working in concert with Mexican cartels. Fifteen
local crime groups provide transportation and other support services. The
involvement of home grown outlaw biker gangs in the illegal drug trade has been
documented for decades.”(Page 37, section 123);
4. In 2015, the City of Vancouver implemented amendments to the Zoning
by-laws to allow for Medical Marijuana Related Use (MMRU). Although
many dispensaries and compassion clubs applied and were successful in
obtaining Development Permits and opening dispensaries, no information
on the source of supply for these drugs was required. When the by-law
passed, federal law prohibited the sale of cannabis by dispensaries;
5. The City of Vancouver had difficulty with enforcement for dispensaries
that violated the conditions of the MMRU. Many dispensaries and stores
operated without a license, refusing to shut down;
6. Further, the dispensaries can only acquire their marijuana from illegal
sources. The Medicinal Mushroom Dispensary website states “We
provide micro doses of psilocybin mushrooms for medicinal purposes.”
The website goes on to state under the category of “Location” Serving all
of Canada by Mail Order. We will be opening a store front in Vancouver
soon;
7. Psilocybin and psilocin compounds, and other substances included in the
Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA) are being studied for

potential to treat a variety of medical and psychological conditions, and
any health benefits are unsubstantiated. The Health Canada website
titled “Psilocybin and psilocin (“Magic Mushrooms”)” cautions “It is
important to note that these studies administered purified active
ingredients, i.e. psilocybin, in clinically supervised settings. Currently
there are no approved therapeutic products containing psilocybin in
Canada”;
8. Listed on the government of Canada website, Problematic Substance
Use and Controlled and Illegal Drugs webpage, information states:
“Magic mushrooms may be sold as either dried whole mushrooms or as a
powder. People may choose to take the mushrooms as: eaten raw or
cooked, drunk as a tea or as a mixture with a fruit juice, sniffed up the
nose (snorted) when in a powder.
Psilocybin and psilocin can also be sold as a powder or in tablets or
capsules and can be produced in illegal labs. These active ingredients,
psilocybin and psilocin, can also be injected intravenously. The content of
the drugs from illegal labs is not tested and may contain other dangerous
substances.”;
9. A report to the Vancouver Police Board dated September 1, 2015 titled Service
and Policy Complaint #2015-112 regarding enforcement against states:
“Marihuana dispensaries are illegal; however, the issue of enforcement against
marihuana dispensaries is a complicated one because of intersecting legal,
social and political factors. The City of Vancouver (“the City”) has decided to
regulate rather than close all marijuana dispensaries using its by-law powers.”
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to engage and work
with the Vancouver Police Department, Vancouver Coastal Health and
appropriate stakeholders to address businesses and or dispensaries participating
in the unlawful sale and/or distribution of substances protected by the Controlled
Substances and Drug Act (CSDA), and report back with possible
recommendations to Council, by the end of 2019, including consideration for:
i. Any impact to public safety, including the City of Vancouver’s commitment
to deterring and preventing money laundering and criminal activity;
ii. Public health, including the impact and consequences of businesses
promoting unsubstantiated health benefits of potentially harmful
substances;
