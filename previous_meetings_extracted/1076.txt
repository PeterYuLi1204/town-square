Court of Revision
Minutes, Tuesday, February 20, 2018 2
Staff from the Business Improvement Area Program advised that no correspondence had been
received regarding errors or omissions in the names of assessed property owners, or the
length of the frontage or other measurements of the parcels, but advised Council of an error
regarding the attachment for a) Cambie Village Business Improvement Area Renewal, noting it
should have been a copy of the Special Assessment Letter sent to property owners rather than
a copy of the generic property-owner notification letter for the proposed Cambie Village
Expansion Area. This does not affect the notification process, as the correct letters were
originally sent to the property owners in question.
The Mayor called for speakers relating only to the above-noted errors or omissions, and none
were present.
ADJOURNMENT
MOVED by Councillor Deal
SECONDED by Councillor Jang
