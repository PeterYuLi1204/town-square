MOVED by Mayor Stewart
SECONDED by Councillor Swanson
WHEREAS
1. People and organizations around the world and in Vancouver (including the
British Columbia Civil Liberties Association, Union of British Columbia Indian
Chiefs, Black Lives Matter Vancouver, and the Hogan’s Alley Society) are calling
for reforms to how police services are delivered, including ending street checks -
the practice of stopping a person outside of an investigation, and often obtaining
and recording their personal information;
2. Data released by the Vancouver Police Department in 2018 showed almost
100,000 street checks were conducted by the VPD between 2008 and 2017, with

Council Meeting
Minutes, July 21, 23 and 24, 2020 7
Indigenous and Black people being significantly overrepresented in these checks
compared to their proportion of the population;
3. Following the implementation of new provincial guidelines in January 2020, VPD
has reported a 91% reduction in street checks;
4. The Vancouver Police Board has recently committed to new actions to improve
policing services including: establishing a new Black and African Diaspora
Advisory Committee, providing historical awareness and cultural sensitivity
training for current and future officers regarding the experiences of Black people,
participating in anti-bias and cultural sensitivity training, working with the existing
Indigenous Advisory Committee to improve training for current and future officers
regarding Indigenous Peoples cultural sensitivity, enhancing communication
between the Board, Vancouver City Council, and the Musqueam regarding the
provision of policing services in Vancouver, and, reviewing the efficacy of the
new street check policy;
5. Police Act Section 26 states “In consultation with the chief constable, the
municipal police board must determine the priorities, goals and objectives of the
municipal police department” and that “in determining the priorities, goals and
objectives of the municipal police department, the municipal police board must
take into account….the priorities, goals and objectives of the council of the
municipality”;
6. The Vancouver Police Board has the authority to end the practice of street
checks in Vancouver; and
7. While Police Act Section 25 states the Mayor of Vancouver chairs the Vancouver
Police Board in an ex-officio capacity without the ability to vote on Police Board
matters except in the event of a tie and cannot move board motions.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct the Mayor to write to the
Vancouver Police Board to inform the Board that while Council deeply appreciates
recent efforts to reform policing services and the efforts of the Police Department to
quickly implement related changes, Vancouver City Council’s priority is to end the
practice of street checks in Vancouver.

2. Retail Revolution: Bringing Digital Main Street to Vancouver to Support Brick and
Mortar Neighbourhood Small Business
MOVED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
SECONDED by Councillor Dominato
1. The COVID-19 pandemic has inflicted significant negative economic impact with
many Vancouver businesses forced to close or severely limit operations due to
health and physical distancing restrictions;
2. According to Statistics Canada, retail sales fell 26.4 percent to $34.7 billion in
April from March, leaving them down 33.6 percent since physical distancing
measures were implemented in mid-March. StatsCan says about one-third of
retailers were closed because of the pandemic. On average, economists had
expected a lower drop in April of 15.1 percent according to financial markets data
firm Refinitiv;
3. While essential services like grocery stores remained open, most retailers did not
offer in-store shopping in April due to public health restrictions. Online sales

Council Meeting
Minutes, July 21, 23 and 24, 2020 37
surged to a record high, representing 9.5 percent of the total retail market. Many
businesses started or expanded their online presence and curbside pick-up
services in response to closures. However, many small businesses have not had
the knowledge or resources to effectively expand online;
4. Vancouver has many retail-commercial districts across the city, with 22 Business
Improvement Areas (BIAs) and roughly 15,000 small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs) within them;
5. 98 percent of Vancouver businesses are SMEs with fewer than 50 employees.
These businesses have a significant impact on Vancouver’s local economy
generating significant jobs and tax revenue. 34 percent of Provincial Gross
Domestic Product is attributable to the small business sector;
6. BIAs across Vancouver cited that up to 90% of businesses in their districts
closed – either voluntarily or due to mandatory orders – since the implementation
of restrictions to support physical distancing. Many businesses are now
reopening and struggling to adapt to the ‘new normal’;
7. Despite the easing of restrictions, small business and retail survival post-COVID-
19 is uncertain due to continued health restrictions, increased safety and
sanitation costs, economic recession, diminished consumer confidence, and
increased preference and adaptation to the convenience and safety of shopping
online;
8. A recent survey conducted by the BC Chamber of Commerce of 8,000
businesses in BC, showed 73 percent of businesses expect their revenues will
drop by 50 percent or more, with nearly a quarter saying revenues will drop by
100 percent, as a result of current restrictions;
9. Permanent closure of storefronts in Vancouver would have significant negative
impact on local employment and the vibrancy of neighbourhoods diminishing
complete communities, local feel, and social connection;
10. Digital Main Street (DMS) was developed to support small ‘bricks and mortar’
businesses to be more competitive in online retail through digital transformation.
DMS assists small businesses with building online presence and sales capacity
through online resources and training and one-on-one coaching;
11. Digital Main Street was created by the City of Toronto and the Toronto
Association of Business Improvement Areas (TABIA) in 2016. Funding from the
Province of Ontario followed shortly after;
12. Small business retailers and operators still face high rents while struggling with
lower customer counts. Online commerce and initiatives like DMS to augment
physical location sales will be key to small business survival;

Council Meeting
Minutes, July 21, 23 and 24, 2020 38
13. The idea of bringing DMS to Vancouver and to BC led by Small Business BC is
supported by the Vancouver BIA Partnership, BIA BC as well as the Vancouver
Economic Commission and City staff;
14. Vancouver City Council and the City have a key role to play in championing and
supporting economic recovery;
15. Initiatives like room to queue and room to load that have been implemented as a
pandemic response, should be examined as a means to support a new type of
retail anticipating increased pickup activity for orders placed online;
16. If Vancouver loses our small business, we lose the strength of our local
economy. A LOCO BC survey found that spending at a local business equals
4.6X more impact with $63 of every $100 recirculating back into the local
economy vs $14 from spending at multinationals; and
17. With many small businesses on the verge of collapse, online commerce will help
the sector survive, recover and create economic resilience for future crises. DMS
is one great initiative that will need to be rolled into a larger recalibration that
recognizes the wholesale shift in retail. Supports needed for our main streets
span from taxation changes to placemaking and adjacent housing.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT the Mayor on behalf of Council write to the
Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages and the Minister of Small
Business, Export Promotion for the Government of Canada and the Minister of Jobs,
Economic Development and Competitiveness for the Province of BC stating Council’s
support for bringing the Digital Main Street Program to Vancouver and to BC, and for
Small Business BC to lead this initiative working in collaboration with Business
Improvement Associations;
FURTHER THAT the above-mentioned letter be shared with Small Business BC, the
Vancouver BIA Partnership, BIA BC and the Vancouver Economic Commission.

3. Decriminalizing Poverty and Supporting Community-led Safety Initiatives
MOVED by Councillor Swanson
SECONDED by Councillor Boyle
WHEREAS
1. Officers in the Vancouver Police Department routinely respond to calls that are
related to social issues, including addiction, substance use, homelessness,
mental health issues, and poverty;
2. Officers in the Vancouver Police Department continue to respond to mental
health calls, reporting that they responded to more than 5,000 calls related to
mental health in 2019 alone;
3. The police budget for the Vancouver Police Department has grown more than
$100 million over the last 10 years;
4. There is widespread recognition that police officers are routinely attending to
calls that would be better dealt with by peer-, health-, social- and community-
based programming. Evidence suggests that criminalization and policing are not
effective solutions or harm reduction strategies for these concerns. This evidence
includes local communities, organizations, and residents who have called and
are calling for support for existing and future alternative approaches;
5. A number of reports have made recommendations regarding the criminalization
of Indigenous people, people who rely on public space, and people who use illicit
substances, including Red Women Rising (Martin & Walia, 2019) and Project
Inclusion: Confronting Anti-Homeless and Anti-Substance User Stigma in British
Columbia (Bennett & Larkin, 2018);
6. Recommendations from Red Women Rising include:
a. Redirect growing municipal, provincial, and federal police and prison
budgets towards solutions that increase safety for Indigenous women
such as more housing, child care, income, healthcare, mental health and
addictions services, and healing supports;
b. Repeal laws that criminalize or increase harm for women in the sex trade;
c. All levels of government must commit to using non-incarceration

7. Current policing practices disproportionately criminalize Black and Indigenous
communities, as reflected in street check data, as well as rates of incarceration in
provincial and federal prisons;
8. The Truth & Reconciliation Commission of Canada Calls to Action (2015) calls
upon federal, provincial, and territorial governments to commit to the recognition
and implementation of Aboriginal justice systems in a manner consistent with the

On July 21, 2020, Councillor Kirby-Yung withdrew the above-noted motion.
5. Enabling Creative and Easily Replicated “Missing Middle” Housing Pilots
MOVED by Councillor Dominato
SECONDED by Councillor De Genova
WHEREAS
1. It is the Mission of the City of Vancouver to create a great city of communities
that cares about its people, the environment, and opportunities to live, work, and
prosper;
2. Among the six core values that guide the City’s Mission are the values of
“Responsiveness,” whereby the City is responsive to the needs of citizens and
our City colleagues, and “Excellence,” whereby we strive for the best results;
3. There is a significant equity problem and mismatch between our land use
regulations and our local incomes: roughly 60% of the City of Vancouver’s land
base is currently zoned RS-1 for single detached housing, a form of development
that is affordable to only roughly 5% of households based on Greater Vancouver
incomes;
4. The City of Vancouver uses community plans to provide clear but flexible
frameworks to guide positive change and development in neighbourhoods over a
period of approximately 20 – 30 years. Community plans are policy documents
that provide guidance and direction on a variety of topics, from land use and
urban design, to housing, transportation, and community facilities. A community
plan also recognizes aspects of the community valued by its citizens and
addresses the specific issues and initiatives of each community area. Each
community plan considers long-range and shorter-term goals, and works within
broader objectives established for the entire city and at regional and provincial
levels;
5. The 2012 Mayor’s Task Force on Housing Affordability co-chaired by Olga Ilich,
along with the Report from the Round table on Building Form and Design (the
Geller Report), pointed to the need to increase the supply of different types of
housing, particularly for families with children. The 2012 report recommended
identifying opportunities to add ground-oriented medium density housing forms

Council Meeting
Minutes, July 21, 23 and 24, 2020 42
such as townhouses, row houses or stacked townhouses in low-density
residential areas;
6. The Mayor’s Task Force on Housing Affordability report also encouraged the
creative use of underutilized city land, such as streets, to enable affordable,
ground-oriented medium density housing forms;
7. At the November 29, 2017, meeting of the Standing Committee of Council on
Policy and Strategic Priorities, the previous Council approved the Housing
Vancouver Strategy (2018 – 2027), including Appendices A and B of the
Administrative Report dated November 15, 2017, entitled “Housing Vancouver
Strategy (2018 - 2027) and 3-Year Action Plan (2018 - 2020)”, as the basis for
addressing Vancouver’s housing affordability crisis, with direction to staff to
proceed with next steps towards implementation;
8. A key objective of the Housing Vancouver Strategy is a shift toward the right
supply of housing to meet the needs of people who live and work in Vancouver.
To meet the right supply targets, the City is continually looking at new
opportunities to add housing choice across the city in low-density
neighbourhoods as a key building block of a future city-wide plan. The aim is to
deliver housing that falls into the “missing middle” between single-family homes
and higher density apartments;
9. The intent of the Housing Vancouver Strategy is to provide a strong foundation
for the future in Vancouver and for Vancouver to be a place where:
• Neighbourhoods are full of families;
• Young people can afford to buy a home; and
• People of all incomes and backgrounds can participate in their
communities;
10. In May 2018, City Staff embarked on a Regulation Redesign project to simplify
the City’s land use regulatory framework in order to improve permit processing –
consistent with a corporate priority in the City’s 2019 Corporate Plan (Goal 1C –
Excellent Service) and consistent with a key regulatory framework action item in
the Housing Vancouver strategy;
11. The key objectives of Regulation Redesign is to:
• simplify regulations;
• reconcile competing objectives;
• improve consistency between by-laws and policies;
• ensure land use policies and regulations advance City priorities; and
• improve external and internal communication;
12. At the June 20, 2018, meeting of the Standing Committee of Council on Policy on
Strategic Priorities, the previous Council endorsed a proposed program outlined
in the Making Room Housing Program presentation dated June 19, 2018 (Making

Council Meeting
Minutes, July 21, 23 and 24, 2020 43
Room Housing Program: Overview and Quick Start Actions, June 5, 2018). The
Making Room Housing Program was created to address a key objective of the
Housing Vancouver Strategy, namely, to add housing choice to neighbourhoods
across Vancouver;
13. Following the October 20, 2018, municipal election, the newly-elected Council
requested that staff focus planning efforts on initiating a City-wide Plan. As a
result, the Making Room Housing Program was transitioned from being an
independent planning program focused on adding housing choice to low density
neighbourhoods into a broader integrated planning effort to create complete
communities as part of the work of the City-wide Plan;
14. While the City of Vancouver has many plans and policies for communities,
housing, transportation, and infrastructure, the City currently does not have a
master plan that sets the direction for the entire city. The Vancouver Plan (i.e.,
City-wide Plan) is intended to help unify all of the City’s existing plans, and
prioritize future directions for the city we want to become, with an
acknowledgement that the choices we make today will have a large impact on
future generations and that without a clear vision, our daily decisions and policies
may not lead us in a direction that we, as a city, desire;
15. At the May 15, 2019, meeting of the Standing Committee on Policy and Strategic
Priorities, Council received a policy report from the General Manager of Planning,
Urban Design and Sustainability (stemming from the Regulation Redesign
project). The policy report recommended various regulatory amendments and the
repeal of outdated or superseded policy and guideline documents. The regulatory
changes were sought to help to update regulations, to make the Zoning and
Development By-law more user-friendly, and to improve clarity for staff and
applicants;
16. On November 14, 2019, City Staff embarked on the Vancouver Plan planning
and engagement process and began asking the public questions to better
understand the challenges and priorities of residents. To date, the listening
process has heard the hopes, concerns, and aspirations of over 10,000
residents, employees, business owners, and visitors as part of the initial phase.
The thoughts that have been gathered are considered to be valuable and will
guide the next phase of the Vancouver Plan process and conversations on “The
Future We Want.”;
17. At the March 11, 2020, meeting of the Standing Committee on Policy and
Strategic Priorities, Council received a update on Phase 1 of the Vancouver Plan
process. Background and context information was included in the Staff
presentation and the following points were noted as to why there is a need for a
plan and why now:
• It’s a moment in time for Vancouver;
• High level of public anxiety about present and future;
• The power of a unifying vision and action strategy;
• Leveraging regional alignment and partnerships;

Council Meeting
Minutes, July 21, 23 and 24, 2020 44
• Framework for better decision-making; and
• Reforming ongoing civic engagement and building trust;
18. The Vancouver Plan will ultimately set directions to guide the city’s future
priorities into 2050 and beyond, and the timeline to move from a plan to the
action phase is slated to take place between November 2021 and July 2022;
19. Due to the transitioning and subsuming of previous City planning processes into
the new Vancouver Plan process, the City’s existing Affordable Housing Choices
Interim Rezoning Policy (AHC IRP), which was established to encourage
innovation and enable real examples of ground-oriented and mid-rise affordable
housing types to be tested for potential wider application and provide ongoing
housing opportunities, has expired. New proposals for innovative housing are not
being accepted under the program at this time and opportunities are potentially
being missed as a result;
20. The ongoing need for innovation in the Vancouver housing market has never
been greater and has been a hallmark of Vancouver planning efforts going back
many decades. It has long been recognized that, if population growth and
demographic changes in the city are to be accommodated successfully,
developing various medium density forms that are economically viable and at the
same time can be successfully accommodated within, or adjacent to, single-
family neighbourhoods, is vitally important. Recognition of this fact is as evident
today as it was in decades past as can be seen in such City policies and plans as
CityPlan and the Neighbourhood Housing Demonstration Program from the
1990s; i https://council.vancouver.ca/previous_years/970225/a5.htm
21. The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed gaps in our housing framework and
presented opportunities to be bold in tackling much needed housing forms. The
Vancouver Plan has been refocused on recovery and short term recovery actions
are being pursued for 2020. These include a focus on complete neighbourhoods,
intergenerational living and affordable housing; and
22. Given the urgent need to shift toward the right supply of housing in the City that
can meet the needs of the people who live and work in Vancouver, and meeting
the right supply targets for that housing, it is imperative that the City continue to
identify opportunities to add innovative new housing choice across the City in our
lower-density neighbourhoods as a key building block of a future citywide plan.
Council’s ongoing aim should be to address the housing shortage identified as
the “missing middle”, as it relates to a middle income rental housing and
affordable home ownership, as an ongoing priority as we work toward a
comprehensive City-wide Vancouver Plan.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to report back in Q4 2020
with short term recovery actions to enable creative and experimental ground-oriented
housing types in RS and RT zones that:
• are suitable and affordable for a wider spectrum of Vancouver families;
• that can be easily replicated on a wider scale throughout the city, and

Council Meeting
Minutes, July 21, 23 and 24, 2020 45
• which would inherently complement and/or dovetail with the core objectives of a
new City-wide Vancouver Plan;
so as not to lose out on innovative housing opportunities that could be lost due to the
lack of a working policy, while the City and staff work toward the realization of a
comprehensive Vancouver Plan;
FURTHER THAT any recommended short term recovery actions consider pilots on city
owned and private land, consider rental and freehold tenure, incentives, and relaxations
in height, density and parking for creative infill and ground oriented proposals that
significantly widen the spectrum of housing affordability in these areas by increasing the
intensity of land use whilst preserving good design and livability characteristic of
Vancouver neighbourhoods;
AND FURTHER THAT Council direct staff to report back Q2 2021 on options for a
revised policy framework that would enable additional density for housing options along
arterials and transit hubs and would serve the needs of moderate income households,
delivering more units than the current Moderate Income Rental Housing Pilot Program
(MIRHPP).

ENQUIRIES AND OTHER MATTERS
1. Secured Rental Policy Consultation Deadline
Councillor Carr enquired about the secured rental policy that is currently under consultation by
the City with an end date of August 9 and with the unique circumstances of this summer,
wondered if the end date could get pushed back into the fall. The City Manager advised to
follow up with an answer via email to all of Council, after consulting with staff.
2. Update on Member Motion entitled “Discriminatory Covenants, Language and
Encumbrances on Vancouver Land Titles”
Councillor Kirby-Yung requested an update on the Member Motion entitled “Discriminatory
Covenants, Language and Encumbrances on Vancouver Land Titles”, approved at the Council
meeting on February 25, 2020. The City Manager advised to provide Council with an update on
this Member Motion, after consulting with staff.
3. Update on the Current Encampment Situation in Strathcona
Councillor Kirby-Yung requested an update on the efforts being made by the City and the
Province in order to address the recent emails received from residents and business owners in
Strathcona around safety concerns due to the current encampment in the area and the
challenges faced by the homeless residents. The Mayor advised that conversations have been
ongoing with the Province on this topic, particularly with Minister Shane Simpson, Minister of
Social Development and Poverty Reduction, and with Minister Selina Robinson, Minister of
Municipal Affairs and Housing, and the solution would be to have more housing on an
immediate basis. The Mayor noted that the Province just announced the purchase of three
hotels in the Strathcona area, and more announcements will be coming in the future. Also, the
Mayor advised that this conversation will be moving forward to the Prime Minister’s Office in
order to request the fulfilment of the initial commitment to bring temporary modular housing to
the city. The Mayor noted his goal would be to have safe housing for all the people currently
encamped in Strathcona Park and to work together with the Vancouver Police Department and
the service agencies to ensure the safety of people living in the neighbourhood and in the park.
The City Manager advised that City staff is engaging with BC Housing in providing support to
the members of the public having to camp in this area and will continue to coordinate through

Council Meeting

the Mayor’s Office.
4. Update on Housing Support for Residents of Downtown-South
Councillor Kirby-Yung enquired about the status of the two hotels recently purchased by the City
in the Downtown-South area, and if there are any updates on community discussions of housing
agreements to support the residents in this area. The Mayor noted he is having ongoing
conversations with Minister Shane Simpson, Minister of Social Development and Poverty
Reduction, and also advised that he recently attended a meeting called by two local BIAs,
attended by Adam Palmer, Chief Constable, Vancouver Police Department, and the City
Manager, further discussing this topic. The Mayor is seeking the Province’s support and
resources to help in the transition of the two hotels and is hopeful it can be managed in a way
that will lessen the impact on the community. The City Manager also advised about the
communication between the City, the Province and BC Housing. The City Manager also noted
that the City has drastically increased the cleaning protocols in that area and continue to work
closely with BC Housing and Vancouver Coastal Health to support the new residents of those
buildings and to make sure support is easily available.
5. Safety Concerns in Strathcona Park
Councillor Fry furthered enquired on the Strathcona Park encampment, and noted his concern
on possible future altercations as a result of illicit activities taking place in the park and would
want an update on any actions being taken by the City to prevent these “chop shops” and to
keep the public safe. Also, Councillor Fry requested an update on the Park Board’s By-laws for
overnight camping and permanent structures in parks. The City Manager noted that this is in the
Park Board’s jurisdiction and that City staff are working closely in supporting Park Board staff in
delivering the intentions of the Park Board Commissioners. The City Manager noted that staff
share similar concerns and the City has issued a Fire Chief’s Order and will continue to work
closely with the Park Board on how to best take care of this situation. The City Manager also
confirmed that the City’s Housing Outreach staff are not welcome in the park and are unable to
offer support to the people residing in the park. The City Manager will liaise with the Vancouver
Police Department in providing Council with an update on the measures taking place to mitigate
the crime arising due to the chop shops in the park.
6. Update on Navigation Centres
Councillor Dominato enquired if there have been any updates from the Province with respect to
the two Navigation Centres announced in February and their future locations. The Mayor noted
that he will have the Mayor’s Office staff check in on this enquiry. The City Manager noted that
there is an opportunity to have one Navigation Centre in Vancouver and one somewhere else in
the province, and that the City has been working closely on a proposal together with BC
Housing on the potential Navigation Centre in Vancouver. The City Manager also noted that the
City has been in contact with Street-to-Home Foundation to see if they will join in on the
partnership.
