4. Call for a Public Inquiry into Money Laundering in B.C. and Impacts on Vancouver
Real Estate and the Overdose Crisis
At the Regular Council meeting on February 12, 2019, Vancouver City Council referred this item
to the Standing Committee on City Finance and Services meeting on February 13, 2019, in
order to hear from speakers.
The Committee heard from one speaker in support of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Boyle
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. Peter German’s ‘Dirty Money’ report commissioned by B.C.’s Attorney General,
revealed significant money laundering taking place in Lower Mainland casinos,
estimating over $1 million has been laundered in B.C.;
2. The work of local investigative journalists, including findings from an RCMP
study, has revealed links between money laundering, fentanyl distribution, and
Vancouver real estate. These reports estimate that over $1 billion could have
been laundered through Vancouver homes;
3. The Provincial Government continues to investigate these links, through an
Expert Panel on Money Laundering, an anonymous tip portal, and a second
study by Peter German to be completed in March 2019;
4. Vancouver City Council passed a motion on January 29, 2019, submitted by
Councillor De Genova, on Deterring and Preventing Money Laundering and the
Business of Organized Crime in the City of Vancouver. That motion included that:
a. Page 16 of the Dirty Money Report, recommendation “R45” suggests
“That the Province undertake research into allegations of organized crime
penetration of the real estate industry”;

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, February 13, 2019 8
b. In “Dirty Money” Mr. German states “79. Part 2 overviews the
phenomenon of transnational organized crime and the unique position in
which Vancouver finds itself. It describes the ‘Vancouver Model’, which
provides a very practical framework for what has occurred in recent
years. A primer is included on money laundering”;
c. Mr. German also states in his report the most lucrative crimes in
Vancouver are related to illegal drug sales. The drugs of choice cover the
spectrum, from natural products such as cannabis, cocaine and heroin, to
chemical creations such as opioids and hallucinogens;
5. As of December 16, 2018, an estimated 353 overdose deaths have occurred in
Vancouver in 2018, which is almost on par with the 369 overdose deaths that
occurred in 2017, despite the extensive harm reduction investments in
Vancouver. Vancouver continues to have the highest rates of death per capita in
BC, with 58 deaths per 100,000 people this year, and Vancouver continues to be
the most impacted city of the overdose crisis in Canada;
6. Vancouver’s housing affordability crisis has skyrocketed over recent years. Data
from the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver shows that the average price
of a single-family detached home in Greater Vancouver increased as much in
2016 as it did from 1981 to 2005. Local housing costs far exceed local incomes,
and the gap between housing costs and local incomes increased sharply
between 2011 and 2016;
7. Charbonneau Commission deputy chief prosecutor Simon Tremblay has stated
that an inquiry could exist side-by-side with any other investigation in B.C., as
happened in Quebec. Meaning that existing investigations needn't be a barrier to
beginning a larger Public Inquiry; and
8. British Columbians are in favour of a public inquiry into money laundering. A
Research Co. poll last August showed that three-in-four residents (76%) believe
the provincial government should “definitely” or “probably” call a public inquiry.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council endorse a call for the Provincial Government to launch a Public
Inquiry into money laundering in B.C., similar to the Charbonneau Inquiry in
Quebec, to begin after Peter German’s review of money-laundering in B.C. real
estate, due in March 2019.
B. THAT the Mayor write a letter to the Premier, the Minister of Finance, and the
Attorney General, communicating Vancouver’s support for a Public Inquiry.
C. THAT Council request the terms of reference for this Public Inquiry include:
i. Investigation into money laundering in Vancouver real estate that may
have deepened the city’s housing affordability crisis;

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, February 13, 2019 9
ii. Investigation into links between organized crime, money laundering, and
the overdose crisis, which resulted in the deaths of nearly 1500 people
across BC in 2018, including an estimated 353 people in Vancouver.
amended
* * * * *
At 4:50 pm, Councillor De Genova relinquished the Chair to participate in debate. Councillor Fry
assumed the Chair.
* * * * *
AMENDMENT MOVED by Councillor De Genova
THAT A, B and C be struck and the following inserted:
A. THAT Council postpone the motion entitled “Call for a Public Inquiry into
Money Laundering in B.C. and Impacts on Vancouver Real Estate and
the Overdose Crisis”, as presented at the Standing Committee on City
Finance and Services meeting on February 13, 2019, and bring it back on
the agenda of the first Council meeting after Peter German presents to
Vancouver City Council;
FURTHER THAT that the motion be considered by Council at the first
meeting in Q3 2019, if Peter German’s presentation does not take place
before the end of Q2 2019.
B. THAT Council request staff, at the discretion of the City Manager, to
provide updates to the Province of British Columbia and specifically the
Attorney General’s Office with any information or new policy or policies,
as a result of the City of Vancouver’s efforts to deter and prevent money
laundering in the city of Vancouver.
C. THAT Council direct staff to provide information to Council on the two
reports, commissioned by the Province of British Columbia, to address
money laundering when both reports are complete;
FURTHER THAT staff consider any specific findings and/or
recommendations relevant to the City of Vancouver.
D. THAT Council affirm support for the Province of British Columbia and the
Attorney General to investigate, deter and prevent money laundering in
British Columbia;
FURTHER THAT if any decision is made by the Province of British
Columbia to launch a public inquiry into money laundering, Council
consider supporting this position.
