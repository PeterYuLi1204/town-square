(One-Family Dwelling) District to CD-1 (Comprehensive Development)
District, to permit the development of two four-storey residential buildings with

Council received a memorandum dated October 29, 2019, from Karen Hoese, Assistant Director

family housing requirement in Appendix A of the Policy Report dated September 17, 2019,
entitled “CD-1 Rezoning: 620-644 King Edward Avenue and 4111 Ash Street”. Instead of the
standard breakdown of 25% two-bedroom units and 10% three-bedroom units, the draft by-law
provisions contained in Appendix A only included an overall provision of 35% family housing
units.
The draft CD-1 By-law posted for the public hearing had been prepared to reflect the proper
family housing provision. There are no changes to the rezoning application, as it does meet the
family housing requirements of the Family Room: Housing Mix Policy for Rezoning Projects
Policy.
