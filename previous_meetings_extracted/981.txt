2. Confirmation of Regulatory Principles related to Ride-Hailing
January 7, 2019
The Committee heard from two speakers in support of the report who also recommended further
improvements, including the addition of a seventh regulatory principle of affordability.
MOVED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
THAT Council endorse the regulatory principles on passenger directed vehicles as
described in the Policy Report dated January 7, 2019, entitled “Confirmation of
Regulatory Principles related to Ride-Hailing”, and as set out below:
1. Regional coordination: Regulation is coordinated across the Metro Vancouver
region and can operate effectively within our regional context to achieve net-
positive sustainable transport goals for both the city and region.
2. Passenger safety: Companies, drivers and vehicles meet minimum safety
standards, and be held accountable for meeting them. Effective enforcement
mechanisms and sufficient resources should be in place to ensure compliance.
3. Enhanced accessibility: Ride-hailing companies should contribute to a system
that maintains or exceeds standards for accessibility and ensures sufficient
availability and maintenance of accessible vehicles.
4. Enhanced mobility: Ride-hailing is a complement to transit and active travel,
thereby advancing shared mobility and contributing to an efficient transportation
system including reducing congestion and overall reduced dependency on
private vehicle ownership. The following mechanisms support this:
a. Ride-hailing vehicles are subject to city by-laws regulating streets, traffic
and parking.
b. Municipalities are assured access to company/app data for traffic
management and policy and planning purposes.
c. The City (or region) is provided future opportunities for road user charges
(eg. a per-trip mobility fee) to best manage mobility outcomes to best
manage curbside demands, minimize congestion, ideally by time of day in
any problematic areas, and further incentives to pooled shared vehicles &
low emissions are enabled.
5. Reduced carbon emissions: Ride-hailing companies have ambitious programs
and ultimately targets that encourage drivers to use hybrid or zero emission
vehicles to be leaders in provincial climate change transition for all vehicles.
6. Economic Viability: The regulatory regime ensures opportunity for financial
viability of the existing taxi industry and new entrants to the market for passenger
directed vehicle services such as ride-hailing including non-profit organizations.

THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. The British Columbia government declared a provincial state of emergency in
2018 over record-setting wildfires:
a. Wildfires in BC broke the record for km2 burned in 2018, surpassing the
record of 12,161 km2 and 65,000 forced from their homes in 2017;
b. Wildfires in California killed more than 100 people and caused over
$14.5 billion in insured losses in 2018;
2. The Legislature of British Columbia and the House of Commons of Canada
acknowledged the growing crisis of climate breakdown by holding emergency
debates following the release of the October 2018, UN Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change (IPCC) report;
3. Local governments around the world are taking new actions to avoid the worst
impacts of climate breakdown and calling on senior levels of government for a
more urgent, emergency response;
4. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change finds that limiting global
warming to 1.5ºC with no or limited overshoot would imply global net CO
2
emissions dropping to between 50% and 58% below 2010 levels by 2030, and
between 94% and 107% below 2010 levels by 2050. Global net CO emissions
2
would need to continued to decline into the second half of the century reaching
negative net emissions in all scenarios;
5. The costs to Vancouver for dealing with sea level rise and stormwater and sewer
management are significant:
a. Staff estimate that approximately $1 billion of flood management
infrastructure is needed in Vancouver by 2100. To operate and maintain
this infrastructure, the City will require additional staff and budget
estimated at $5 million a year;
b. Conservative estimates of the cost of a flood in Vancouver place the
value in property and building damage at approximately $7 billion. This

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, January 16, 2019 8
does not include the economic impact of business disruption or the cost
of clean-up and rebuilding;
c. Regionally, the Fraser Basin Council, a non-profit group that provides
regional flood planning support, estimates the potential cost of a major
coastal flood at $25 billion for the Lower Mainland.
6. The world is currently on track for more than 3ºC of warming based on policies
currently in place, and those policies will need to be strengthened significantly to
limit warming to 1.5ºC. Vancouver, BC, and Canada are no exceptions:
a. Vancouver’s carbon pollution levels are 7% below 2007 levels, which
represents an average reduction of less than 1% per year over the past
decade. An average annual reduction of over 3% is necessary to meet
the City’s 2030 targets.
b. BC’s carbon pollution has increased in four of the past five years and the
province eliminated its 2020 reduction target because it was on track to
miss it by a wide margin. On December 5, 2018, the province introduced
a new climate change plan, which is expected to put the province on track
for 75% of its 2030 target of 40% below 2007 levels.
c. Canada’s carbon pollution was down 4% from 2005 levels to 704 million
tonnes. Policies committed to in the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean
Growth and Climate Action are only forecast to bring emissions down to
583 million tonnes in 2030, failing to meet the national target of 517
million tonnes;
7. The City of Vancouver has been taking action on sustainability through its
Greenest City and Renewable City Action plans, setting a solid foundation for
ramping up ambition and action to meet the moral and scientific urgency of
climate change;
8. Past City of Vancouver staff reports acknowledge that “climate change shocks
and stresses do not affect all groups in our community equally. Frontline
communities, those that have been affected by systemic vulnerabilities and
inequities, are often at greater risk from the impacts of climate change and often
have the fewest resources to respond and adapt”;
9. A growing list of cities, districts and counties across the world representing over
15 million people collectively have recently declared or officially acknowledged
the existence of a global climate emergency, including Los Angeles, Oakland,
and most recently London, England.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council recognize the breakdown of the stable climate and sea level
under which human civilization developed constitutes an emergency for the City
of Vancouver;
FURTHER THAT Council direct staff to report back within 90 days on
opportunities to:

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, January 16, 2019 9
i. increase ambition and/or accelerate timelines for existing actions under
the Renewable City Action Plan and Climate Adaptation Strategy;
ii. add new actions to help the City achieve its targets;
iii. add new actions that would help reduce GHG emissions beyond the
scope of the City’s current climate targets.
iv. Incorporate into the City’s climate targets and actions the need to achieve
net zero carbon emissions before 2050 and net negative carbon
emissions in the second half of the century.
B. THAT Council direct staff to establish a remaining carbon budget for corporate
and community emissions commensurate with limiting warming to 1.5ºC and
report annually on the expenditure of the City of Vancouver’s remaining carbon
budget.
C. THAT Council direct staff to establish a “Climate and Equity” working group to
provide guidance and support for the City’s efforts to transition off of fossil fuels
in ways the priorities those most vulnerable to climate impacts and most in need
of support in transitioning to renewable energy.
amended
AMENDMENT MOVED by Councillor Carr
THAT the motion be amended to read as follows:
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council recognize that:
i. we are in a global state of climate emergency that constitutes a
crisis for Vancouver including costs related to more extreme
weather events, air quality deterioration and sea level rise;
ii. almost all governments have failed to meet targets to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions, including the City of Vancouver which
has only decreased emissions by 7 percent to date despite aiming
for a 33 percent reduction over 2007 levels by 2020;
iii. we have a responsibility to respond to the United Nations’
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) October 2018
call for all political leaders to take urgent action to keep average
global temperature rise to below 1.5 degrees C in order to avoid
catastrophic social, environmental and economic breakdown;
FURTHER THAT Council direct staff to report back within 90 days on
updating the city’s Greenest City and Renewable City Action Plans and
Climate Adaptation Strategy in order to:
i. increase targets and accelerate timelines for actions in line with
the IPCC call for 45 percent reductions in GHG emissions over
2010 levels by 2030, net zero emissions by 2050; and net
negative carbon emissions in the second half of the century;

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, January 16, 2019 10
ii. add new actions to help the City achieve its new reduction goals;
iii. create interim four-year targets and goals to reach new reduction
goals.
B. THAT Council direct staff to establish a remaining carbon budget for
corporate and community emissions commensurate with limiting warming
to 1.5ºC, re-evaluate how to best measure such emissions, and report
annually on the expenditure of the City of Vancouver’s remaining carbon
budget.
C. THAT Council direct staff to establish a “Climate and Equity” working

THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. The City of Vancouver has recognized and has demonstrated over the past years
its commitment to the health and well-being of its residents, and lack of
transportation is one of the most common reasons for missing medical
appointments and a significant barrier to social inclusion and labour market
inclusion for low income adults and youth;
2. The #AllOnBoard Campaign, concerned agencies in Vancouver and throughout
Metro Vancouver, and directly impacted youth and adult community members
have brought to the attention of the City of Vancouver the direct harm that is
brought to them through the bad credit ratings they develop due to fare evasion
ticketing. Those living below the poverty line have brought forward that they
cannot afford to pay the $173 fines received individually, or the resulting accrued
‘TransLink debt’ from many unpaid fines;

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, January 16, 2019 16
3. The City of Vancouver and other municipalities contribute to charities and
non-profits which then out of necessity subsidize transit tickets for those who
cannot afford to access crucial social services provided by the City of Vancouver
and other municipalities, and many pay off ‘TransLink debt’ and fare evasion
fines to TransLink and external collection agencies.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT the City of Vancouver endorse the #AllOnBoard Campaign; the City write a
letter to the TransLink Mayors’ Council on Regional Transportation, the Board of
Directors of TransLink, the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing and the

FINAL MOTION AS APPROVED
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. The City of Vancouver has recognized and has demonstrated over the past years
its commitment to the health and well-being of its residents, and lack of
transportation is one of the most common reasons for missing medical

Minutes, Wednesday, January 16, 2019 19
appointments and a significant barrier to social inclusion and labour market
inclusion for low income adults and youth;
2. The #AllOnBoard Campaign, concerned agencies in Vancouver and throughout
Metro Vancouver, and directly impacted youth and adult community members
have brought to the attention of the City of Vancouver the direct harm that is
brought to them through the bad credit ratings they develop due to fare evasion
ticketing. Those living below the poverty line have brought forward that they
cannot afford to pay the $173 fines received individually, or the resulting accrued
‘TransLink debt’ from many unpaid fines; and
3. The City of Vancouver and other municipalities contribute to charities and
non-profits which then out of necessity subsidize transit tickets for those who
cannot afford to access crucial social services provided by the City of Vancouver
and other municipalities, and many pay off ‘TransLink debt’ and fare evasion
fines to TransLink and external collection agencies.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT the City of Vancouver endorse the #AllOnBoard Campaign; the Mayor, on
behalf of Vancouver City Council, write a letter to the TransLink Mayors’ Council
on Regional Transportation, the Board of Directors of TransLink, the Ministry of
Municipal Affairs and Housing and the Ministry of Social Development and
Poverty Reduction asking TransLink to work with the provincial government to
finalize and secure funding, and develop a plan that will provide free public transit
for minors (aged 0-18), and reduced price transit based on a sliding scale using
the Market Basket Measure for all low income people regardless of their
demographic profile as soon as possible.
B. THAT the Mayor, on behalf of Vancouver City Council, write a separate letter to
the Mayors’ Council on Regional Transportation asking them to:
1) require TransLink adopt a poverty reduction/equity mandate in order to
address the outstanding issue of lack of affordability measures to ensure
those who need public transit the most can access the essential service;
2) request the Mayors’ Council on Regional Transportation and TransLink
immediately and without delay amend existing by-laws and cease
ticketing all minors for fare evasion as the first step towards the full
implementation of free transit for children and youth (aged 0-18); and
FURTHER REQUEST THAT Translink adopt a poverty reduction
mandate based on non-stigmatizing affordability measures, including
unlinking fare evasion fines from the Insurance Corporation of British
Columbia and infrastructure expansion; and the introduction of community
service and restorative justice options for adults as an alternative to fare
evasion tickets.
C. THAT the resolution regarding support for the #AllOnBoard Campaign be
forwarded for consideration at the 2019 Lower Mainland Local Government
Association (LMLGA) convention and subsequent Union of BC Municipalities
(UBCM) convention.

D. THAT the #AllOnBoard forthcoming research report containing evidence and
testimonies in support of the #AllOnBoard Campaign be included in the
submission to the Lower Mainland Local Government Association (LMLGA) once
available.
E. THAT the Mayor, on behalf of Vancouver City Council, write the Federal
Government, the Office of the Prime Minister, and the Honourable Minister of
National Revenue requesting the reinstatement of the 15% federal tax credit on
transit passes, and consider making this tax credit refundable. In order to meet
