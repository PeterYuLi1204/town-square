WHEREAS
1. The Granville Bridge runs directly over Granville Island, which has seen 21
suicide incidents, including 6 fatalities, since 2019, with marked increases in
individuals with suicide-related activity since 2019, requiring rescue or response
from local mariners1 and/or Granville Island security;

2. The Granville Bridge Connector project is designed to make the Granville bridge
safer and more accessible to people walking and rolling. Attracting more
pedestrians will require adequate fencing for basic safety, and the minimum
standard for pedestrian fencing in hazardous areas is 1.8 metres. Current fencing
on Granville Bridge is 1.14 metres2, effective suicide prevention fencing height is
a minimum of 2.3 metres;
3. Physical barriers on bridges, such as adequate fencing, are the only effective
way to stop suicides by jumping from bridges, and are associated with a 93%
reduction in suicide deaths per year.3 Crisis phones on bridges are known to be
ineffective deterrents and should be seen as a tool to connect people in distress
rather than effective suicide prevention;
4. The installation of suicide barriers on the Burrard Bridge has resulted in zero
suicide deaths from that Bridge since 2017;
5. Responding to incidents on bridges without barriers are much more dangerous
for both the person in distress and the police, fire, ambulance, and bystanders
seeking to help; adding increased pressure on an already high-pressure
situation;
6. Rising construction costs suggest that delaying the design and construction of
suicide prevention barriers to a later date will cost considerably more than current
construction costs;
7. The Capital Plan Mid Term Update, presented to Council on June 26th, includes
$300,000 to support a conceptual design of means prevention fencing on the
Granville Bridge, to provide greater certainty on the project cost and scope.
Council committing funds to implement the project would help to secure matching
funds from senior levels of government.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council commit to installing means prevention fencing as part of the
Granville Street Connector construction.
B. THAT Council commit to fully funding this means prevention fencing as an
indication of the City’s commitment to the project and intention to preserve the
lives of individuals in mental health crisis, and direct staff to seek senior
government funding and support;
FURTHER THAT Council direct staff to reallocate funds as part of the next
capital plan reallocation update.

RESOLUTION
Including Means Prevention Fencing Within the National Suicide Prevention Action Plan
WHEREAS, Physical barriers on bridges, such as adequate fencing, are the only
effective way to stop suicides by jumping from bridges, and are associated with a 93%
reduction in suicide deaths per year, and responding to incidents on bridges without
barriers are much more dangerous for both the person in distress and the police, fire,

of suicide prevention barriers to a later date will cost considerably more than current
construction costs; now therefore be it
RESOLVED, That the Federation of Canadian Municipalities advocate that the federal
government include municipal infrastructure funding to help municipalities with the costs
of adding life-saving suicide means prevention barriers to existing bridges in Canada, as
part of the Means Prevention mandate in the National Suicide Prevention Action Plan

2. Taking Urgent Action to Boost Street Capacity and Speed up Transit Service for
Vancouverites
The Committee heard from 35 speakers who spoke in support of the motion and one speaker
who spoke in opposition to the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Boyle
SECONDED by Councillor Dominato
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. In November 2023, City Council unanimously committed to addressing delay and
overcrowding on transit by investing in cost-effective transit priority measures7.
Since November, ridership and overcrowding have continued to grow resulting in
bus riders throughout Metro Vancouver spending over 28,000 hours stuck in
traffic every weekday;
2. Crucial bus routes in Vancouver are getting slower, increasing operating costs
and diverting resources away from addressing crowding despite Vancouver
being more reliant on buses than almost any other city in Canada or the US,
having the second highest ridership per capita8;

3. Dedicated bus lanes are a quick and inexpensive solution allowing the City to
quickly increase the capacity of the transportation system to quadruple the
carrying capacity of a single travel lane9, as demonstrated during the 2010
Olympics10;
4. Slow transit travel times are one of the top reasons Metro Vancouver residents
choose to drive. Transit priority projects across the Lower Mainland have
consistently resulted in 5-35% reductions in travel time11, a difference significant
enough to typically increase ridership by 4% to 6%12;
5. Transit delays do not impact everyone equally. 24% of households in Vancouver
have no car access at all. This number is much higher among those with lower
income, recent immigrants, and certain visible minority groups13. South
Vancouver is one of the most diverse parts of the region14 and is one of the most
reliant on public transit15;
6. The demand for transit will continue increasing in the coming years, with the City
population expected to grow by about 1% (approximately 7,000 people)16
annually. In addition to projected population growth, the 2026 FIFA World Cup
will necessitate infrastructure to support moving hundreds of thousands of
additional people over the 2-week tournament;
7. In order to reach the City’s commitments of 2/3 of trips being made on foot, bike
or transit by 2030 outlined in Transportation 204017, a mode shift of
approximately 2% per year away from personal motor vehicles to walking,
cycling, or transit is required;
8. Offset Bus Lanes can be implemented18 where bus lanes run through
commercial zones. This preserves space for loading, parking, and patios in the
curbside lane, improving transit while also supporting local businesses;
9. TransLink has identified eight corridors in Vancouver as top priorities19 for bus
lane improvements. Funding available for this work is currently being left on the

THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT the City of Vancouver work with TransLink to design and implement
dedicated bus lanes, as outlined in TransLink’s 2024 Bus Speed and Reliability
Report21, along the eight priority corridors in Vancouver22, including along the
routes where ongoing speed and reliability planning work was initiated by the
motion “Advancing Rapid Transit and Priority RapidBus upgrade Projects in
Vancouver to Support Complete Communities, Livability and Growth” passed in
2023:
a. Southeast Marine Drive
b. 49th Avenue
c. Hastings Street
d. Main Street / Kingsway
As well as the four additional TransLink top priority routes not covered in the
previous motion:
e. Broadway
f. King Edward Avenue
g. West 4th Avenue
h. Downtown to the Ironworkers Memorial Bridge (Powell, Cordova, and
others)
FURTHER THAT the City of Vancouver commit to completing the above
improvements at a rate of at least 2 corridors per year beginning in 2025; and
that the City work together with TransLink to determine the optimal order;
AND FURTHER THAT where new proposed bus lanes would run through
commercial areas, City staff work with TransLink and local Business
Improvement Associations (BIAs) to address concerns and maintain loading
access and patio space where that is a BIA priority.
B. THAT Council direct the City Manager to allocate sufficient planning and
engineering resources to access additional TransLink funding for implementing
these transit priority measures.
C. THAT Council request the Mayor write a letter to the Province advocating for
automated bus lane enforcement within the City of Vancouver.

UNANIMOUSLY (Vote No. 10178) with Councillor Montague absent for the vote.

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, July 24, 2024 15
FINAL MOTION AS APPROVED
WHEREAS
1. In November 2023, City Council unanimously committed to addressing delay and
overcrowding on transit by investing in cost-effective transit priority measures23.
Since November, ridership and overcrowding have continued to grow resulting in
bus riders throughout Metro Vancouver spending over 28,000 hours stuck in
traffic every weekday;
2. Crucial bus routes in Vancouver are getting slower, increasing operating costs
and diverting resources away from addressing crowding despite Vancouver
being more reliant on buses than almost any other city in Canada or the US,
having the second highest ridership per capita24;
3. Dedicated bus lanes are a quick and inexpensive solution allowing the City to
quickly increase the capacity of the transportation system to quadruple the
carrying capacity of a single travel lane25, as demonstrated during the 2010
Olympics26;
4. Slow transit travel times are one of the top reasons Metro Vancouver residents
choose to drive. Transit priority projects across the Lower Mainland have
consistently resulted in 5-35% reductions in travel time27, a difference significant
enough to typically increase ridership by 4% to 6%28;
5. Transit delays do not impact everyone equally. 24% of households in Vancouver
have no car access at all. This number is much higher among those with lower
income, recent immigrants, and certain visible minority groups29. South
Vancouver is one of the most diverse parts of the region30 and is one of the most
reliant on public transit31;
6. The demand for transit will continue increasing in the coming years, with the City
population expected to grow by about 1% (approximately 7,000 people)32
annually. In addition to projected population growth, the 2026 FIFA World Cup
will necessitate infrastructure to support moving hundreds of thousands of
additional people over the 2-week tournament;

7. In order to reach the City’s commitments of 2/3 of trips being made on foot, bike
or transit by 2030 outlined in Transportation 204033, a mode shift of
approximately 2% per year away from personal motor vehicles to walking,
cycling, or transit is required;
8. Offset Bus Lanes can be implemented34 where bus lanes run through
commercial zones. This preserves space for loading, parking, and patios in the
curbside lane, improving transit while also supporting local businesses;
9. TransLink has identified eight corridors in Vancouver as top priorities35 for bus
lane improvements. Funding available for this work is currently being left on the
table. These solutions are an excellent investment, with most projects paying for
themselves within 10 years and many within 2 years36.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT the City of Vancouver work with TransLink to design and implement
dedicated bus lanes, as outlined in TransLink’s 2024 Bus Speed and Reliability
Report, along the nine priority corridors in Vancouver, including along the routes
where ongoing speed and reliability planning work was initiated by and resulting
from the motion “Advancing Rapid Transit and Priority RapidBus upgrade
Projects in Vancouver to Support Complete Communities, Livability and Growth”
passed in 2023, and the subsequent approval and achieved funding from
TransLink of $11 million for bus-priority corridors in the City’s current Action Plan
which is on-track to achieve five completed corridors by 2026 at a rate of at least
2 corridors per year:
a) Granville Street
b) Southeast Marine Drive
c) 49th Avenue
d) Hastings Street
e) Main Street / Kingsway
As well as the four additional TransLink top priority routes not covered in the
previous motion:
f) Broadway, with consideration to the work underway to complete a
Great Street
g) King Edward Avenue
h) West 4th Avenue
i) Downtown to the Ironworkers Memorial Bridge (Powell, Cordova, and
others), in alignment with previous Council direction on May 10, 2023, to
engage with Translink on the potential of changing Cordova Street to a

3. Closing the Gap: Investing in the City of Vancouver’s Food System to Increase
Food Access and Support a Resilient, Equitable, and Sustainable Food System for
All
The Committee heard from ten speakers who spoke in support of the motion.

WHEREAS
1. Household food insecurity37 is when a household worries about or lacks the
financial means to buy nutritious, safe, and personally acceptable foods;
2. While food insecurity and income/poverty largely remain the jurisdiction of senior
levels of government, municipal government nonetheless has an important role
to play in supporting a resilient, equitable, accessible, and sustainable food
system for all Vancouver residents;
3. Food insecurity remains a persistent and growing problem in the region with the
2023 estimates for British Columbia (BC) being the highest in almost 20 years of

Minutes, Wednesday, July 24, 2024 18
monitoring. In 2023, 21.8% of people are living in food insecure households in
BC38 (6.2% marginally food insecure, 9.8% moderately food insecure, 5.8%
severely food insecure). This represents a significant increase in food insecurity
from 16.8% of BC households in 2022. Rising pressures have contributed to
increasing food insecurity, including housing affordability, inflation, and climate-
related impacts to our food supply;
4. Food insecurity is closely tied to structural inequities, racism, discrimination, and
colonialism, and certain populations are disproportionately impacted by food
insecurity:
• Indigenous population aged 15 years and over in BC: 39.2%
• Recent immigrants (10 years or less) aged 15 years and over in BC:
24.9%
• Children under the age of 18 in BC: 28.8%;
5. The 2023 Metro Vancouver Living Wage for Families BC39 report outlined that a
third of two-parent families in Metro Vancouver have total family incomes below
the living wage family income (32%). In addition, food is the second-most
expensive item in the living wage family budget and one of the fastest growing,
dwarfed only by the costs of shelter. Food prices in BC are increasing nearly
twice as fast as general inflation, as indicated by the Consumer Price Index for
food. Food costs rose by 6.1% since last year, adding an extra $68 per month to
the family budget;
6. The negative impacts of food insecurity on people’s physical and social well-
being have been well documented. Research findings demonstrate the
associations between food insecurity and adverse health and well-being
outcomes in child, youth, adult, and senior populations. Children in food insecure
households have an increased likelihood of various adverse physical health,
development, social, and academic outcomes. Among adults and seniors,
household food insecurity is linked with poorer dietary intake, diabetes
management, cognitive health, and mental health outcomes;
7. We have a rising food insecurity problem; and we also have a broken food
system. In Canada, 58% of the food produced40 (35.5 million tonnes) is lost and
wasted annually; and 32% of this food (valued at about $49.46 billion) is edible
and could be redirected to support people in our communities. In Canada, only
4% of surplus edible food is rescued41 and redistributed. In addition, food waste
represents a critical environmental challenge: 6-8% of global greenhouse gas
emissions are the result of food loss and waste; and 56.5 million tonnes of
CO2eq emissions are created annually in Canada due to food loss and waste;
8. While food insecurity is the inadequate or insecure access to food due to
financial constraints (an income/poverty problem), community and social service
organizations in Vancouver have nonetheless been instrumental in addressing

complex food systems challenges and rising food insecurity in the city,
demonstrating remarkable resilience and innovation in expanding food access
and sustainability initiatives amidst increasing demand for food systems support.
Many organizations have pivoted or expanded their food services (especially
during COVID-19) to meet community needs; but most of the emergency funding
has decreased/ended, even though the demand for food programs remains
elevated. In this context, food donations from businesses have played a crucial
role in mitigating food insecurity (and reducing food waste), allowing
organizations with limited budgets and capacity to meet the rising demand for
food program and services. As outlined in the City of Vancouver Map of Free and
Low-Cost Food Programs42, 79 food programs are currently available to
Vancouver residents in need of food services, and the City of Vancouver
gratefully acknowledges the ongoing support provided by these organizations;
9. This mismatch between community needs and nonprofits’ capacity to meet those
needs has been documented. Findings from the 2024 State of BC’s Non-Profit
Sector report43 outlined that 76% of BC nonprofits surveyed reported an
increased demand for overall services, but 31% reported their capacity to
respond to community needs had decreased;
10. An array of community-led and nonprofit organizations are advancing food
security, addressing the impacts of food insecurity, and reclaiming Indigenous
food sovereignty. A selection of the food systems initiatives in the City of
Vancouver include:
• The Vancouver Neighbourhood Food Networks (VNFN)44 are a
network of community organizations committed to promoting food security
in neighbourhoods across the City of Vancouver (15 networks now exist
in Vancouver). VNFN is committed to food equity and access, education,
skill building, and advocacy, particularly for community members who are
struggling economically. This work is based on the principle that all
members of society have the right to quality food. VNFN provides a space
for networks to collaborate, share best practices and advocate for food
equity and justice, ecologically and culturally sustainable food systems,
and community food resilience with a unified voice. In 2023, the VNFN
served 47,668 people, distributed 81,693 food boxes and 156,693 meals,
and hosted 1,097 food and garden workshops;
• Several urban Indigenous food projects are aiming to reclaim
Indigenous food sovereignty and restore Indigenous food systems in the
City of Vancouver, including the V6A Garden at the Astoria Hotel, which
provides a critical reconnection with land and traditional practice for many
living in the Downtown Eastside. Dawn Morrison’s work with the Ancestral
Foodways Project in Strathcona Park provides a reconceptualization
framework for traditional food growing that transcends the scope and
scale of the dominant agricultural narrative; and Leona Brown’s work with

the Vancouver Urban Food Forest Foundation provides another form of
ancestral food growing and land stewardship used by Indigenous and
Coast Salish Nations since time immemorial;
• The informal Vancouver Food Recovery Network provides essential
food donations to over 150 community-serving organizations providing
food programming, allowing these organizations to tackle the City’s most
pressing issues: homelessness, substance use, mental health
challenges, domestic violence, and systemic racism. Most of these
partner organizations specialize in serving low-income people and equity-
seeking groups and are challenged with funding and capacity limits; and
the Vancouver Food Recovery Network supports their food-related
programming, which is part of a broader holistic approach to community
development. In 2023, the four largest food recovery organizations in the
city (Food Stash Foundation, Vancouver Food Runners, Quest Nonprofit
Grocery Markets, and CityReach Care Society) collected and distributed
4.47 million pounds of healthy, edible surplus food (3.72 million equivalent
meals) (in-kind value: $15.72 million), and this mitigated approximately
7.55 million pounds of CO2eq from the environment. This work also
saves the City of Vancouver and businesses money by rerouting their
surplus food to the best possible end use;
11. The unique economic, geographic, and demographic characteristics of
Vancouver necessitates multi-sector, place-based, and tailored local responses
to these challenges, including municipal investments in food systems
programming and services. Importantly, place-based initiatives help to increase
collaboration across organizations, build trust between communities and
organizations, use local strengths to build essential assets, and connect
grassroots efforts to the public policy sector. Unfortunately, local organizations
are currently stretched beyond capacity to meet the demand from residents
experiencing food insecurity and needing food services. In Vancouver Food
Runners’ 2023 Nonprofit Partner Feedback Survey (completed by 41
organizations operating food programs and providing wraparound social
services), the top two challenges to operate their food programs were funding
and lack of infrastructure (fridges/freezers);
12. Given rising food insecurity in Vancouver and the pressures on nonprofit
organizations to meet community needs, the Vancouver Food Policy Council
(with data provided by City of Vancouver staff) has identified several concerning
trends in municipal funding for food systems work:
• Limited funding: Within the $2.2 billion City of Vancouver 2024
Operating Budget, only $700,826 is earmarked for food-focused operating
grants. Regular access to food is foundational for good health, mental
well-being, and a thriving community, but the City of Vancouver only
allocated 0.03% of the 2024 Operating Budget towards food systems
initiatives;
• No increase to food funding over time: Funding for food systems has
remained stagnant, with no increases to address inflation nor rising

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, July 24, 2024 21
community demand: total food systems funding has remained under
$950,000 for the last four years. The $950,000 represents combined
funding for food systems work across Operating and Capital budgets and
includes investments through ACCS (Social Policy and Projects) and
PDS (Sustainability and Strategic and Long-Range Planning) Most of this
funding is variable year to year. The only sources of dedicated food
systems funding are the Sustainable Food Systems an school Food
grants, which are nested under the Social Policy Grants Operating
Budget and totalled $680,000 in 2024;
• Demand for food funding is growing: the Sustainable Food Systems
Grant is oversubscribed. In 2022, $413,588 was requested from
organizations, but only $202,516 was allocated; and many organizations
that need funding do not even apply to this grant because they know their
chance of receiving funding is so low;
• No funding for certain initiatives: Within the current funding
parameters, certain projects remain underfunded or unfunded at the
municipal level, particularly Indigenous food sovereignty initiatives and
food recovery programs (e.g. Food Stash, Vancouver Food Runners,
Quest Nonprofit Grocery Markets, and CityReach Care Society);
13. The City of Vancouver recognizes the importance of regular food access for
residents and a sustainable and resilient food system, as several City of
Vancouver strategies and action plans highlight the importance of food. As
outlined in the City of Vancouver Healthy City Strategy (2015-2018), food plays a
powerful role in connecting people, in building strong and resilient communities,
and in preventing and managing chronic illnesses;
14. The Vancouver Food Strategy (2013) includes supporting and enabling
community food assets; empowering residents to be involved in community food
programming (e.g., volunteering, job skills training, working); and improving
Vancouver residents’ regular access to healthy food;
15. With respect to the recent Park Board Local Food Action Plan (2023), objectives
include increasing food assets; advancing sustainable local food economies; and
engaging and increasing the capacity of Vancouver food networks;
16. The Vancouver Plan (2022) also highlighted that food is a basic human right and
a defining element of day-to-day life for residents, and that food insecurity is
higher among equity-denied groups, such as racialized and Indigenous
community members. In the Plan, the City of Vancouver has committed to
ensuring a just and sustainable food system, with a focus on multiple core
elements: improving food access, supporting and strengthening Vancouver’s
food supply chain, leveraging new development and community infrastructure for
food systems work, and addressing climate change. The Vancouver Plan also
outlines that the food system is also a major climate change driver, contributing
up to one third of global GHG emissions;

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, July 24, 2024 22
17. Investing in food systems is also aligned with City Council’s current strategic
priorities (2023 – 2026);
• With respect to “healthy, inclusive, and equitable,” improving food
access directly puts Vancouverites’ physical and mental health front and
centre and alleviates barriers to residents’ well-being and sense of
belonging;
• Directly supporting Indigenous food systems will support Reconciliation,
advance Indigenous food sovereignty, and nurture a mutually respectful
relationship with the local Indigenous Nations (this is also a Call to Action
in the City of Vancouver’s UNDRIP Strategy);
• Supporting initiatives that help to prevent food waste addresses the
climate emergency and advances circular practices in the food sector.
This work also supports businesses with reducing their food and
hauling costs and helps them to become more sustainable;
• Investing in a food system that is vibrant and diverse also allows for
innovation, job creation, and ensures that Vancouver remains a dynamic
and engaging city for all;
18. Despite recent 2023 contributions through the BC government ($200 million to
increase food security [including $30 million for Indigenous food sovereignty],
and $214 million for the Feeding Futures Fund to improve food access for
children at school), these funds remain insufficient to achieve universal food
access in Vancouver and bridge gaps across socioeconomic backgrounds,
underscoring the urgent need for enhanced municipal investment to achieve
physical well-being, mental health, emotional resilience, and equity goals;
19. An increase in municipal funding for local food assets and programs would allow
the City of Vancouver to align its efforts with the province and improve resource
efficiency, service delivery, policy consistency, community well-being,
cross-jurisdictional legislative support, and enhanced accountability.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
THAT Council direct City of Vancouver staff to explore and develop a food
systems funding strategy that is in line with City Council’s strategic priorities;
examines an increase to Social Operating Grants; and will address the gap
between current municipal food systems funding and the need for financial
investments that will create a resilient, equitable, sustainable, innovative, and
vibrant food system for all Vancouver residents, with particular attention given to:
• Increasing funding for the Sustainable Food Systems Grant;
• Creating an Indigenous Food Systems Grant;
• Creating a funding or contract mechanism specifically for initiatives that
recover and redirect food from waste.

development. In 2023, the four largest food recovery organizations in the
city (Food Stash Foundation, Vancouver Food Runners, Quest Nonprofit
Grocery Markets, and CityReach Care Society) collected and distributed
4.47 million pounds of healthy, edible surplus food (3.72 million equivalent
meals) (in-kind value: $15.72 million), and this mitigated approximately
7.55 million pounds of CO2eq from the environment. This work also
saves the City of Vancouver and businesses money by rerouting their
surplus food to the best possible end use;
11. The unique economic, geographic, and demographic characteristics of
Vancouver necessitates multi-sector, place-based, and tailored local responses
to these challenges, including municipal investments in food systems
programming and services. Importantly, place-based initiatives help to increase
collaboration across organizations, build trust between communities and
organizations, use local strengths to build essential assets, and connect
grassroots efforts to the public policy sector. Unfortunately, local organizations
are currently stretched beyond capacity to meet the demand from residents
experiencing food insecurity and needing food services. In Vancouver Food
Runners’ 2023 Nonprofit Partner Feedback Survey (completed by 41
organizations operating food programs and providing wraparound social
services), the top two challenges to operate their food programs were funding
and lack of infrastructure (fridges/freezers);
12. Given rising food insecurity in Vancouver and the pressures on nonprofit
organizations to meet community needs, the Vancouver Food Policy Council
(with data provided by City of Vancouver staff) has identified several concerning
trends in municipal funding for food systems work:
• Limited funding: Within the $2.2 billion City of Vancouver 2024
Operating Budget, only $700,826 is earmarked for food-focused operating
grants. Regular access to food is foundational for good health, mental
well-being, and a thriving community, but the City of Vancouver only
allocated 0.03% of the 2024 Operating Budget towards food systems

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, July 24, 2024 27
initiatives;
• No increase to food funding over time: Funding for food systems has
remained stagnant, with no increases to address inflation nor rising
community demand: total food systems funding has remained under
$950,000 for the last four years. The $950,000 represents combined
funding for food systems work across Operating and Capital budgets and
includes investments through ACCS (Social Policy and Projects) and
PDS (Sustainability and Strategic and Long-Range Planning) Most of this
funding is variable year to year. The only sources of dedicated food
systems funding are the Sustainable Food Systems an school Food
grants, which are nested under the Social Policy Grants Operating
Budget and totalled $680,000 in 2024;
• Demand for food funding is growing: the Sustainable Food Systems
Grant is oversubscribed. In 2022, $413,588 was requested from
organizations, but only $202,516 was allocated; and many organizations
that need funding do not even apply to this grant because they know their
chance of receiving funding is so low;
• No funding for certain initiatives: Within the current funding
parameters, certain projects remain underfunded or unfunded at the
municipal level, particularly Indigenous food sovereignty initiatives and
food recovery programs (e.g. Food Stash, Vancouver Food Runners,
Quest Nonprofit Grocery Markets, and CityReach Care Society);
13. The City of Vancouver recognizes the importance of regular food access for
residents and a sustainable and resilient food system, as several City of
Vancouver strategies and action plans highlight the importance of food. As
outlined in the City of Vancouver Healthy City Strategy (2015-2018), food plays a
powerful role in connecting people, in building strong and resilient communities,
and in preventing and managing chronic illnesses;
14. The Vancouver Food Strategy (2013) includes supporting and enabling
community food assets; empowering residents to be involved in community food
programming (e.g., volunteering, job skills training, working); and improving
Vancouver residents’ regular access to healthy food;
15. With respect to the recent Park Board Local Food Action Plan (2023), objectives
include increasing food assets; advancing sustainable local food economies; and
engaging and increasing the capacity of Vancouver food networks;
16. The Vancouver Plan (2022) also highlighted that food is a basic human right and
a defining element of day-to-day life for residents, and that food insecurity is
higher among equity-denied groups, such as racialized and Indigenous
community members. In the Plan, the City of Vancouver has committed to
ensuring a just and sustainable food system, with a focus on multiple core
elements: improving food access, supporting and strengthening Vancouver’s
food supply chain, leveraging new development and community infrastructure for
food systems work, and addressing climate change. The Vancouver Plan also

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, July 24, 2024 28
outlines that the food system is also a major climate change driver, contributing
up to one third of global GHG emissions;
17. Investing in food systems is also aligned with City Council’s current strategic
priorities (2023 – 2026);
• With respect to “healthy, inclusive, and equitable,” improving food
access directly puts Vancouverites’ physical and mental health front and
centre and alleviates barriers to residents’ well-being and sense of
belonging;
• Directly supporting Indigenous food systems will support Reconciliation,
advance Indigenous food sovereignty, and nurture a mutually respectful
relationship with the local Indigenous Nations (this is also a Call to Action
in the City of Vancouver’s UNDRIP Strategy);
• Supporting initiatives that help to prevent food waste addresses the
climate emergency and advances circular practices in the food sector.
This work also supports businesses with reducing their food and
hauling costs and helps them to become more sustainable;
• Investing in a food system that is vibrant and diverse also allows for
innovation, job creation, and ensures that Vancouver remains a dynamic
and engaging city for all;
18. Despite recent 2023 contributions through the BC government ($200 million to
increase food security [including $30 million for Indigenous food sovereignty],
and $214 million for the Feeding Futures Fund to improve food access for
children at school), these funds remain insufficient to achieve universal food
access in Vancouver and bridge gaps across socioeconomic backgrounds,
underscoring the urgent need for enhanced municipal investment to achieve
physical well-being, mental health, emotional resilience, and equity goals;
19. An increase in municipal funding for local food assets and programs would allow
the City of Vancouver to align its efforts with the province and improve resource
efficiency, service delivery, policy consistency, community well-being,
cross-jurisdictional legislative support, and enhanced accountability.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct City of Vancouver staff to explore and develop a food
systems funding strategy that is in line with City Council’s strategic priorities;
examines an increase to Social Operating Grants; and will address the gap
between current municipal food systems funding and the need for financial
investments that will create a resilient, equitable, sustainable, innovative, and
vibrant food system for all Vancouver residents, with particular attention given to:
• Increasing funding for the Sustainable Food Systems Grant;
• Creating an Indigenous Food Systems Grant;

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, July 24, 2024 29
• Creating a funding or contract mechanism specifically for initiatives that
recover and redirect food from waste.
FURTHER THAT Council direct staff to consider the funding requests contained
in this motion as part of the internal review of the Sustainable Food Systems
grant stream planned for summer-fall 2024, in anticipation of launching a new set
of multi-year grants in Q1 2025.
B. THAT Council recognizes that the ability to obtain secure, affordable operating
space in neighbourhoods across the City is crucial to food driven non-profits and
service providers and to ensuring a sustainable food system in Vancouver;
FURTHER THAT Council direct staff to evaluate opportunities in City owned or
operated buildings in need areas across the City of below market leases for food
driven non-profits in order to support a resilient, geographically distributed,
sustainable food system, and to support the financial health and stability of these
City benefitting services, and report back to Council by January 2025 with
options, considerations and recommendations.

LAW NO._____,” which would serve to create a new Code of Conduct By-Law
applicable to Council Members and Advisory Board Members;
4. Additionally, the January 20, 2021, staff report to Council identified several other
key recommendations, including (but not limited to):
• Retaining an independent third party on a set term with a mandate for
education, advice, and investigation;
• Minimizing overlap between the new Code and other applicable
legislation;
• Setting a procedure for regular review of the Code.
5. On February 9, 2021, Council enacted the new Code of Conduct By-law as
recommended by staff (BY-LAW NO. 12886);
6. Under section 5.1 of the Code of Conduct By-Law No. 12886, the appointment of
an Integrity Commissioner is a defined action, as are the respective duties and
responsibilities of the Commissioner, which are set out in section 5.7 of the
Code. These duties and responsibilities include:
• to investigate City Council and Advisory Board member’s Code of
Conduct By-Law complaints;
• to provide advice and recommendations to City Council and Advisory
Board members regarding their ethical obligations and responsibilities;
• to aid the public in their understanding of the Code of Conduct By-Law,
the Vancouver Charter, and the Code of Conduct;
7. In March 2021, Council appointed the first ad hoc Integrity Commissioner for the
City of Vancouver under the Code of Conduct By-Law and then in January 2022
appointed the first Commissioner for a two-year term;
8. The Code of Conduct requires the Integrity Commissioner to publish an annual
report by December 1 of each year that includes a summary of the work of the
Integrity Commissioner and any advice or recommendations that the Integrity
Commissioner has that might improve the text or operation of the By-law;
9. On December 1, 2022, the Office of the Integrity Commissioner submitted its first

2022;
10. The Integrity Commissioner’s annual report for 2022 identified several
recommendations to improve the efficacy of the Code of Conduct By-law. City
staff subsequently reviewed these recommendations and, on April 26, 2023 and
again on May 10, 2023, presented the results of their review to Council and

Council and Advisory Board Members is not always clear. We
recommend this be mitigated through amendments to the Code of
Conduct By-law.”;
16. Carrying out reviews and evaluations of programs, policies, and procedures on

of outside objectivity and expertise, is a hallmark of good governance best
practices and the value of a continuous process of improvement. It is therefore
