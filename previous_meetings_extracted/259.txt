NEW BUSINESS
1. Sanctions for Mayor Sim’s Violation of the Code of Conduct By-law in Creating a
Discriminatory Workplace by Excluding Commissioner Christensen from Meeting
MOVED by Councillor Fry
SECONDED by Councillor Carr
WHEREAS
1. On December 11, 2023, a member of the public filed a formal complaint against
Ken Sim, alleging a violation of Vancouver Code of Conduct By-law by Mayor
Sim and two employees, when Park Board Commissioner Laura Christensen
was denied the opportunity to attend a December 5 meeting convened by the
mayor for the purpose of City business, which was discriminatory given that
Commissioner Christensen was caring for a newborn;
2. In the circumstances of the complaint, Vancouver’s independent Office of the
Integrity Commissioner found that Mayor Sim breached sections 2(e) and 3.4(c)
of the Code of Conduct By-law with respect to Commissioner Christensen’s
exclusion from the December 5 Meeting:
Mayor Sim’s actions created a distinction based on Commissioner Christensen’s
sex and family status, and this had an adverse impact on her. He knew
Commissioner Christensen had a newborn. Previously, her situation had been
accommodated by allowing her to attend meetings remotely because attending in
person in the later stages of pregnancy or with a newborn were challenging.
However, despite this and despite the importance of the December 5 Meeting to

Council Meeting
Minutes, March 12, 2024 23
the Park Board, Mayor Sim did not make reasonable efforts to ensure
Commissioner Christensen knew the Meeting was important and there could be
consequences for her if she did not attend.
– Office of the Integrity Commissioner2
The Integrity Commissioner further found there was no evidence that the
exclusions found in their investigation that gave rise to a breach were done on
purpose or by design by Mayor Sim;
3. In their ruling dated February 21, 2024, the Integrity Commissioner
recommended that the following sanctions be imposed for violating the Code of
Conduct By-law:
a. A letter of reprimand from Council addressed to Mayor Sim;
b. A request from Council that Mayor Sim issue a letter of apology to
Commissioner Christensen;
c. The publication of both; and
d. Further training for Council on human rights obligations and training for
the Mayor's employees on the same;
4. Timely delivery of the aforementioned sanctions is required within 30 days of the
Integrity Commissioner's February 21, 2023 recommendations, per the terms of
the City of Vancouver Code of Conduct By-law:
Council must, within 30 days of delivery of the investigation report pursuant to
section 6.32 (e), or a longer period if approved by a vote of Council, decide on
the appropriate measures, if any, that are warranted by the breach of this By-law,
and will take such actions as Council considers appropriate in the
circumstances.3
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council requests staff provide remedial training
for all of Council on human rights obligations including but not limited to provisions in the
Code of Conduct By-law and applicable provisions of the Vancouver Charter;
FURTHER THAT Council releases the letter of reprimand below to Mayor Sim including
acknowledgement of the March 11 issuance of a letter of apology to Commissioner
Christensen, to be published in Council minutes.

Council Meeting
Minutes, March 12, 2024 24
This is a formal reprimand letter in concurrence with recommendations from the Integrity
Commissioner regarding the discriminatory incident of December 5, 2023 where
Commissioner Christensen was excluded from a meeting of your office.
Commissioner Christensen had given birth to a baby four weeks prior to the December 5
Meeting. You did not make reasonable efforts or accommodations to ensure the
Commissioner could attend the meeting or understand its importance and consequences
of not attending.
Your actions created a distinction based on Commissioner Christensen’s sex and family
status which are rightly defined as discrimination in the BC Human Rights Code and
section 15 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
We are not suggesting this was deliberate or intentional discrimination on your part, but
the effect of your actions.
We are reminded as Vancouver City Council, that we must hold ourselves to a high
standard, where our role expects and affirms through our Oath of Office that we carry
out our duties with integrity, be accountable for the decisions we make, be respectful of
others, and demonstrate leadership and collaboration.
Additionally, as Vancouver City Council we are obliged by the Code of Conduct By-law,
which states under Section 2(e) that we must “ensure that the work environment is free
from discrimination and harassment.”
Acknowledging your recent letter of apology to Commissioner Christiansen, we hereby
respectfully request you commit to remedial training for yourself, your staff and office on
human rights obligations.
Sincerely
Vancouver City Council
