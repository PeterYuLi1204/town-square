4. Accelerating Housing Delivery Through Transformative Change
Mayor Sim moved the motion entitled “Accelerating Housing Delivery Through Transformative
Change” as urgent new business.
Per section 9.6 of the Procedure By-law, the Chair must rule whether or not the motion brought
forward is urgent business. After a brief recess, the Chair ruled the motion was deemed to be
urgent business as it reflects a connection to public health and safety with regard to the housing
crisis in the city.
The Acting General Manager, Planning, Urban Design and Sustainability, responded to
questions.

WHEREAS
1. In January 2023, in his first State of the City address to the Greater Vancouver
Board of Trade, Mayor Ken Sim cited prioritizing new home construction as a key
objective. He stated that “every single day, multiple times a day, I hear stories of
people – firsthand stories – of people leaving the city, or how they can’t afford

rent, or how they were in line with 75 other people trying to rent a basement
suite; that’s a crisis.”;
2. City permitting and other process and project approval delays have had a
significant impact on the delivery of badly needed housing supply in Vancouver;
3. On February 14, 2023, City staff presented a Permitting and Licensing Update to
Council in which they made note of the layers of complexity and competing
regulations and priorities that have impeded the City’s ability to issue permits and
get housing built,
4. The staff presentation in February 2023 not only outlined the nature of the
problem, staff also pointed to the need for a “transformative approach with radical
change” to improve the system and eliminate the layers of complexity that have
impeded the City’s ability to issue permits and get housing built;
5. Council has taken several key actions over the past year to begin to unravel the
layers of complexity and competing regulations and priorities that have impeded
the City’s ability to issue permits, approve projects, and get housing built in a fast
and efficient manner. A non-exhaustive list of examples includes:
• Established a 3-3-3-1 Permit Approval Framework to eliminate the City’s
housing construction backlog with fixed timeline improvement targets.
• Established a new combined residential zone for missing middle housing
(R1-1) to allow for up to 6 units of housing (or 8 secured rental units) on
low-density residential lots across the City.
• Initiated a review process to modernize the City’s View Protection
Guidelines to unlock new housing and economic opportunities.
• Approved strategic amendments to several major community and corridor
plans to increase housing supply rapidly, such as pre-zoning 200 lots in
the Cambie Corridor for as many as 1,600 townhomes and row house
units, pre-zoning a dozen land parcels in Broadway Corridor for 8-12
storey building, and eliminating the redundant pace of change policy
under the Broadway Plan.
• Acknowledged and applauded City staff's efforts to simplify the rezoning
application process to reduce the approval time for rainwater
management plans from 56 weeks to a mere 3 weeks for Sustainable
Large Developments under the Green Buildings Policy for Rezonings;
6. In November 2022, the Province of BC enacted the Housing Supply Act, which
gives the Province the authority to set housing targets in municipalities, starting
with those with the greatest need and highest projected growth. The targets
encourage municipalities to address local barriers to construction so that housing
can be built faster, including updating zoning by-laws and streamlining local
development approval processes. A target of 28,900 housing units has been set
for the City of Vancouver;

7. To meet the needs of our growing population and ensure that our City remains
vibrant and diverse, it’s vitally important that Council undertake urgent measures
to advance systemic transformational change to accelerate housing delivery in
the city in an efficient and timely manner, and in accordance with responsible
urban planning that ensures sustainable growth, addresses environmental
concerns, and enhances the City’s diverse neighbourhoods.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to accelerate implementation of the 26 Village Areas
outlined in the Vancouver Plan (Direction L1.7: Villages) to facilitate the
construction of townhouses, multiplex buildings, and mixed-use low-rise buildings
between 3-6 storeys in advance of Council formally adopting an Official
Community Plan for the City of Vancouver, to create more complete, inclusive,
and resilient neighbourhoods for people of different ages, incomes, and
backgrounds, including adding shops and services that can meet daily needs and
provide local jobs;
FURTHER THAT staff report back on opportunities for pre-zoning Village Areas,
which would allow projects to proceed directly to the development permit stage
and further accelerate the delivery of much-needed housing;
AND FURTHER THAT staff be directed to provide an initial report back by Q1
2024 with a scope of work, timeline, and outcomes to enable the Council
direction noted above, along with potential economic implications and
appropriate development cost expectations.
B. THAT Council direct staff to explore the steps and measures to harmonize and
otherwise align the Vancouver Building By-law (CBO), which regulates the
design and construction of buildings (including administrative provisions related
to permitting, inspections, and the enforcement of these requirements), with the
BC Building Code (BCBC), which governs how new construction, building
alterations, repairs and demolitions are completed, for a more rapid delivery of
housing in the City of Vancouver;
FURTHER THAT staff be directed to report back with a scope, timeline, and cost
for completing the work noted above by Q1 2024, including specific information
that outlines the differences and distinctions between the City’s By-law and the
Province’s Building Code, along with the impacts of these differences and
distinctions in terms of the timely delivery of housing;
AND FURTHER THAT specific caution should be given to those areas of policy
where the City has demonstrated leadership in sustainable and accessible
building practices to maintain a careful balance between best practices and
leadership on the climate file.
C. THAT Council direct staff to report back with a review of the City’s Shadow
Impact Criteria and Guidelines, including information related to distinctions
between solar access policies Council has formally enacted versus guidelines

Council Meeting
Minutes, October 17, 2023 31
based on urban design practices currently applied by City staff in the absence of
specific policy direction from Council;
FURTHER THAT staff be directed to explore and report back on the use of new
analytical tools, such as Parametric Modelling, that can more accurately quantify
the shadow impacts on the public realm of any given project based on its location
and context to better enable the permitting and construction of housing;
AND FURTHER THAT staff be directed to report back before the end of 2024.
D. THAT Council direct staff to explore opportunities to expand and improve the
City’s Certified Professional (CP) program, in consultation with the Architectural
Institute of BC (AIBC) and Engineers and Geoscientists British Columbia
(EGBC), pursuant to By-law No. 6203, which provides for the Certification of
Professional Engineers and Architects under Section 306(z) of the Vancouver
Charter, to more efficiently and effectively deliver a wide range of housing;
FURTHER for staff to report back by Q1 2024.
E. THAT Council direct staff to report back by Q1 2024 regarding opportunities to
increase the maximum allowable floor plate size for residential towers in order to
allow for greater design flexibility (e.g., for interior layouts, number of units, more
sustainable building practices, reduced construction costs, and enhanced
liveability) to unlock additional housing units.
F. THAT Council direct staff to report back on the opportunities and challenges to
realizing greater housing and mixed-use density through the rezoning of lands in
proximity to the City’s underdeveloped SkyTrain stations, such as Nanaimo
Station, 29th Avenue Station, Renfrew Station, and Rupert Station to better
advance the City’s various housing and economic objectives, while Council
affirms its commitment to the retention of industrial lands and their critical
importance in the well-being and economic success of our City;
FURTHER THAT staff be directed to report back by Q3 2024.
G. THAT Council requests the Mayor to write a letter to Premier David Eby and
Minister of Housing Ravi Kahlon to express the City’s support for increased
Provincial short-term rental enforcement programming proposals and indicate the
City’s willingness to adopt and collaborate on any potential improvements and
new tools that will help municipalities to better enforce compliance with
short-term rental rules, particularly where new tools will allow the City of
Vancouver to apply enforcement and other compliance measures more
effectively.
