1. Adding Missing Middle Housing and Simplifying Regulations – Amendments to
the Zoning and Development By-law
An application by the City of Vancouver was considered as follows:
Summary: Amendments to the Zoning and Development By-law to allow multiple
dwelling (multiplex) in low density (RS) residential zones as a new housing
option with additional units and density, subject to density bonus payment
provisions. Floor area incentives for passive house construction are also
included.
Amendments to the Zoning and Development By-law to reduce the maximum
size of new single-detached houses; increase the maximum size of new
laneway houses; simplify and reduce the number of zoning regulations that
apply to low density (RS) residential zones; and to consolidate the nine RS
residential zones (RS 1, RS-1A, RS-1B, RS-2, RS-3, RS-3A, RS-5, RS-6 and
RS-7) into a single new R1-1 Residential Inclusive zone.
Amendments to the Parking By-law and Zoning and Development Fee By-law
related to the changes proposed above and to repeal certain RS-related
design and other guidelines. Consequential amendments to the Subdivision
By-law, Street and Traffic By-law, Sign By-law and various land use
documents are also proposed.
The General Manager of Planning, Urban Design and Sustainability recommended approval
subject to conditions set out in the summary and recommendation.
Council also had before it a memorandum from the General Manager, Planning, Urban Design
and Sustainability dated September 1, 2023, entitled “Adding Missing Middle Housing and

Subdivision By-law: amendments in Appendix C to the Subdivision By-law of the Report dated

Amendments to the Zoning and Development By-law”; and a new section 7 of the above-noted
by-law which provided instructions to amend the maps attached to Schedule A of the above-
