2. Backing the Class Action Lawsuit Against Oil Companies
MOVED by Councillor Carr
SECONDED by Councillor Fry
WHEREAS
1. On June 16, 2022, West Coast Environmental Law launched a campaign called
“Sue Big Oil” to encourage municipalities to offer up to $1 per resident for a class
action lawsuit against fossil fuel companies;
2. Verified by the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change scientists in their
2022 reports, climate change is rapidly accelerating;
3. As evidenced by the local 2021 heat dome, atmospheric river, polar vortex and a
storm-driven king tide, the costs to repair damage resulting from climate change
events are enormous;
4. A 2020 report in The Guardian suggests that 20 fossil fuel companies are
responsible for one-third of carbon emissions worldwide;
5. Class action lawsuits, such as with the tobacco industry, have helped mitigate
the root problem and costs; and
6. In June of 2019, Vancouver City Council voted to direct Mayor Stewart to write to
large fossil fuel companies and request they contribute to climate change-related
costs.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Vancouver City Council direct staff to include in
the draft 2023 Operating Budget an amount up to $1 per Vancouver resident to support
West Coast Environmental Law’s class action lawsuit against fossil fuel companies.

3. Vancouver Hosting a C40 Climate Workshop for the Metro Vancouver Region
MOVED by Councillor Carr
SECONDED by Councillor Fry
WHEREAS
1. The City of Vancouver is a member of C40 Cities—a climate leadership group of
nearly 100 world-leading cities collaborating to deliver the urgent action needed
now to confront the climate crisis;
2. C40 Cities has a Center for City Climate Policy and Economy that provides city
policy makers and practitioners with information, analysis and policy guidance to
implement progressive and equitable climate action;
3. C40 Cities also has a Knowledge Hub that provides C40 cities with practical
resources on many topics including how to finance retrofits of municipal
buildings, how to adapt a city to extreme heat, and best practices such as for
clean energy, climate equity, and public collaboration and outreach;
4. Some C40 cities, such as Toronto and Montreal, have provided regional
leadership with C40 staff support, by mounting workshops and providing
resources and training within their regions to advance collaborative climate
action; and
5. Representatives of C40 Cities have pledged to provide training and resources on
climate action planning for Vancouver and any Metro Vancouver regional
participants invited by the city to a Vancouver-hosted workshop.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Vancouver City Council direct staff to
investigate, liaise with Metro Vancouver, and provide a memo to Council on the scope,
logistics and resources needed for Vancouver to host, as a C40 city, a C40-supported
workshop on accelerating local climate action plans.

4. Advocating for the Requirement of Side Guards on Heavy Trucks in Urban Areas
MOVED by Councillor Bligh
SECONDED by Councillor Boyle
WHEREAS
1. On June 29th, 28-year-old Vancouver resident and cyclist was tragically killed in
a collision with a semi-truck, who turned right while the cyclist was proceeding
straight through an intersection. Photographs of the scene, at the intersection of
Pacific and Hornby Street, show the bike fully underneath the truck, which did not
have side guards;
2. Truck side guards, or ‘lateral protection devices’ (LPD) are used to “reduce the
likelihood of injury to ‘unprotected road users’ when struck by a vehicle travelling
in a forward direction.”;2
3. The 2015 Canadian National Collision database suggests that 22% of fatalities
involving trucks and pedestrians or cyclists involve side impacts. In urban areas
like Vancouver, that rate is even higher. Many of these deaths could be avoided
by mandating the installation of side guards on large trucks. Side guards have
shown to be extremely effective at preventing fatalities and severe injuries
because they prevent cyclists and pedestrians from being trapped between the
truck’s wheels;
4. Truck side guards are mandatory throughout much of the world. The 2010
National Research Council Canada report “Side Guards for Trucks and Trailers”
concluded that European Union data demonstrated a reduction in deaths and
serious injuries following the introduction of side guards. In the UK, cyclist and
pedestrian fatalities dropped by 61 and 20 percent, respectively, when side
guards, front projection mirrors (“Class V”) and side close proximity mirrors
(“Class VI”) were made mandatory;3[2][5]
5. Mandating side guards on trucks falls under the jurisdiction of Transport Canada,
in its oversight capacity over motor vehicle safety regulations. Transport Canada
does not currently require side guards on large, heavy and semi-trucks;
6. A US National Transportation Safety Board study in 2014 found that side guards
could mitigate 9 of 10 injuries in side collisions;4
7. Side guards have been required in Europe since 1989, and are also mandatory
in Japan, China, Brazil and a number of cities throughout the United States;
8. Section 7.04 of the BC Motor Vehicle Act already requires vehicles to have
mirrors giving a rear view of the highway as well as mirrors with a view of the
adjacent lanes from 11m to 61m behind the vehicle. Large vehicles and trucks
with standard mirrors continue to have large blind spots at the front and

immediate side of the vehicles where cyclists and pedestrians can be present
and vulnerable;
9. There have been accidents across Canada similar to the June 29th in recent
years, including Ottawa and Montreal in 2016, with Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson
writing to Transport Canada to advocate for the recommended requirement of
side guards;
10. Municipalities can improve safety for vulnerable road users by mandating side
guards on city-owned vehicles. The Halifax Regional Council voted in June 2016
to require side guards on all City trucks and all trucks contracted by the City by
2022.5 Municipal action on lateral side guards could prevent tragedies happening
in our city in the future; and
11. The City of Vancouver’s Climate Emergency Action Plan aims to have 2/3 of all
trips in Vancouver be by active transportation and public transportation by 2030.
The City’s of Vancouver’s Transportation 2040 Plan also includes a goal of zero
traffic related fatalities, with an emphasis on vulnerable road users. Encouraging
more residents to walk, roll and cycle will reduce congestion and reduce carbon
pollution, but we need to make these options safer for everyone.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Vancouver City Council require that side guards be installed on all City of
Vancouver and City contracted trucks, to reduce the potential danger to cyclists
and pedestrians within the City’s own fleet of vehicles, and direct staff to report
back with recommendations and a timeline for implementation;
FURTHER THAT Council direct staff to consider the potential of adding side
mirrors on all City of Vancouver and City contracted trucks, giving the driver a
better view of cyclists and pedestrians around their vehicles, and direct staff to
report back with recommendations and a timeline for implementation.
B. THAT Council direct staff to institute a review of traffic planning in areas where
right hand turns intercept with bike lanes at intersections, to ensure that hazards
and dangerous interactions between vehicles and cyclists are mitigated, and
come back with recommendations to council by Q1 2023.
C. THAT Council direct the Mayor to write a letter to the federal Minister of
Transport, the Honourable Omar Alghabra, calling for the federal government to
make side guards mandatory on large, heavy and semi-trucks in urban areas.
D. THAT Council advocate to the Federation of Canadian Municipalities (FCM) to
adopt a resolution asking Transport Canada to make side guards mandatory on
large, heavy and semi-trucks in urban areas.

5. Asking Staff to Put Money for a Seniors’ Planner in the Draft 2023 Budget
MOVED by Councillor Boyle
SECONDED by Councillor Swanson
WHEREAS
1. Currently in the City of Vancouver based on 2021 Census data, 29.7% of the
population of the City of Vancouver are 55 years and older, 23% are 60 years
and older, and 17% are 65 years and older;
2. Based on CMHC data (2016) over 50% of all older adults who are renters are in
core housing need. The City of Vancouver’s Homelessness Services outreach
team has seen an increase in the number and percentage of seniors (aged 65+)
that staff work with to access a number of services such as access to health
supports, income, and appropriate housing. The City of Vancouver Renter's
Office staff also hear concerns of low-income senior renters, particularly those
facing growing health issues, being able to keep their housing;
3. Stats Canada has estimated that by 2046 the population of the older adults and
elders age 85 and above will triple. With more seniors living to 85 and beyond, an
increasing number of individuals will face limitations and long-term health
challenges. Older persons can face unique barriers to civic participation such as
health limitations, mobility challenges, and cognitive decline. This will put
increasing pressure on all levels of government to ensure adequate support, in
areas such as housing, health care and home care, as well as transportation,
among other things. These barriers put older persons at increased risk of
experiencing social isolation, loneliness, and economic vulnerability. This is an
important part of creating “complete communities” and ensuring there are
adequate programs and services to better address the needs and interests of an
ageing population;

Council Meeting
Minutes, July 19, 2022 34
4. Recent health and climate emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and
the heat dome, have disproportionately impacted older persons. These crises
have highlighted the seriousness and urgency of addressing existing gaps in
policies, systems, housing, community services and programs to prevent further
devastating impacts on many people living in the city, including on older persons;
5. Older adults face much higher levels of social isolation and homelessness than
the general population. Given the diversity and intersectional nature of older
adults and Elders, that in addition to their experience of system-based and
individual-based discrimination given their ethno-cultural, racial, gender, sexual
orientation, lower income levels and health challenges they also face the added
burden of ageism which is pervasive across society;
6. The World Health Organization has declared 2021-2030 as the Decade of
Healthy Ageing and has incorporated additional metrics under the Healthy Cities
strategy toward improving quality of life specifically for older persons (mitigation
of poverty, food security, expand opportunities for civic engagement,
opportunities for lifelong learning, age and gender equality, job opportunities,
internet access and digital support, housing, etc.). New metrics have not been
updated in the City of Vancouver’s commitment to the City of Vancouver’s
Healthy City Strategy;
7. The Seniors’ Advisory Committee has conducted a jurisdictional scan of major
urban centres across Canada, and has found:
i. The City of Richmond with the co-ordination of a full-time dedicated seniors’
co-ordinator is in the final stages of a public review of a community-informed
Seniors Strategy 2022–2032 and is seeking final input from adults aged 55
years and over, their families and those who work with the 55+ population. All
Seniors’ related queries, requests, complaints are directed to the Program
Lead of Seniors Services which has created efficiencies in both outreach and
internal communication;
ii. The City of Ottawa, using a team approach, created a community-informed
two year 2020-2022 Older Adult Plan that includes 24 actions across
different domains (Public Transportation, Walkability and Pedestrian Safety,
Accessibility of Public Spaces, Healthy Ageing, Active Living, Respect and
Social Inclusion) listing lead department and assisting department leads, and
reporting indicators. The City of Ottawa holds regular cross-department
meetings to collaborate and review progress;
iii. The City of Toronto using a comprehensive cross-department team approach
is completing Toronto Seniors Strategy (TSS2.0), with 27 high-impact
community-informed recommendations (accountability leads in each
department) that built upon the original Seniors Strategy to improve the
wellbeing of seniors throughout Toronto. The domains of action in the TSS2.0
are: Transportation, Housing, Health, Employment and Income, and Access
to Information. Outcomes are monitored by the Toronto Seniors Strategy
Accountability Table, consisting of multi-sector stakeholder group focused on
seniors and aging which includes seniors, caregivers, community agencies,

Council Meeting
Minutes, July 19, 2022 35
advocacy, equity and diversity organizations, academic and research
partners, community funders, provincial and federal partners, local
businesses, school boards, hospitals, long-term care homes, and the Toronto
Central Local Health Integration Network. Annually the TSS2.0 co-chairs
publishes status updates to Council and the public. This complements other
landmark initiatives including the establishment of a Seniors Housing
Corporation, the creation of a new Integrated Service Model in TCHC seniors
buildings, improved information-sharing and access to services, a focus on
understanding the specific needs of Black and Indigenous seniors and Elders
and other racialized and equity-deserving groups, and services provided by
divisional partners across the City including dental care, funding to seniors
organizations, older adult recreation, etc. [Note the formal engagement of
federal and provincial stakeholders in planning and monitoring outcomes
facilitates buy-in and investment.];
iv. The City of Edmonton co-funds ($600K of 1 million budget) the Edmonton
Seniors Coordinating Council (ESCC), co-funds with the province a Family
and Community Support Services Liaison (0.5 FTE dedicated to Seniors) to
address (a) Mobility including built environments and accessibility; (b) age-
friendly lens; (c) social work lens; (d) the physical build of seniors’ centres.
The city also dedicates time for a Community Strategic Planning Analyst to
this portfolio. The ED of the ESCC, Family and Community Support Liaison
and Community Strategic Planning Analyst have regular meetings to plan and
address this portfolio. Currently the City of Edmonton are completing Phase II
of implementing cross-department initiatives to support healthy ageing;
8. 35 senior serving community organizations and four advisory committees
supported the January 27th council motion seeking staff support for a seniors
planner;
9. To date there has been no update, possibly as a result of limited staff time and
provisos to not interrupt other social equity initiatives in place indicating that
budget and resources need to be place to advance efforts to address the diverse
unmet needs and interests of older adults and elders; and
10. The Seniors’ Advisory Committee have asked Councillors Boyle and Swanson,
as their Council liaison’s, to bring this motion forward.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council request that City staff meet with
representatives from the Seniors' Advisory Committee, Persons with Disabilities
Advisory Committee, Racial and Ethno-Cultural Equity Advisory Committee, Women’s
Advisory Committee, Urban Indigenous Peoples Advisory Committee and 2SLGBTQ+
Advisory Committee for input, and prepare options for a budget item for a planner for
older persons and necessary resources for that planner, and that this budget item be in
the draft 2023 budget prepared for council’s consideration.

6. Making It Easier to Host Outdoor Festivals and Events in Vancouver
MOVED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
SECONDED by Councillor Fry
WHEREAS
1. Outdoor festivals and events give people the opportunity to join together and
enjoy our locals arts, culture and celebrations, adding fun and vibrancy to city life;
2. The ability to gather and connect socially outdoors has become even more
valued as a result of the pandemic;
3. Groups and organizations wanting to host outdoor festivals in the City of
Vancouver, on a street, sidewalk, or plaza, are required to apply for approval;
4. The focus of event approvals is to ensure that events are safe and don’t
negatively affect the community, but in recent years it has become increasingly
challenging for festivals and events to navigate the City’s permitting processes.
Event hosts typically find the City’s regulations to be unwieldy and it takes an
undue length of time before a permit can be successfully obtained. Some
improvements are being made this year with the adoption of the Special Events
Policy, but more streamlining and simplification is needed and will be beneficial
to supporting local arts and culture in the city;
5. Costs for festivals and events have also been increasing due to increasing
policing costs and safety requirements, making it difficult for established festivals
to sustain and difficult for new and smaller events to be staged;
6. For events held in a Vancouver park, the oversight for granting approval falls
to the Vancouver Park Board. The Vancouver Park Board currently has a
moratorium on issuing permits for corporate events in parks, resulting in
tourism operators taking client groups to other municipalities to hold
conferences or events for visiting client;
7. There is a shortage of venues for local, live music for the public to enjoy and
for local musicians to play small, pop-up events; and
8. Festivals and events are key contributors to Vancouver’s economic health,
generating jobs and tax revenue.

Council Meeting
Minutes, July 19, 2022 37
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to report back in Q2, 2023 on options for a more
streamlined Festivals and Events permitting process to reduce the amount of
time it takes to issue permits by reducing the complexity of applications and
giving consideration to separate permitting streams for smaller and larger events,
with a special focus on reducing barriers for music and arts related events, and
consideration to having one event policy that spans both public and private
property to help reduce red tape;
FURTHER THAT the report back should include any recommended
improvements and updates to the City’s Special Events Policy and any
associated guidelines.
B. THAT Council direct staff to engage with the VPD to review opportunities to
reduce on-site policing requirements and costs borne by organizers while still
maintaining regard for public safety, including the possible increased use of
private security and/or other measures to combat the increasing safety costs
impacting the viability of public festivals and events.
C. THAT Council direct staff to convene an Advisory Task Force comprised of a
range of representatives and stakeholders from Vancouver’s Festival and Events
sector including small and large event organizers, cultural and music sector
stakeholders, and groups such as business improvement associations, in order
to help identify key challenges and opportunities with the current festivals and
events permitting processes, and that the engagement and feedback gathered
help inform the above-noted report back.

MOVED by Councillor Wiebe
SECONDED by Councillor Dominato
WHEREAS
1. Waters in and around Vancouver play an important role in the economic,
ecological and social well-being of Vancouver;

Council Meeting
Minutes, July 19, 2022 38
2. Aquatic programming promotes both mental and physical fitness as well as
safety and security in and around the water. A current lack of accredited guards
and limited aquatic access has prevented the next generation of children from
learning basic swim skills. While long term solutions are explored there are steps
we can take to immediately help relieve some of the issues;
3. Climate change is amplifying the negative impacts of biological and toxic
pollutions yet Vancouver has had success restoring creeks, rivers and habitat
that has brought salmon and herring back;
4. On May 30, 2017, Council passed a motion to establish a Waterfront Initiative for
major natural waterways including the Burrard Inlet, False Creek, Lost Lagoon,
the Fraser River and Trout Lake that engages First Nations, industry, senior
levels of government and adjacent municipalities, and the community to support
multiple goals: A Thriving Working Waterfront, Safe Accessible Waterfront
Recreation, Restoring Aquatic and Riparian Ecology and Traditional First
Nation’s Food Sources; and
5. On May 2nd, Council approved the recommendation in RTS # 11851 “Update on
Protecting Vancouver's Recreational Water Quality” which identified proposed
activities and by-law amendments to strengthen water quality protection.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to work with First Nations,
Vancouver Coastal Health and the Vancouver Park Board on a report back to council on
the feasibility and financial costing to restore sections of Coal Harbour, False Creek,
Trout Lake, downtown waterfront, New Brighton and the Fraser River to primary contact
recreational water bodies by Vancouver Coastal Health standards, which would allow
more equitable access to natural aquatic spaces throughout Vancouver;

8. Enabling the Next Generation of Vancouver Specials
MOVED by Councillor Wiebe
SECONDED by Councillor Dominato
WHEREAS
1. Vancouver currently has a housing affordability and climate crisis;
2. Buildings are a significant contributor to the climate crisis, as buildings and
construction account for 39% of global energy-related carbon dioxide emissions
and 21% of total GHG emissions in BC as per the 2020 CleanBC Climate
Change Accountability Report;
3. The CMHC 2022 Housing Supply Report highlighted the need for Vancouver to
innovate and diversify new housing to provide adequate new supply that is
affordable to a wider range of households, in terms of built-form,
location/geography and tenure;
4. The Vancouver Heritage Foundation states that “The Vancouver Special is the
only house style that developed in Greater Vancouver from 1965-85, found
nowhere else. They were a response to a City of Vancouver by-law change to
address the need for more housing. As a result, the design of the Special
maximized the square footage of a home on the narrow lots of the city at a low
cost. This made them very widespread. The plans were particularly popular with
multi-generational households”;
5. The Vancouver Special Competition of 1985 highlighted the benefits of the
original “Vancouver Special” including short permit times (2 to 3 days), simplified
labour needs, standardized local materials, and shorter building timelines which
benefited tenants and small builders;
6. A catalogue of next generation Vancouver Special houses could be created with
pre-approved building forms that allow for an expedited permitting and
construction process – a repeatable house that meets net zero energy and
universal design standards, is constructed with wood and modular prefabrication
by way of social employment and local procurement and operates with 100%
renewable sources of energy; and
7. A pilot version of a next generation Vancouver Special could be designed by City
of Vancouver architects and designers for a backyard mini modular Accessory
Dwelling Unit (ADU), which BC Housing refers to as all forms of additional units
on residential (or even commercial/industrial) properties which could be scaled
up.

Council Meeting
Minutes, July 19, 2022 40
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to report back on a pathway
for an expedited building permit and construction process for a new generation of
Vancouver Specials (repeatable building forms) from a modular Tiny Home (ADU) to a
multifamily building that would deliver diverse spaces for multigenerational living as easy
as a single family home to tackle the climate and affordability crisis head-on.
