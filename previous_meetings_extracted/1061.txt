The Panel also had before it a transcription submitted by the lawyer for the Licencee, from
the Provincial Court of British Columbia, dated March 9, 2018, File No.: 243953-1, entitled
“Regina v. Van De Nguyen – Reasons for Sentence of the Honourable Judge Denhoff”.
Iain Dixon, Assistant Director – Regulatory Litigation, Legal Department, was present on behalf
of the City of Vancouver. Tony Lagemaat, Lawyer, was present on behalf of Van De Nguyen
(the Licencee). Mr. Nguyen was also assisted by Vietnamese interpreter Anna Diep Dao.
At the commencement of proceedings, Mr. Dixon advised this appeal had been brought before
the Council pursuant to Section 275 of the Vancouver Charter, and noted Council’s
discretionary powers to uphold or overturn the decision of the Deputy Chief Licence Inspector to
revoke the Business Licence issued to Van De Nguyen (the “Licencee”) for the business
premises located at 2234 Kingsway, Vancouver, British Columbia (the “Premises”), as set out in
Section 4.(4) of Licence By-law 4450. Mr. Dixon also discussed the principles of natural justice,
in particular the requirements of notice and the opportunity to be heard.
Mr. Dixon referred the Panel to the reasons for the Deputy Chief Licence Inspector’s
recommendation to revoke the Business Licence issued to Van De Nguyen, as set out in the
Notice of Hearing dated April 3, 2018. Specifically, the Deputy Chief Licence Inspector
recommended the Business Licence be revoked on the fact that:

Minutes, Tuesday, April 24, 2018 3
1. the Licencee has had interactions with the Vancouver Police Department in
relation to stolen retail items; and
2. the Deputy Chief Licence Inspector is of the belief that the Licencee is guilty of
gross misconduct in the management of the business.
In support of the allegations set out in the above-noted reports and evidence, Mr. Dixon called
Sarah Hicks, Deputy Chief Licence Inspector, as witness.
Mr. Dixon, the Panel and Mr. Lagemaat directed questions to the City’s witness.
Mr. Lagemaat submitted opening remarks, questioned the reliability of the allegations, and
noted the financial hardship that losing the business licence would have on Mr. Nguyen’s family.
He also submitted that in the transcription, Judge Denhoff had expressed her satisfaction that
this experience has been a learning lesson for Mr. Nguyen. He requested that Mr. Nguyen be
able to continue operating his business until his retirement.
The Panel directed questions to the Licence Applicant via Mr. Lagemaat.
Mr. Dixon provided closing comments and noted that in the transcription, Judge Denhoff
had suggested that as part of Mr. Nguyen’s punishment for the crimes he had been convicted
for, City Council would likely be in agreement with the Deputy Chief Licence Inspector’s
recommendation to revoke his business licence.
Mr. Lagemaat provided closing comments.
