Iain Dixon, Assistant Director – Regulatory Litigation, Legal Department, was present on
behalf of the City of Vancouver. Tony Lagemaat and Sandy Ross of Johnson Doyle Sugarman
and Ferguson, were present on behalf of Van De Nguyen (the Licencee). Anna Diep Dao, a
Vietnamese interpreter, was also in attendance to provide interpretation services for
Mr. Nguyen.
At the commencement of proceedings, Mr. Dixon advised this appeal had been brought before
the Council pursuant to Section 278 of the Vancouver Charter, and noted Council’s discretion
to uphold or overturn the decision of the Deputy Chief Licence Inspector to revoke the 2017
Business Licence issued to Mr. Nguyen, as per Section 275 of the Vancouver Charter.
In his opening remarks, Mr. Ross advised that due to criminal charges against Mr. Nguyen as a
result of a police investigation, the evidentiary matters would be tested before a Provincial
Court judge, and therefore, Mr. Ross made application to postpone this hearing pending
Mr. Nguyen’s criminal trial set in Provincial Court for the period, February 5 – 8, 2018.
In response to questions from the Panel, Mr. Dixon advised that the decision to adjourn the
hearing pending the outcome of Mr. Nguyen’s trial, is open to the Panel to consider, but
cautioned the business has been open for a considerable period of time since the allegations.

Mr. Dixon further advised that an acquittal in the Provincial court would not resolve the issue
from the City’s point of view and not necessarily dispose of it entirely. It is likely the Panel
would have to adjudicate on the same evidentiary issues at some point in time. A conviction,
however, would resolve the issue entirely because the Licence By-law states that a licence
would not be issued to an applicant who has a criminal conviction that relates to the business
within the preceeding 5 years.
Mr. Dixon recommended that if the inclination of the Panel members is to await the outcome
of the Provincial criminal trial, then a specific business licence hearing date be set in the
motion.
