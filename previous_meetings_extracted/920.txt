the project in light of concerns raised by the Hospice and supporters.
Brent Toderian, Toderian UrbanWORKS, noted he was asked quite recently to do an
inependent review of all information related to the development and presented the results of his
view, noting that this area is good for higher density due to existing transit infrastructure and that
the design is well done in terms of how it interfaces with the area.
Virginia Bird, Pottinger-Bird Community Relations, provided an overview of public outreach done
since 2017, noted recent feedback is mostly balanced, and indicated the developer remains
committed to working with the Hospice and neighbours to address their concerns.
Neil Robertson, Principal, Stuart Howard Architects Inc., provided a detailed overview of the
application, noting the ways in which the original proposal the project had changed due to
concerns raised by the Hospice and neighbours. He also noted they are committed to working
with the hospice and neighbours to address as many of their concerns as possible.
