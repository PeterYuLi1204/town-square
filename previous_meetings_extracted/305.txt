SECONDED by Councillor Carr
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. The City of Vancouver has committed to “Vision Zero”, an approach to ending the
epidemic of traffic fatalities and serious injuries, while increasing safe, healthy,
equitable mobility for all;
2. ICBC data shows that in the City of Vancouver during the period of 2018-2022
there were 41,096 casualty crashes (crashes resulting in injury or fatality, as
opposed to crashes involving just property damage), which is 8,219 per year or
22 per day;
3. In 2021 over 7,300 people in Vancouver were treated in hospital for injuries
sustained in motor vehicle crashes, and 18 people were killed;
4. Vulnerable road users suffer disproportionate adverse consequences from motor
vehicle collisions. In Vancouver, people walking and cycling represent over 50%
of all motor vehicle-related serious injuries and fatalities, and senior citizens
represent 45%;
5. The direct hospitalization costs of motor vehicle collisions in BC average
$504,142 for a fatality, $26,026 for a non-fatal hospital admission, and $2,367 for
an emergency department visit. Therefore using 2021 Vancouver crash statistics,
the direct annual cost resulting from motor vehicle incidents was $33.6 million, or
$92,000 per day; with the social cost of a fatal crash estimated at over $8.1
million per incident;
6. The Government of BC’s Road Safety BC website states that:
a. “Most crashes in British Columbia happen at intersections. To reduce
injuries and save lives, B.C. installs intersection safety cameras—
sometimes called red light cameras—at intersections where crashes
occur frequently. Warning signs let drivers know the intersection has
cameras. Stopping for red lights and observing the speed limits help to
reduce collisions, injuries and fatalities”;
b. “The cameras are proven to be effective at reducing side-impact, head-on
and pedestrian crashes, and are located where red light running and high
speed cause serious crashes”;

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, November 01, 2023 13
7. “Studies have also shown speed cameras to rank among the most cost-effective
interventions, with some reports demonstrating estimated benefit-cost ratios
exceeding 10:1”;
8. Speed was the number one contributing factor in fatal crashes in BC and in the
Lower Mainland between 2018 and 2022, and speed is the fundamental factor
contributing to injury severity;
9. There are currently 43 traffic cameras in the City of Vancouver, of which 12
capture both red light and speed violations, and 31 monitor red light violations
only. These cameras have generated an average of $8.2 million in annual
revenue;
10. Victoria City Council recently unanimously approved a motion requesting that the
Province install speed and red light cameras at all intersections with 20 or more
casualty crashes between 2018-2022, or that the Province allow BC
municipalities to install speed and red light cameras at their own cost and collect
fines;
11. The City of Vancouver has been working toward our Vision Zero commitment
through a variety of initiatives and infrastructure improvements. However these
efforts have been slow and there continues to be a significant backlog of
requests for road safety improvements in neighbourhoods across Vancouver,
including requests from Parent Advisory Councils for improvements to road
safety around schools. The speed at which Vancouver implements these
requests is slowed by a limited amount of capital budget funding and staff
resources directed toward neighbourhood road safety;
12. Speed and red light cameras can be quickly implemented. Along with the primary
goal of reducing motor vehicle speeds and reducing preventable injuries and
deaths, revenue from these cameras can be directed toward road safety
initiatives such as addressing the backlog of neighbourhood road safety
infrastructure requests, including pedestrian-controlled crossing signals, safer
crosswalks, flashing beacons, and sidewalk upgrades that improve safety for
vulnerable road users;
13. Traffic safety cameras are a complement to, and not a replacement of, traditional
police enforcement, enabling police officers to focus on other critical and time-
sensitive tasks;
14. Working to eliminate traffic fatalities and severe injuries by reducing motor
vehicle speed and investing in safer streets will make Vancouver safer, healthier,
and more equitable for residents and visitors of all ages and abilities;
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Vancouver City Council direct the Mayor to write a letter to the Provincial
Government to request that the Provincial Government:

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, November 01, 2023 14
a. Install additional speed and red light intersection safety cameras in the
City of Vancouver, prioritizing:
i. Intersections with a high rate of crashes that resulted in injuries or
fatalities, and other risk data, in consultation with road safety
experts including at least intersections where there were more
than 100 such crashes between 2018 and 2022; and
ii. Intersections near schools with a high rate of crashes that resulted
in injuries or fatalities, including at least intersections where there
were more than 50 such crashes between 2018 and 2022;
b. Also allow BC local governments to install speed and red light cameras at
their own cost and collect fines; and
c. Provide all revenue from additional speed and red light cameras to
municipalities as grants to be invested in implementing road safety
improvements (such as flashing beacons, accessible pedestrian signals,
curb cuts, median extensions, modal filters, active mobility lanes, etc.).
B. THAT Vancouver City Council direct the Mayor to send this motion to other local
governments across BC and request that they write similar letters.
amended
AMENDMENT MOVED by Councillor Montague
SECONDED by Councillor Meiszner
THAT the following be added as clause “A” and subsequent clauses re-lettered:
“A. THAT Council direct staff to work with the VPD, ICBC, VFRS, VCH and
other stakeholders to identify high risk intersections in the city where
speed and red light cameras might be effective tools in preventing and/or
reducing injuries and fatalities, and for staff to report back by Q3 2024
with recommendations, including data and analysis related to specific
fatalities and injuries, the causes of these collisions, and any corrective
safety measures implemented subsequently;
FURTHER THAT staff be directed to include in their report and
recommendations information on opportunities to implement new and/or
alternative site-specific traffic safety measures, such as increasing the
number of Leading Pedestrian Interval (LPI) crosswalks, additional
advance turning signals, turning restrictions, traditional traffic
enforcement, and other solutions tailored to specific traffic contexts that
might prove to be a more effective and impactful investment of
resources.”;

FINAL MOTION AS APPROVED
WHEREAS
1. The City of Vancouver has committed to “Vision Zero”, an approach to ending the
epidemic of traffic fatalities and serious injuries, while increasing safe, healthy,
equitable mobility for all;
2. ICBC data shows that in the City of Vancouver during the period of 2018-2022
there were 41,096 casualty crashes (crashes resulting in injury or fatality, as
opposed to crashes involving just property damage), which is 8,219 per year or
22 per day;1
3. In 2021 over 7,300 people in Vancouver were treated in hospital for injuries
sustained in motor vehicle crashes, and 18 people were killed;2
4. Vulnerable road users suffer disproportionate adverse consequences from motor
vehicle collisions. In Vancouver, people walking and cycling represent over 50%
of all motor vehicle-related serious injuries and fatalities, and senior citizens
represent 45%;3
5. The direct hospitalization costs of motor vehicle collisions in BC average
$504,142 for a fatality, $26,026 for a non-fatal hospital admission, and $2,367 for
an emergency department visit4. Therefore using 2021 Vancouver crash
statistics, the direct annual cost resulting from motor vehicle incidents was $33.6

million, or $92,000 per day; with the social cost of a fatal crash estimated at over
$8.1 million per incident;5
6. The Government of BC’s Road Safety BC website states that:
a. “Most crashes in British Columbia happen at intersections. To reduce
injuries and save lives, B.C. installs intersection safety cameras—
sometimes called red light cameras—at intersections where crashes
occur frequently. Warning signs let drivers know the intersection has
cameras. Stopping for red lights and observing the speed limits help to
reduce collisions, injuries and fatalities”;6
b. “The cameras are proven to be effective at reducing side-impact, head-on
and pedestrian crashes, and are located where red light running and high
speed cause serious crashes”;7
7. “Studies have also shown speed cameras to rank among the most cost-effective
interventions, with some reports demonstrating estimated benefit-cost ratios
exceeding 10:1”;8
8. Speed was the number one contributing factor in fatal crashes in BC and in the
Lower Mainland between 2018 and 20229, and speed is the fundamental factor
contributing to injury severity;
9. There are currently 43 traffic cameras in the City of Vancouver, of which 12
capture both red light and speed violations, and 31 monitor red light violations
only. These cameras have generated an average of $8.2 million in annual
revenue;10
10. Victoria City Council recently unanimously approved a motion requesting that the
Province install speed and red light cameras at all intersections with 20 or more
casualty crashes between 2018-2022, or that the Province allow BC
municipalities to install speed and red light cameras at their own cost and collect
fines;11
11. The City of Vancouver has been working toward our Vision Zero commitment
through a variety of initiatives and infrastructure improvements. However these
efforts have been slow and there continues to be a significant backlog of
requests for road safety improvements in neighbourhoods across Vancouver,

Minutes, Wednesday, November 01, 2023 18
including requests from Parent Advisory Councils for improvements to road
safety around schools. The speed at which Vancouver implements these
requests is slowed by a limited amount of capital budget funding and staff
resources directed toward neighbourhood road safety;
12. Speed and red light cameras can be quickly implemented. Along with the primary
goal of reducing motor vehicle speeds and reducing preventable injuries and
deaths, revenue from these cameras can be directed toward road safety
initiatives such as addressing the backlog of neighbourhood road safety
infrastructure requests, including pedestrian-controlled crossing signals, safer
crosswalks, flashing beacons, and sidewalk upgrades that improve safety for
vulnerable road users;
13. Traffic safety cameras are a complement to, and not a replacement of, traditional
police enforcement, enabling police officers to focus on other critical and time
sensitive tasks;
14. Working to eliminate traffic fatalities and severe injuries by reducing motor
vehicle speed and investing in safer streets will make Vancouver safer, healthier,
and more equitable for residents and visitors of all ages and abilities;
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to work with the VPD, ICBC, VFRS, VCH and other
stakeholders to identify high risk intersections in the city where speed and red
light cameras might be effective tools in preventing and/or reducing injuries and
fatalities, and for staff to report back by Q3 2024 with recommendations,
including data and analysis related to specific fatalities and injuries, the causes of
these collisions, and any corrective safety measures implemented subsequently;
FURTHER THAT staff be directed to include in their report and recommendations
information on opportunities to implement new and/or alternative site-specific
traffic safety measures, such as increasing the number of Leading Pedestrian
Interval (LPI) crosswalks, additional advance turning signals, turning restrictions,
traditional traffic enforcement, and other solutions tailored to specific traffic
contexts that might prove to be a more effective and impactful investment of
resources.
B. THAT Vancouver City Council ask the Mayor to write correspondence to the
Provincial Government Ministers responsible for a) transportation and traffic to
consider:
a. Installing additional speed and red light intersection safety cameras in the
City of Vancouver at locations where these might prove to be the most
effective safety measure, for example:
i. Intersections with a high rate of crashes that resulted in injuries or
fatalities, including intersections where there were more than 100
such crashes between 2018 and 2022; and

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, November 01, 2023 19
ii. Intersections near schools with a high rate of crashes that resulted
in injuries or fatalities, including intersections where there were
more than 50 such crashes between 2018 and 2022;
b. Also allow BC local governments to install speed and red light cameras at
their own cost and collect fines;
c. Allow all revenue from additional speed and red light cameras to
municipalities as grants to be invested in implementing road safety
improvements (such as flashing beacons, accessible pedestrian signals,
curb cuts, median extensions, modal filters, active mobility lanes, etc.).
C. THAT Council ask the Mayor to write a letter to UBCM encouraging them to
advocate for increased traffic safety measures in collaboration with the Province
to reduce pedestrian and traffic injuries and fatalities.
3. Advancing Britannia Renewal
The Committee heard from 16 speakers in support of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Fry
SECONDED by Councillor Carr
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. The Britannia Community Services Centre (BCSC) is a 17+ acre site completed
in 1976, combining the original 1911-built Britannia Secondary as a Community
School incorporating Britannia Elementary, and an integrated community centre
including an ice rink, swimming pool, assorted recreational and social
programming, and a Vancouver Public Library. The Vancouver School Board
owns 70% of the BCSC site and the City owns 30% of the site.
2. The Centre serves some of the City’s most at-risk communities in Grandview
Woodland and Strathcona/Kiwassa. These neighbourhoods relative to the rest of
the City have higher rates of low incomes, the lowest median incomes, high rates
of early childhood vulnerability, and a significant number of low income seniors
including those with limited English language skills. The neighbourhoods are also
noted for cultural diversity with significant numbers of refugees and new
Canadians, and both the city’s largest urban indigenous population and arts and
culture workforce.
3. By the late 1990’s the Britannia Centre had begun to show its age, deficiencies
and deterioration. Led by the BCSC Society and community, a needs
assessment in 2005 inspired a Facilities Master Plan in 2007, and culminated in
a 2011 Strategic Master Plan. The 2011 Master Plan suggested a new pool
facility, integrated service delivery, and arts and culture programming, but was
not funded in the City of Vancouver’s Capital Plan of that same year.

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, November 01, 2023 20
4. Capital Funding for Britannia Renewal planning was approved by voters in 2014,
with the Renewal project itself expected to span three four-year capital budgets.
Planning for the Britannia Renewal helped inform the 2016 Grandview Woodland
Community Plan. In 2018, the Britannia Renewal Masterplan was approved
unanimously by Council following in-depth community consultation and extensive
work with partners including the City of Vancouver, Vancouver Board of Parks
and Recreation, Vancouver School Board, Vancouver Public Library, and
Britannia Community Services Centre Society.
5. The vision for Britannia Renewal is inclusive, community-driven, and
strengthened by innovative partnerships to create an integrated hub of education,
arts, culture, recreation, wellness, and sustainability. The project contemplates
renewed and reimagined rink and aquatic facilities, with recreation, library, arts
and culture, social development, indigenous space, food hub, education and non-
market housing.
6. Future population growth and needs that would be met by Britannia Renewal are
suggested by new development proposed for the area, including approved below
market rental, supportive, and social housing as well as increased density
contemplated along the Hastings Corridor and Broadway Station areas as part of
the DTES Local Area Plan (2014), Grandview Woodland Community Plan
(2016), and emerging direction from the Vancouver Plan.
7. The 2018 capital plan commitment to a twelve year phased renewal has not yet
delivered re-zoning or new construction, and currently the necessary funding for
future phases, including construction, is unavailable.
8. The City of Vancouver’s capital planning dedicates significant funding to building
new and renewing ageing amenities and infrastructure, including parks and
community facilities such as recreation centres, and libraries, municipal facilities,
affordable housing, public safety facilities, and more. Capital funding sources
include City contributions (via property tax, user fees and parking revenue),
Development contributions, and Partner contributions including other
governments.
9. The Britannia deficiencies and deterioration identified twenty-five years ago have
become even more urgent. In summer 2023 partners shifted funding and
planning from renewal, to assessing and advancing critical maintenance and
repair needs for existing facilities at Britannia and prioritizing that work, in order
to ensure that the facilities can continue to serve the community.
10. Work and planning done so far in collaboration and good faith with community
and partners will be essential for any future implementation, noting that there is
currently no timing, phasing, or funding for a future Britannia Renewal.
11. The City of Vancouver is committed to advancing reconciliation, equity, and anti-
racism, for a fairer, safer, more inclusive city, upholding the rights and dignity of
all people, addressing historic, current systemic injustice, and reducing harm for
all people in Vancouver.

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, November 01, 2023 21
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council affirms its commitment to advancing Britannia Renewal planning
and the vision developed collaboratively by community and partners to date, as
necessary to the health, equity and growth of Grandview Woodland and
Strathcona/Kiwassa area, for consideration in future Capital Plans;
FURTHER THAT, notwithstanding the commitment to Britannia Renewal
planning, Council recognizes the need to prioritize available funding toward
critical maintenance and repair needs at Britannia;
AND FURTHER THAT Council affirms City of Vancouver’s commitment to
working with Vancouver Board of Parks and Recreation, Vancouver School
Board, Vancouver Public Library, and Britannia Community Services Centre
Society (BCSCS) to achieve the Britannia Renewal goals.
B. THAT Council direct staff to report back in Q2 2024 in the context of new
Britannia infrastructure priorities and available funding, with revised high level
plans for:
i. Potential re-phasing and/or reconfiguration of Britannia Renewal as currently
contemplated;
ii. Potential re-phasing and/or reconfiguration of Britannia Renewal that could
be incorporated into committed repair and maintenance of existing facilities;
iii. Funding needs, targets and sources, including other orders of government
and public benefit contributions from current contemplated zoned capacity or
a new zoned capacity of local development on site, adjacent to the site, and
in the catchment area;
iv. Timelines and targets for a renewed or potentially reconfigured Britannia
Renewal plan;
v. Considerations around interest and participation of Vancouver School Board
and Vancouver Board of Parks and Recreation.
C. THAT Council direct staff to engage with Provincial partners including but not
limited to Ministries of Finance, Housing, Children and Family Development,
Education and Childcare, Municipal Affairs, Social Development and Poverty
Reduction, and Britannia-adjacent MLAs, as well as area-adjacent MPs and the
Investing in Canada Infrastructure Program and Pacific Economic Development
Canada program for funding opportunities and potential partnerships to prioritize
and advance the Britannia Renewal.
