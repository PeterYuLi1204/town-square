2. Housing is Healthcare
The Committee heard from five speakers in support of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Fry
SECONDED by Councillor Carr
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. In Canada, the right to adequate housing is a fundamental human right, and all
residents of a province or territory are entitled, on uniform terms and conditions,
to the publicly funded health services covered by provincial/territorial plans.
2. Every year hundreds of British Columbians are diagnosed with chronic conditions
and diseases including cancers, organ, and stem transplants that necessitate
specialized medical treatment requiring long term stays near, but not in hospital.
3. In 2022, there were 465 organ transplants in BC, 34% of those transplant
patients were from outside of the Fraser and Vancouver Coastal Health
Authorities, and 100% of those transplants occurred in Vancouver. Over the
course of their treatment, the typical transplant patient is required to stay near,
but not in hospital for three months. 1

Minutes, Wednesday, February 07, 2024 6
4. In BC, urban centres typically provide high acuity care for regional patients, and
Vancouver with its major medical centres at BC Children’s Hospital, Vancouver
General Hospital and St Paul’s Hospital respectively provide complex and highly
specialized treatment for the entire Province. High acuity cases and procedures
like transplantation will often require patients to travel with very little advance
notice or planning.
5. There exists significant challenges to securing accommodations near, but not in
hospital for British Columbians needing to travel to Vancouver for specialized
medical treatment. Challenges are variously exacerbated by: low vacancy rates
and housing unaffordability; changes to short term rental legislation; hotel room
shortages; and development related pressures in hospital adjacent areas like the
Broadway Plan, Cambie Corridor, and new St Paul's Campus. These challenges
can create significant barriers to timely treatment, causing patients stress and
anxiety. In some cases, patients are reported to forgo treatment for want of
secure affordable accommodations.
6. In 2023, delegates overwhelming supported UBCM Resolution SR1 “Health
Equity for Rural and Remote Communities” calling on the Province to:
• Identify reasonable travel distances from each community to health care
services and facilities, to ensure transparent, accountable, and equitable
health care access for those living in rural and remote communities in BC;
and
• Conduct a thorough policy review and reform to ensure equitable healthcare
access for all residents of British Columbia, in compliance with the Canada
Health Act; and
• Collaborate with healthcare providers, patient advocacy groups, and other
stakeholders to gather data, improve service delivery, and address systemic
healthcare challenges in rural and remote areas.
7. Many jurisdictions with universal healthcare provide subsidies for travel and
accommodation. Ontario, for example provides the Transplant Patient Expense
Reimbursement (TPER) Program2 and up to $2,500/month for accommodation.
Similar programs have been replicated in Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia,
New Brunswick, Nunavut, Yukon and Newfoundland and Labrador.
8. Many jurisdictions with universal healthcare provide subsidized accommodation
options. Australia for example variously provides Medihotels3 and Red Cross
Medical Accommodations4 with low cost accommodation, minimal patient
supervision, and support and facilities for patients, a family member or carer, for
self-caring patients including rural patients who require short-stay
accommodation.

Minutes, Wednesday, February 07, 2024 7
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
THAT Council direct staff to consider, in the course of area planning and regular
rezoning and permit applications, opportunities where density bonusing and similar
incentives could stimulate the creation of housing and accommodations for patients
needing to travel to major medical centres in Vancouver for longer-term specialized
medical treatment near but not in hospital;
FURTHER THAT Council direct staff to share with relevant authorities in the Provincial
Ministries of Health and Housing respectively, the substance of this motion and City’s
willingness to consider the needs of British Columbians requiring longer-term
accommodations for specialized medical treatment, in our planning and permitting
processes, especially in transit-oriented areas adjacent and proximate to major medical
centres including BC Children’s Hospital, Vancouver General Hospital and the new St
Paul’s Campus;
AND FURTHER THAT the following be submitted to the Lower Mainland Local
Government Association for consideration as a resolution at the Union of BC
Municipalities 2024 Convention, with the above whereas clauses submitted as
background:
Housing is Healthcare
WHEREAS every year hundreds of British Columbians are diagnosed with chronic
conditions and diseases that necessitate specialized medical treatment requiring
long term stays near but not in hospital, there are disparities in health outcomes
between rural and urban patients;
AND WHEREAS residents of rural and remote communities in British Columbia
requiring specialized medical treatment for complex care in urban centres face
significant challenges including high travel and accommodation costs, the
psychosocial impacts of healthcare away from home and community, the loss of
income during treatment period, and increasingly limited availability of affordable
accommodations, hotel rooms, or short term rentals;
AND WHEREAS the Province of British Columbia, reflected in its 2024 mandate, is
committed to both improved health care for British Columbians when they need it,
and attainable and affordable housing to deliver more homes for people faster:
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that the UBCM advocate for the Provincial
Government of British Columbia to alleviate the financial and logistical burdens
associated with seeking specialized medical care far from home by developing and
implementing comprehensive policies and programs to assist patients needing to
travel for healthcare, and ensure that patients have access to affordable,
comfortable, and convenient accommodations.
AND BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that UBCM request the Province consider and
implement ways to deliver and dedicate subsidized accommodations in and adjacent
to large urban health centres specifically purposed for longer term specialized
medical treatment.
