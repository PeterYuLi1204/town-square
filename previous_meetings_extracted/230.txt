2. Taking Action to Protect and Expand Arts and Culture Spaces
The Committee heard from five speakers who spoke in support of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Boyle
SECONDED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. Arts and culture are important to Vancouver’s vibrancy, identity, quality of life,
economic prosperity, social cohesion, and sustainability;
2. The most critical challenge facing arts and culture is affordability of, and access
to, space. New developments and rapidly rising industrial and commercial land
values, coupled with many arts and culture spaces currently existing in older
buildings within these zonings, means Vancouver is facing an imminent loss of
affordable places for artists to live, work, and share their work. Since 2010 more
than 400 artist production spaces, music and performing arts venues, and art
galleries in Vancouver have closed;
3. The affordability crisis coupled with a complex regulatory environment can push
arts and cultural activities underground or can make permitting and development
of arts and culture spaces seem insurmountable for artists and non-profit
organizations;
4. Arts and culture spaces sometimes require specific technical requirements (i.e.
high ceilings to hang lighting grids, sprung floors, accessible seating, adequate
ventilation) that may make finding and modifying space more difficult for artists to
navigate;
5. In 2019, Vancouver City Council unanimously approved Making Space for Arts
and Culture: Vancouver Cultural Infrastructure Plan, which “examines in depth
the current state of Vancouver’s arts and cultural spaces and lays out the City’s
long-term vision and commitment to address our acute space challenges.”
However, Vancouver continues to lose arts and culture spaces, and arts and
culture organizations and artists continue to struggle to stay in Vancouver;
6. Within Making Space for Arts and Culture, goal three is focused on removing
regulatory barriers. It recommends that the city, “Explore ways to help artists,
nonprofits and event producers to navigate regulatory requirements in
partnership with the Commercial Renovation Center, including support for
independent professional advice such as building code consultants;”
7. Other cities, including Seattle and Austin, have connected dedicated
development and permitting staff directly to arts and culture projects in order to
help artists and arts organizations navigate restrictive regulations and processes;
and

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, May 29, 2024 11
8. Making Space for Arts and Culture also outlined the success of a Cultural Land
Trust model in other cities including Oakland, San Francisco, and London, to
support community-led projects to secure arts and cultural spaces in perpetuity.
221A, an artist-run centre and cultural space provider based in Chinatown, has
been working with local community partners to study and inform development of
a Vancouver-based Cultural Land Trust. More information is available at:
https://culturallandtrust.ca.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to report back by Q4 2024 with recommendations for
fulfilling the action items outlined in the September 2019 report Making Space for
Arts and Culture: Vancouver Cultural Infrastructure Plan, including:
a. Removing regulatory barriers and providing regulatory support for arts
and culture groups navigating permitting, renovations, and development
of their spaces.
b. Consideration of creating or re-focusing specific City of Vancouver staff
positions within Development, Buildings and Licensing, with the unique
knowledge and skills needed to support arts and culture groups in
navigating permitting, renovations and development.
c. Exploring community amenity or zoning reform tools in industrial and
commercial zoning areas that would result in additional creation or
retention of arts and culture spaces.
B. THAT Council direct staff to form an interdepartmental working group and report
back with recommendations for how the City of Vancouver can support the
development of an independent, not for profit Cultural Land Trust, taking into
consideration the learning from 221A and other community partners, to protect
and expand affordable arts and culture spaces in Vancouver in a financially and
operationally sustainable way over the long term.

organizations.

3. Piloting Pod Hotels in Vancouver
The Committee heard from one speaker who spoke in support of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
SECONDED by Councillor Dominato
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. Vancouver has a severe lack of hotel rooms as identified in the September 2023
motion Addressing the Hotel Supply Gap to Support the Tourism Economy and
Reduce Pressure on Local Housing;
2. Vancouver will be host to a number of upcoming large events including the
Invictus Games in 2025 and FIFA in 2026;
3. Council’s direction to prioritize new hotels has helped enable a number of hotels
proposals that are currently in various stages of the City’s zoning and approvals
processes, but they will require years to complete rezoning, development
approvals, building permit approvals, and construction;
4. Smaller room hotel accommodation (for example, “pod hotels”) can meet the
near-term (as well as longer-term) demand for affordable, high-quality, and well
managed overnight accommodation as part of Vancouver’s hotel room mix, and
reduce the immense pressure for short-term rentals on Vancouver’s limited rental
housing stock;
5. The recent construction and completion of ~3 million square feet of new office
space in the Metro Core during last five years, combined with changing
workplace attendance post-pandemic, has created significant office space
vacancy in the city particularly in older office buildings and commercial heritage
buildings; and
6. All other British Columbia municipalities administer the British Columbia Building
Code (BCBC), which permits the change-of-use from existing office to hotel use
with only project-based building structural upgrades for life safety and seismic
hazard due to similar level of risk, while the Vancouver Building By-Law (VBBL)
uniquely currently requires cost-prohibitive full-building upgrades for the same
change-of-use application.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council acknowledges the hotel shortage in Vancouver, and the potential
for Pod Hotels to help fill the gap, support innovation, and provide a more
affordable visitor accommodation option, leading up to and in time for FIFA 2026
and beyond.

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, May 29, 2024 15
B. THAT Council acknowledges there is opportunity to more fully explore
Vancouver’s specific developmental and building regulatory requirements as they
apply to Pod Hotels integration into existing commercial office building stock,
particularly with respect to the scope of structural upgrading, while duly
considering safety and accessibility, and directs staff to review existing
regulations and report back on the findings of the review as soon as possible;
FURTHER THAT Council direct staff to include in the report back, an assessment
of how enabling ongoing temporary use and occupancy as Pod Hotels in existing
commercial office space might afford the Chief Building Officer with greater
authority to facilitate the administration of such projects under the current set of
regulatory requirements (as well as the ability to require periodic review and
improvement), vs enabling permanent use or a permanent use pilot program
through changes that would align the Vancouver Building By-law with the BC
Building Code for required building upgrades for the adaptive re-use of existing
office space.
CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY (Vote No. 10009)
4. Allocating Additional Funds to Accelerate Pedestrian Safety Measures
The Committee heard from four speakers who spoke in support of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Dominato
SECONDED by Councillor Zhou
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. The City of Vancouver has a stated goal to have zero traffic related fatalities and
serious injuries – even one fatality is too many;
2. Although progress has been made toward zero traffic related fatalities and
serious injuries, more work needs to be done given the fact that fatalities and
serious injuries still occur;
3. In recent years, steps taken to improve transportation safety include – but are not
limited to – launching the school slow street initiative, the pilot program for two
new neighbourhood traffic management plans, and the recently adopted motion
to explore lowering residential street speed limits to 30km/hr;
4. In June 2022, Council directed staff “to explore opportunities to double the
funding allocation for the Transportation Safety Program as an amendment to the
2023-2026 Capital Plan: Final Plan, specifically for traffic signals, flashing
beacons, and zebra markings at crossings, as part of the Capital Plan Mid term
Update in 2024;
-

Minutes, Wednesday, May 29, 2024 16
5. The current 2023-2026 Capital Plan includes $13.4M allocated for installation of
16 signals and 100+ other safety improvements;
6. Flashing beacons and zebra crossings serve as vital tools that enhance driver
awareness of pedestrian rights of way, thereby fostering a safer environment for
both drivers and pedestrians by reducing the risk of collisions;
7. In addition to safety measures such as flashing beacons and zebra markings,
Leading Pedestrian Interval (LPIs) at major pedestrian crossings have proven to
be effective in Vancouver and elsewhere. According to City staff, these can
reduce vehicle-pedestrian crashes by an estimated 60%. The cost to install an
LPI is approximately $2,000;
8. There are currently 57 LPIs across the city and the City of Vancouver’s traffic
safety plans for 2024 include the installation of 15 new LPIs at a total cost of
$30K, mainly in the Downtown;
9. Given the relatively low cost to install LPIs, and the moderate safety impacts
identified in a study completed by UBC, the potential exists to double or even
triple the number of new LPIs in the 2023-2026 Capital Plan;
10. The toolkit of traffic calming measures, strategies, and safety improvements that
contribute to pedestrian safety also includes daylighting intersections to increase
visibility (particularly near schools, parks, and community centres), road
narrowing (ranging from flexiposts and striped paint that define spaces through to
more permanent concrete infrastructure), raised zebras crossings, curb bulges,
restricting right turns on red lights, accessible pedestrian signals, adjusted walk
times, as well as other mechanisms that provide visual cues and signals for
drivers to reduce speed at pedestrian-driver interface points;
11. The selection of LPI locations and locations for new and upgraded traffic signals,
flashing beacons, and zebra markings etc. depends on many factors such as
collision history, traffic volumes, pedestrian volumes, community amenities
nearby, and crosswalk visibility issues, among other factors; and
12. It is imperative that Council continue to prioritize pedestrian safety wherever and
whenever possible and ensure that an appropriate level of funds and operational
capacity are allocated toward traffic safety measures that have a high impact
such as LPIs and flashing pedestrian beacons.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to report back as part of the
Mid-term Capital Update in June 2024 with an operational plan to identify and then
allocate additional capital funds and capacity to accelerate the installation of pedestrian
safety measures across the city, particularly around schools, community centres, and
parks;
FURTHER THAT this operational plan and funding allocation include:
• a specific target to increase the number of pedestrian controlled traffic signals
and rapid flashing beacons as part of the 2023-2026 Capital Plan;

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, May 29, 2024 17
• a specific target to double or triple the number of leading pedestrian interval (LPI)
crossings in the city as part of the 2023-2026 Capital Plan, including exploration
of restricting right turns on red lights at LPI-enabled intersections; and
• an increase and prioritization of zebra markings and other safety improvements
such as those noted in clause 10 of the preamble above.
amended
AMENDMENT MOVED by Councillor Zhou
SECONDED by Councillor Dominato
THAT the following be added between the “THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT” and
the “FURTHER THAT”:
FURTHER THAT Council direct staff to seek opportunities to review the timing of
pedestrian walk signals at all intersections within 250 meters of schools to
accelerate the updating of these signals to comply with the Transportation
Association of Canada guidelines (1.0 m/s walking speed).
CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY (Vote No. 10010)
The amendment having carried, the motion as amended was put and CARRIED
UNANIMOUSLY (Vote No. 10011).
