2. Change to September Business Licence Hearing Panel - WITHDRAWN
This item was withdrawn as the Business Licence Hearing of September 28, 2021, had been
cancelled.
3. Acting on the Climate Emergency by Opposing the Tilbury LNG Phase Two
Expansion Project
MOVED by Councillor Boyle
SECONDED by Councillor Swanson
WHEREAS
1. The deadly impacts of climate change are already affecting Vancouverites
through extreme weather events, including heat waves and air quality advisories
due to wildfire smoke;
2. These and other impacts of climate change disproportionately affect vulnerable
and marginalized people in ways counter to the City of Vancouver’s equity goals;
3. Vancouver’s Climate Emergency Action Plan commits the city to reducing carbon
pollution 50% by 2030. Metro Vancouver’s Clean Air Plan proposes to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions in the region by 45% below 2010 levels;
4. The Tilbury LNG proposal in Delta and associated upstream fracking operations
would create 1.98 to 2.67 MT of carbon pollution per year, similar in scale to the
entire City of Vancouver’s 2.5 MT annual emissions. If approved, this single
facility will counteract all the work Vancouver is doing to address the climate
emergency;
5. FortisBC recently submitted a Detailed Project Description to the BC
Environmental Assessment Office and the Impact Assessment Agency, which
will now decide whether to request amendments to the Detailed Project
Description or make the decision to proceed to an environmental assessment,
exempt the project from an environmental assessment or terminate the
project. If the project proceeds, there would be at least three opportunities for
public comment and the process would not finish until late 2021 at the earliest;
6. Thirteen Indigenous Nations are participating in the environmental review
process and have shared concerns about Tilbury LNG’s impacts on their rights
and cumulative effects of development on their territories. These include the
Chawathil, Cheam, Cowichan, Halalt, Stz’uminus, Lyackson, Katzie, Kwantlen,
Musqueam, Tsawwasen, Tsleil-Waututh, Ts'uubaa-asatx Nations and the S’ólh
Téméxw Stewardship Alliance;
7. Richmond City Council and Port Moody City Council both voted to oppose Tilbury
LNG in 2020. Delta has provided some comments about fire safety and
continues to engage with the review but has not yet taken a position on the
proposal. Hundreds of residents in the area have also expressed concerns to

Council Meeting
Minutes, September 21, 2021 27
various levels of government;
8. Tilbury LNG does not align with regional air quality objectives and may release
contaminates like sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, carbon dioxide, particulate
matter and hydrocarbons into Metro Vancouver’s air shed. It also poses safety
risks from the transport and storage of a volatile material within a densely
populated area;
9. FortisBC has applied to the BC Utilities Commission with the intention of
recovering the costs of the Tilbury LNG expansion by raising prices for its gas
customers. If successful, ratepayers would be responsible for an estimated $778
million in higher utility bills;
10. The International Energy Agency says no new fossil fuel projects should be
approved if the world is to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 and therefore
maintain a safe climate;
11. In October 2020, Vancouver unanimously endorsed the Fossil Fuel Non-
Proliferation Treaty, which calls for an end to all new exploration and production
of coal, oil and gas.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED:
A. THAT Vancouver City Council declare its opposition to the Tilbury Phase Two
LNG Expansion Project.
B. THAT Council direct the Mayor to write a letter to the BC Environmental
Assessment Office communicating this opposition.
FURTHER THAT this letter be shared with other local governments in Metro
Vancouver.
C. THAT Council direct city staff to engage in the BC Environmental Assessment
process, if the project proceeds to a review. This intervention may include studies
on Tilbury LNG’s impacts to human health, marine ecosystems and the global
climate.

REFERRAL MOVED by Councillor Boyle
SECONDED by Councillor De Genova

In order to introduce and answer questions on Council Members’ Motion 4, Mayor Stewart
relinquished the Chair to Deputy Mayor Bligh until the completion of the item.
4. Establishing a Friendship City Program in the City of Vancouver
MOVED by Mayor Stewart
SECONDED by Councillor De Genova
WHEREAS
1. Partnering with cities located outside Canada is an effective way by which
Vancouver can build and strengthen cultural and business relationships around
the globe - especially in an increasingly divided world;
2. Vancouver has a long established “Sister City Program” and detailed and
extensive Sister City agreements with Edinburgh, Odessa, Guangzhou,
Yokohama and Los Angeles;
3. Vancouver is often approached to form official relationships with other cities but
has no formal mechanism to do so other than detailed, extensive, and sometimes
costly Sister City agreements;
4. The City of Toronto has a “Partnership City Program” similar in nature to
Vancouver’s “Sister City Program”, but also a less formal and more local
community-driven “Friendship City Program” which allows Toronto to expand its
range of city-to-city relationships without incurring significant additional
administrative costs;
5. Toronto’s Friendship City Program applications must be co-sponsored by a
Council member as well as an interested community organization, with the
candidate city also officially signalling a willingness to participate in a Friendship
City agreement.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to create a “Friendship City Program” including the
following provisions:
1. Applications to add a new Friendship City be initiated by a “sponsoring
community organization” that is also a registered non-profit society;
2. The sponsoring community organization represents a resident community
located in Vancouver with an active relationship with the proposed
Friendship City;
3. The sponsoring community organization be responsible for all associated
Friendship City activities and costs;
4. The sponsoring community organization demonstrates support and
commitment in terms of community interest and active participation in the
program;
5. The sponsoring community organization provides an annual written report
to Council with progress and activity updates;
6. Friendship City agreements expire at the end of five (5) years with an
option to renew;

Council Meeting
Minutes, September 21, 2021 29
7. Proposed Friendship Cities have aligned strategic values; shared
economic and cultural values with Vancouver, and have a similar size and
geography;
8. There is a limit of one Friendship City per country;
9. Every Friendship City agreement requires a separate Council motion;
10.Support provided by the City of Vancouver be limited to a letter signed by
Mayor, annual letters to confirm the agreement, and staff coordination of
annual reports to Council; and
11.Any other budgetary considerations are included in the foundational
motion to Council establishing the relationship with a new city.
B. THAT Council direct staff to include a framework for evaluating Friendship City
relationships, and a mechanism for terminating the Friendship City relationship, if
it no longer meets a standard such as community reporting, active relationship,
or shared values.
C. THAT Council direct staff to review the existing City of Vancouver Sister City
Program and provide a report back with recommendations to Council on the
program, including a review of the status of current Sister Cities, and suggestions
for updating the gendered language of the program.

5. Effective and Equitable Staffing for Council
MOVED by Councillor De Genova
SECONDED by Councillor Hardwick
WHEREAS
1. Current City of Vancouver policies permit the Mayor's staff to attend briefings
with or in place of the Mayor. The Mayor's staff also have the privilege of
communicating with city staff on behalf of the Mayor;
2. Staff contracted by Councillors who have signed a City of Vancouver Services
Agreement are not permitted to attend briefings or meetings with or on behalf of
Councillors;
3. Council supported a motion submitted by the Mayor in January 2019 titled
"Increasing Support for Councillors for Constituency Work". As a result of the
resolution, Councillors received an increase in their discretionary budget,
allocating a total of $30,000 per Councillor. Although this is significantly less than

Council Meeting
Minutes, September 21, 2021 30
the Mayor's discretionary budget, each Councillor can choose to spend this
budget to contract staff;
4. Legal agreements, including non-disclosure agreements, can be helpful tools to
protect information and uphold the requirements of confidentiality and the
Vancouver Charter;
5. Granting similar or equal access to the Mayor's Chiefs of Staff and staff
contracted to work for individual Councillors helps create a more equitable
workplace. Ultimately, this could help each Councillor better serve their
constituents.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to create or update City of Vancouver policies to allow
staff contracted by all council members, who have signed a City of Vancouver
services agreement, to have the same level of access, responsibilities and
privileges as the Mayor's Chiefs of Staff including but not limited to attending
briefings, meetings with staff and access to Council members offices.
B. THAT staff consider and execute any addendums and amendments to current
and future City of Vancouver service contracts to ensure compliance to the
Vancouver Charter and protect the integrity of information within the Vancouver
Charter.
C. THAT to provide fair and equal opportunities for all Council members, Council
direct staff to bring any necessary decisions of Council forward, in time to
implement these changes before November 2021.
