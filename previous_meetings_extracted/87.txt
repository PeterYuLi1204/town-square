ADOPTED ON CONSENT AND A AND B
BY THE REQUIRED MAJORITY (Vote No. 10726)
COUNCIL MEMBERS’ MOTIONS
1. Increasing Funding for Vital Community Libraries
The Committee heard from 15 speakers who spoke in support of the motion and one speaker
who provided general comments.
MOVED by Councillor Orr
SECONDED by Councillor Fry
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. Public libraries serve as vital community hubs that provide free and equitable
access to information, technology, and educational resources for people of all
ages and backgrounds;
2. Libraries provide essential services that support students, seniors, job seekers,
families, and underserved populations through programs and services that are
often unavailable elsewhere;
3. Increasing funding to Vancouver’s Libraries is a direct investment in education,
equity, and resilience in our communities that will benefit seniors, families, and
people across Vancouver;
4. The Council allocated budget for Vancouver libraries has resulted in a total of ten
branches being closed on Mondays and shortened hours at a number of
branches.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to work with Library staff and
the Vancouver Library Board to report back by Q3 with an estimate of cost to restore all
hours cut in April and opening all Vancouver libraries on Mondays;
FURTHER THAT Council direct staff to identify potential sources of municipal funding to
cover the costs of restoring cut library hours and opening all branches on Mondays.

THAT the motion be struck and replaced with the following:
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to work with Library
staff and the Vancouver Library Board to report back by Q3 with an estimate of
cost to open all Vancouver libraries on Mondays, based on the current collective
agreement provisions and service delivery standards;
FURTHER THAT Council direct staff to identify potential sources of municipal
funding and work with library staff to identify potential senior government funding
to cover the costs of opening all branches on Mondays, including a request that
library management continue to engage with CUPE Local 391 to address
operational issues associated with the scheduling provisions in the collective
agreement that affect the Library’s ability to maintain consistent service levels
across branches;
AND FURTHER THAT Council affirm additional funding was provided in the 2025
budget to support Monday openings at South Hill and Champlain branches, but
ongoing service challenges stem in part from staffing constraints and scheduling
limitations under the current collective agreement, and not from Council-directed
cuts, including:
 Limited flexibility to schedule full-time staff on Sundays,
 Increased costs to cover short-notice absences, and
 Reliance on part-time and auxiliary staff.

2. Reducing Home Demolition Waste in Vancouver
MOVED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
SECONDED by Councillor Dominato
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. Residential construction and demolition waste is a growing issue in Vancouver
and the region;

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, May 21, 2025 10
2. In response to the issue, Metro Vancouver through the initiative of its Zero Waste
Committee and staff have been engaging with companies working to provide
alternatives to demolition, and are supporting and partnering together with the
Government of Canada Research and Knowledge Initiative and the sector on a
Home Demolition Waste Prevention Forum that will take place in early June that
will bring together government and industry to discuss alternatives to
residential demolition;
3. Alternatives to residential demolition that adds to landfills include options such
as home relocation, home repurposing, and home deconstruction;
4. Regulations regarding home demolition fall within the jurisdiction of local
governments;
5. Currently in Vancouver, the Green Demolition By-law regulates the Re-use and
Recycling of Building Materials from Residential Buildings and stipulates that:
a. (3.1) No person may cause, permit or allow the demolition of a residential
building constructed in whole or in part before 1950 without a demolition
permit.
b. (3.2) Every demolition permit authorizing demolition of a residential
building constructed in whole or in part before 1950 must include a green
demolition condition, imposed by the Chief Building Official, requiring that
the building be subject to demolition resulting in the reuse or recycling of
not less than 75% of all building materials, by weight, excluding
hazardous materials.
c. (3.3) Every demolition permit authorizing demolition of a character
residential building constructed in whole or in part before 1950 must
include a green demolition condition, imposed by the Chief Building
Official, requiring that the character residential building be subject to
demolition resulting in the reuse or recycling of not less than 90% of all
building materials, by weight, excluding hazardous materials.
d. (3.4) In addition to the applicable green demolition condition imposed
under section 3.2 or 3.3 above, every demolition permit authorizing
demolition of a residential building constructed in whole or in part before
1910, or demolition of a heritage listed residential building constructed in
whole or in part before 1950, must include an additional green demolition
condition, imposed by the Chief Building Official, requiring that the
residential building be subject to demolition by means of deconstruction,
resulting in the salvage of at least three tonnes of wood.
There is no similar reuse or recycling requirement in Vancouver for post 1950
residential homes;
6. From 2016 to 2021 Metro Vancouver was the fastest growing metro area in
Canada welcoming 179,000 new residents -- a 7.3% population increase. This
growth which is expected to continue, Provincial Transit Oriented Development
regulations, and City of Vancouver planning initiatives supporting densification in
order to deliver needed new multi-family homes, puts pressure on our housing

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, May 21, 2025 11
supply and has the unintended consequence of generating huge amounts of
material and embodied carbon waste due to the demolition of oftentimes single
family homes;
7. Sadly, Metro Vancouver is one of the demolition capitals of the world on a per
capita basis. Currently more than 2,700 single family homes on average are
demolished across Metro Vancouver every year. The average 2,000 sq ft wood
framed building contains 65,000 KG of embodied carbon3 and 100,000 KG of
raw materials;
8. Thirty-three percent of our local landfills are full of construction and demolition
waste. There are responsible and sustainable alternatives to home demolition
including relocation and deconstruction. Reducing and recycling more home
waste would support sustainability, as well as enable the ability to extend landfill
life to support regional waste management needs for longer.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to report back in Fall 2025 on opportunities to
implement strategies to reduce home demolition waste in Vancouver through
educational initiatives such as but not limited to: the provision of information
materials, resources such as Building Removal Assessment checklists, and
information sessions for the development and construction sectors.
B. THAT following the implementation of any strategies to raise awareness of the
importance and benefits of reducing home demolition waste, Council direct staff
to report back on the response to such measures.
C. THAT recognizing Council’s priority direction to streamline development and
permitting approvals to expedite new housing and not to add to the time for
delivering new homes, that Council affirms that any future updates to the Green
Demolition By-law that regulates the Re-use and Recycling of Building Materials
from Residential Buildings to apply to homes built post 1950 be considered at a
future date should the educational measures not yield positive results, as well as
any additional initiatives to promote responsible alternatives to demolition such
as the requirement for a Responsible Building Removal Assessment, Early
Green Removal Permits, Refundable Demolition Deposits, Density Bonus for
Relocated or Fully Deconstructed Homes and a Streamlined Building Move-On
Permit Process.

3. Honouring Trey Helten: Renaming “Ashtrey Alley”
The Committee heard from eight speakers who spoke in support of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Orr
SECONDED by Councillor Klassen
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. The City of Vancouver has an east-west alleyway in the Downtown Eastside
located between Hastings and Pender, connecting Cambie and Abbott Street;
which was the site of Graffiti Art Wall Pilot3 between artist Trey Helten and
Vancouver Native Housing Society. The goals of the pilot4 stated that:
“Graffiti art walls support artistic expression, with a focus on supporting equity
denied communities. They provide a sanctioned location for street artists which
in-turn can foster a culture that discourages disrespectful or nuisance graffiti.
As dedicated spaces, they can also serve as a place for street artists to meet,
build community, and can provide opportunities for mentorship. Graffiti art walls
are considered temporary”.
2. Trey Helten was a beloved harm reduction advocate in the Downtown Eastside
who was known for his tireless work to help others, fight stigma against drug
users, and who saved hundreds of lives;
3. Trey Helten passed away in April of 2025;
4. The City of Vancouver has been a leader in harm reduction policies in Canada,
approving the “Four Pillars” approach to drug addiction starting in 2001, and
opening the first safe injection site in Canada in 2003;

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, May 21, 2025 13
5. Community members in the DTES are already informally calling the alley
between Hastings and Pender, connecting Cambie and Abbott Street “Ashtrey
Alley” in memory of Trey Helten.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to report back on the most
expeditious way to name the alley between Hastings and Pender, connecting Cambie
and Abbott Street, “Ashtrey Alley” in memory of Trey Helten and his contributions to the
community.
CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY (Vote No. 10722)
4. Places to Be and Places to Go
The Committee heard from three speakers who spoke in support of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Fry
SECONDED by Councillor Bligh
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. The City of Vancouver is committed to fostering an inclusive and supportive
environment for all residents and visitors;
2. Accessible drop-in spaces and public washrooms are essential for the dignity,
health, and well-being of both unhoused individuals and housed individuals;
3. The lack of accessible public washroom facilities can be uncomfortable for
visitors, in particular women and families with small children, but also tourists and
crowds for large public events from fireworks to FIFA;
4. The lack of accessible public washroom facilities disproportionately affects
vulnerable populations, including unhoused or underhoused people, elderly
people and people with disabilities. Most public washrooms are located in
Vancouver’s parks, and only available from dusk to dawn;
5. The lack of public washrooms impacts the city, health authority, and local
businesses. Open defecation brings significant engineering costs, water use,
disruption to small businesses, and major public health issues like dysentery or
Shigella. A disease of destitution, severe, multidrug-resistant (MDR) shigellosis
has been on the rise in Vancouver 5 “like wildfire among people who don't have

access to toilets, sinks, or showers”;
6. Business Improvement Areas in Vancouver are sounding the alarm as public
defecation in the city reaches new heights, the issue has “certainly gotten worse”
in recent years and has skyrocketed particularly in the previous two years6;
7. The Vancouver Charter (Part XV-Health s.330)7 empowers the local
government’s role regarding insanitation: (b) preventing, prohibiting, and
remedying insanitary conditions and places in the city; and (i) for acquiring real
property, and for constructing and maintaining thereon or thereunder lavatories,
urinals, water-closets, and the like conveniences, and for constructing and
maintaining such conveniences upon or under a street;
8. The lack of accessible drop-in and daytime shelter spaces disproportionately
affects vulnerable populations, including unhoused or underhoused people. In
many cases, street loitering and daytime encampments are a direct result of lack
of drop-in spaces, as most shelters are only open dusk to dawn. Anecdotally
many people congregate in alleys, on streets, and under awnings because they
have no where else to be, which presents a challenge to disincentivizing loitering,
camping, and certain forms of street disorder;
9. Demonstrably, according to the City’s recent Storefront Reports and Update on
Vacancy Analysis reporting, many of the areas with higher levels of loitering and
street disorder also have some of the highest rates of storefront vacancy;
10. The lack of accessible drop-in centres has direct cost impacts on City
engineering and police services and more indirectly on business viability, retail
districts, tourism and perceptions of public safety;
11. The City’s Vibrant Vancouver strategy calls for high-quality city services and
public infrastructure that make Vancouver a healthy, safe, beautiful and
enjoyable place for everyone, and strive to alleviate barriers to residents’ well-
being and sense of belonging.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to complete a needs assessment and identify locations
and funding necessary to support places to be and places to go, by Q3 2025

B. THAT Council call on the Province to complete a needs assessment for
Accessible Daytime Drop-in Shelter Spaces, in consultation with City staff, that
identifies locations and funding opportunities, with consideration for (but not
limited to) the following:
 Using underused buildings or spaces that could be adapted for daytime
drop-in use.
 Making sure drop-in spaces include basic needs like seating, phone
charging stations, access to washrooms, information, secure storage for
personal belongings, and services.
 Partnering with local organizations that can provide support services like
mental health care, job assistance, and other community supports.
 Locating drop-in spaces where they are most needed, areas with high
numbers of unhoused or underhoused people, near overnight shelters,
and where loitering or need is most visible.
FURTHER THAT staff report back with a progress update on the provincial needs
assessment by Q3 2025.
C. THAT Council request the Mayor write to the Provincial Government, including
the Ministers of Health, Social Development and Poverty Reduction,
Infrastructure, and Public Safety, as well as Vancouver Coastal Health, urging
immediate action and funding to support inclusive, accessible public spaces
across the city. This includes capital and operating support for essential “places
to go” and “places to be.”

The amended amendment having carried unanimously, the motion as amended was put and
CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY (Vote No. 10725).
FINAL MOTION AS APPROVED
WHEREAS
1. The City of Vancouver is committed to fostering an inclusive and supportive
environment for all residents and visitors;
2. Accessible drop-in spaces and public washrooms are essential for the dignity,
health, and well-being of both unhoused individuals and housed individuals;
3. The lack of accessible public washroom facilities can be uncomfortable for
visitors, in particular women and families with small children, but also tourists and
crowds for large public events from fireworks to FIFA;
4. The lack of accessible public washroom facilities disproportionately affects
vulnerable populations, including unhoused or underhoused people, elderly
people and people with disabilities. Most public washrooms are located in
Vancouver’s parks, and only available from dusk to dawn;
5. The lack of public washrooms impacts the city, health authority, and local
businesses. Open defecation brings significant engineering costs, water use,
disruption to small businesses, and major public health issues like dysentery or
Shigella. A disease of destitution, severe, multidrug-resistant (MDR) shigellosis
has been on the rise in Vancouver 8 “like wildfire among people who don't have
access to toilets, sinks, or showers”;
6. Business Improvement Areas in Vancouver are sounding the alarm as public
defecation in the city reaches new heights, the issue has “certainly gotten worse”
in recent years and has skyrocketed particularly in the previous two years9;
7. The Vancouver Charter (Part XV-Health s.330)10 empowers the local
government’s role regarding insanitation: (b) preventing, prohibiting, and
remedying insanitary conditions and places in the city; and (i) for acquiring real
property, and for constructing and maintaining thereon or thereunder lavatories,
urinals, water-closets, and the like conveniences, and for constructing and

maintaining such conveniences upon or under a street;
8. The lack of accessible drop-in and daytime shelter spaces disproportionately
affects vulnerable populations, including unhoused or underhoused people. In
many cases, street loitering and daytime encampments are a direct result of lack
of drop-in spaces, as most shelters are only open dusk to dawn. Anecdotally
many people congregate in alleys, on streets, and under awnings because they
have no where else to be, which presents a challenge to disincentivizing loitering,
camping, and certain forms of street disorder;
9. Demonstrably, according to the City’s recent Storefront Reports and Update on
Vacancy Analysis reporting, many of the areas with higher levels of loitering and
street disorder also have some of the highest rates of storefront vacancy;
10. The lack of accessible drop-in centres has direct cost impacts on City
engineering and police services and more indirectly on business viability, retail
districts, tourism and perceptions of public safety;
11. The City’s Vibrant Vancouver strategy calls for high-quality city services and
public infrastructure that make Vancouver a healthy, safe, beautiful and
enjoyable place for everyone, and strive to alleviate barriers to residents’ well-
being and sense of belonging.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to incorporate a needs assessment for Accessible
Universal Washrooms into the ongoing public washroom strategy report currently
in development. This assessment should identify potential locations and funding
sources and consider, but not be limited to, the following:
 Washrooms in high-traffic areas such as downtown, busy
neighbourhoods, and near transit hubs;
 Fully accessible facilities that meet the needs of people with disabilities;
 Safe, clean, and well-maintained washrooms, with clear systems in place
for upkeep.
FURTHER THAT staff be directed to include the results of this needs
assessment as part of the final public washroom report to be presented to
Council by Q4 2025.
B. THAT Council call on the Province to complete a needs assessment for
Accessible Daytime Drop-in Shelter Spaces, in consultation with City staff, that
identifies locations and funding opportunities, with consideration for (but not
limited to) the following:

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, May 21, 2025 19
 Using underused buildings or spaces that could be adapted for daytime
drop-in use.
 Making sure drop-in spaces include basic needs like seating, phone
charging stations, access to washrooms, information, secure storage for
personal belongings, and services.
 Partnering with local organizations that can provide support services like
mental health care, job assistance, and other community supports.
 Locating drop-in spaces where they are most needed, areas with high
numbers of unhoused or underhoused people, near overnight shelters,
and where loitering or need is most visible.
 Ensuring that a sufficient portion of funding secured for daytime drop-in
shelter spaces is allocated towards management of the public realm of
the building’s exterior, including but not limited to: cleaning of sidewalk
and laneway on a regular schedule; and ensuring structures are not
erected on the sidewalk outside drop-in shelter sites.
FURTHER THAT staff report back with a progress update on the provincial
needs assessment by Q3 2025.
C. THAT Council request the Mayor write to the Provincial Government, including
the Ministers of Health, Social Development and Poverty Reduction,
Infrastructure, and Public Safety, as well as Vancouver Coastal Health, urging
immediate action and funding to support inclusive, accessible public spaces
across the city. This includes capital and operating support for essential “places
to go” and “places to be.”
The Committee adjourned at 6:03 pm.
