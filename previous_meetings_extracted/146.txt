ENQUIRIES AND OTHER MATTERS
1. Demolition at 500 Dunsmuir Street
Councillor Bligh noted that on December 18, 2024, Vancouver City Council passed a motion to
approve the demolition of the building at 500 Dunsmuir Street due to the danger it posed. She
also noted that Council was not advised during the meeting of the financial impact and
inconvenience that it would have on local small businesses near the site as they were forced to
close for three days while the building was being demolished. She asked if the current owner of
the site could be advised of the financial loss of businesses over the three days of closures. She
asked the City Manager to continue the conversations with the small business owners until the
matter was resolved and to advise them that the City is aspiring to have the best communication
possible in situations like these to support the local small business sector. The City Manager
