the Standing Committee on City Finance and Services meeting on January 20, 2021.
Subsequently, due to time constraints, Council referred the following motion to the Standing
Committee on Policy and Strategic Priorities meeting on February 10, 2021, in order to hear
from speakers, debate and decision.
The Committee heard from one speaker in support of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Dominato
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. The 2SLGBTQ+ Advisory Committee is appointed by Vancouver City Council to
provide advice on enhancing access and inclusion for lesbian, gay, bisexual,
transgender, two-spirited, and queer communities so they may participate fully in
civic life;
2. Numerous local and international reports emphasize the importance of street and
sidewalk lighting for maintaining personal safety (real and perceived), reducing
pedestrian collisions, and promoting use of public spaces;
3. Poorly maintained and inadequate street lighting is especially problematic for
vulnerable groups such as 2SLGBTQ+ individuals, women, seniors, and persons
with disabilities;
4. The City of Vancouver website states that “keeping our streets, sidewalks, and
green spaces safe and clean for everyone to enjoy is a City priority”;
5. The City of Vancouver is seeking ‘Global Age-Friendly City’ status from the World
Health Organization, which requires cities to ensure an increased standard of
safety in all public spaces;
6. In October 2019, City Council passed a motion regarding the prioritization of
public realm maintenance;
7. In 2013, the Seniors Advisory Committee’ passed a motion calling for
improvements to identification and repair of non-functioning streetlights, as well
as the addition of lighting in poorly lit areas;
8. This motion was supported by the 2SLGBTQ+, Women’s, and Persons with
Disabilities Advisory Committees;
9. City Council, in response to this motion, called on staff to report on the current
level of service for non-functioning lights and any progress made on installing
additional lighting for pedestrian safety;
10. In response, staff committed to reducing repair time from an average of 21 days
to 7 days;

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, February 10 and 18, 2021 7
11. The 2SLGBTQ+ Advisory Committee’s examination of data reveals that lights are
repaired in accordance with this new standard, but only if/when they are brought
to the attention of City staff;
12. The City largely relies on citizens to identify non-functioning lights and report
them using 311 or VanConnect;
13. Members of our communities have observed that many lights are in disrepair for
several months, especially those near commercial areas, parks, or ‘dead zones’
(e.g., between buildings);
14. Our examination of 311 incident reports confirms that some lights are in disrepair
for long periods, but are repaired shortly after a first report is made;
15. Many people are unaware of the 311 and VanConnect systems, or experience
difficulty using them (e.g., requirement for too much information, disappearance
of service requests); and
16. Members of our communities remain concerned that there is insufficient or
obstructed lighting in several areas throughout the city, which affects their sense
of safety and curtails their nighttime activities.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to report on the feasibility of
the following:
1. An analysis of the effectiveness of relying on 311/VanConnect to report
lighting outages (e.g., percentage of citizens that know 311/VanConnect
can be used for reporting and, of those, percentage that are actually
willing to use it; the percentage of citizens who would need to be
knowledgeable about 311/VanConnect and willing to use it in order for
this tool to be sufficiently effective in identifying outages in a timely
manner);
2. A renewed public education campaign, based on the analysis above, to
encourage citizens to report lighting outages using 311 or VanConnect
(e.g., ads on social media, bus shelters, and TV/radio);
3. Encouraging 311 staff to streamline the reporting process as much as
possible (i.e., do not request too much information);
4. Encouraging city crews (e.g., sanitation workers) to report outages during
nightly shifts, especially in areas where citizens may be unlikely to report
(e.g., commercial areas, parks, and ‘dead zones’ between buildings);
5. Installing new lighting in poorly lit areas, especially sidewalk-level and
alleyway lighting in areas identified by residents as being at higher risk for
public safety concerns; and
6. Reducing the obstruction of lighting (e.g., from overhanging tree cover);

Minutes, February 10 and 18, 2021 8
FURTHER THAT Council direct staff to consult the relevant advisory committees on

Advisory Committee.

WHEREAS
1. Across Canada and the globe, government policies and financial pressures have
shifted housing away from a necessity and human right into an asset, commodity
and financial investment;
2. In Canada, this shift has included a transformation of smaller landlords to larger,
investment-oriented companies, including Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs);

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, February 10 and 18, 2021 15
3. REITs pool the capital of multiple investors to own, operate or finance income-
generating real estate. Investors can receive returns on their investments without
needing the expertise to buy or manage any properties themselves;
4. As of 2017, REITs owned 20% of units in Canada; in BC they own 4%;
5. REITs’ portion of the housing market locally and nationally continues to grow,
exposing more tenants to landlords who are motivated to displace existing
tenants in favour of wealthier ones who can generate the income expected for
their portfolio. This process feeds gentrification, poverty, and homelessness;
6. In 2019, the Government of Canada adopted the National Housing Strategy Act
(NHSA), which recognizes that housing is a fundamental human right;
7. Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) recently committed to
ensuring secure and affordable housing for all by 2030;
8. Cities like Vancouver continue to bear substantial responsibility for addressing
the housing crisis without sufficient resources from higher levels of government;
9. Cities like Vancouver must create innovative solutions to ensure that our
residents’ human rights are protected and to keep higher levels of government
accountable to their commitments;
10. Two REITs just bought 15 Vancouver apartment buildings with 614 units for
$292.5 million. Seven rental buildings in Vancouver’s West End are owned by a
single REIT company as of Summer 2020;
11. REITs’ offer investors the benefit of not having to pay federal business taxes as
long as the taxable income is distributed to unit holders;
12. The REIT business model often relies on substantially raising rents when tenants
leave or are evicted;
13. The BC Non-Profit Housing Association and the Co-op Housing Federation are
working with the BC government on an apartment acquisition strategy worth
$500 million and this is a significant step forward but won’t protect the majority of
older purpose-built rental buildings from falling prey to this business model;
14. The Canadian Alliance to End Homelessness warns “When investors buy up
rental housing, they deepen Canada’s housing crisis by taking existing rental
housing off the market or by increasing rent, making it unaffordable. This leaves
lower income Canadians facing eviction, unable to afford rent or to live in the
communities they choose. Following the pandemic there is an added risk that
such predatory purchases will accelerate as small asset owners are impacted by
rental loss and forced to sell their properties.”;
15. The Canadian Alliance to End Homelessness is calling for governments to
implement “measures to curtail the impacts of financialization of rental housing
markets by limiting the ability of large capital funds (including Real Estate Income
Trusts – REITS) to purchase ‘distressed’ rental housing assets.”; and

FINAL MOTION AS APPROVED
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. Across Canada and the globe, government policies and financial pressures have
shifted housing away from a necessity and human right into an asset, commodity
and financial investment;
2. In Canada, this shift has included a transformation of smaller landlords to larger,
investment-oriented companies, including Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs);
3. REITs pool the capital of multiple investors to own, operate or finance income-
generating real estate. Investors can receive returns on their investments without

Minutes, February 10 and 18, 2021 18
needing the expertise to buy or manage any properties themselves;
4. As of 2017, REITs owned 20% of units in Canada; in BC they own 4%;
5. REITs’ portion of the housing market locally and nationally continues to grow,
exposing more tenants to landlords who are motivated to displace existing
tenants in favour of wealthier ones who can generate the income expected for
their portfolio. This process feeds gentrification, poverty, and homelessness;

8. Daylighting Building Permit Wait Times (Member’s Motion B.4)
At the Council meeting on February 9, 2021, Council referred the following motion to the
Standing Committee on Policy and Strategic Priorities meeting on February 10, 2021, in order to
hear from speakers.
The Chair called for speakers and none were present.
MOVED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. The City of Vancouver continually works to make Vancouver's homes and
buildings safer, healthier, greener, and more accessible, including reviewing
permit applications and enforcing regulations in a fair and consistent manner,
and working to decrease the length and complexity of the permit process by
introducing – among other measures – online services and more efficient
procedures and processes;
2. Construction projects and any change of land use or occupancy on private
property require a building permit. All projects must comply with the Vancouver
Building By-law to meet life safety, livability, accessibility, and sustainability
requirements. Building permits are the tool the City uses to achieve these
requirements;
3. The City has a Small Business Commercial Renovation Centre (CRC) for small
business owners planning a renovation or looking to move or start a business in

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, February 10 and 18, 2021 20
Vancouver. The CRC offers assistance to help customers make an informed
decision about the suitability of a business property or the viability of a proposed
renovation;
4. Despite various strategies and measures implemented by the City of Vancouver
over time to improve permit wait times such as the Commercial Renovation
Centre launched in February 2017 (as a ‘one stop shop’ for small businesses to
get dedicated support), investments in technology to improve transparency,
workflow, and overall customer experience, increased staff to address backlogs
and specific areas of need, as well as conducting stakeholder engagements,
policy inventories, high-level process and decision-making reviews, and data and
metrics reviews, the duration and clarity surrounding permit wait times continue
to be an impediment to those wishing to invest in existing and/or open new
businesses in Vancouver;
5. At a public hearing on June 25, 2020, Council approved amendments to
clean-up, clarify, and consolidate our land use regulations and related land use
documents to make them more user-friendly. These amendments represent
incremental changes toward a set of simplified zoning regulations and are
intended to help simplify and streamline permit reviews in combination with
permit processing improvements;
6. Likewise, on July 24, 2020, Council enacted the amendments to the zoning
regulations noted above, and on September 15, 2020, Council gave final
approval to the various consequential amendments related to the City’s land use
documents. The updated and simplified land use regulations and policies are
intended to result in review processes that are more streamlined;
7. With reference to the City’s “Regulation Redesign” initiative – a comprehensive
ongoing review of the City’s land use regulations and related policy documents –
staff are scheduled to report back to Council in the Winter of 2021 with regulatory
updates related to the drafting and refining of new zoning by-laws, the
development of an implementation plan for introducing new by-laws, and the
communication protocols and procedures for developing regulations and policies,
along with related public engagement opportunities. The timeline for
implementation of the above-noted report items is scheduled for 2022;
8. Despite the foregoing, and despite the various strategies and measures
implemented by the City to improve permit wait times, a lack of clear information
and general uncertainty regarding permit wait times continues to be an issue,
especially in terms of transparently communicating wait times to the general
public and small businesses wishing to expand or open. For example, the CRC
webpage on the City’s website shows “permit processing times as of
January 1, 2021” but only for one permit category – namely, for “Minor
commercial renovation” work;
9. Likewise, the CRC webpage notes a target to issue 95% of “minor commercial
renovation” permits within seven weeks, yet only 44% of these applications have
been accomplished within the seven-week target in the last three months; further
there is no clear information given regarding the average wait time;
10. The impact of delays and/or permit processing times that are longer than
expected causes a range of financial hardships for small businesses, not the

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, February 10 and 18, 2021 21
least of which are having to carry extra months of lease costs without any
revenue, delaying the projected timeline for opening to the paying public, and
generally impacting the financial well-being and sustainability of a business
(especially considering the added layers of uncertainty due to COVID-19); and
11. Making clear, transparent information available to small businesses would help
them to plan more effectively, for example in negotiating leases by knowing the
length of time they will have to plan for carrying costs along with other matters
relevant to opening or expanding a small business (while recognizing that wait
times could be subject to change for a number of reasons such as the
completeness of a permit application, questions that arise, and the volume of
instream applications to be processed).
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Vancouver City Council direct staff to post easy-
to-access information on the City’s website that would show current projected wait times
for various building permit types in as close to real-time as possible, so that businesses
planning to make improvements and/or changes to their premises (where a permit is
required), or people planning to open a new business that would require permits, can
have greater clarity and ability to plan appropriately and achieve success.
CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY (Vote No. 06962)
9. UBCM Resolution: Updating BC’s Wrongful Death Law (Member’s Motion B.5)
At the Council meeting on February 9, 2021, Council referred the following motion to the
Standing Committee on Policy and Strategic Priorities meeting on February 10, 2021, in order to
hear from speakers.
The Committee heard from five speakers in support of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Fry
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. Natasha Forry was a healthy, vibrant, Vancouver born and raised 29-year-old.
On October 12th, 2020, Ms. Forry died of a treatable staph infection despite four
visits over ten days and multiple misdiagnoses at her local hospital.1 Because
Ms. Forry leaves behind no financial dependents, her family is denied an
opportunity of legal remedy or accountability for her wrongful death;
2. Tragically, hundreds of British Columbians will experience the loss of a loved one
each year, and in the event of a wrongful death many will discover they cannot
access legal representation or recourse;
3. Wrongful deaths and harms are disproportionately experienced by Indigenous
and racialized people. The National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered
Indigenous Women and Girls and In Plain Sight: Addressing Indigenous-specific
Racism and Discrimination in B.C. Health Care 2 recognize systemic inequities for
Indigenous peoples in the care system, and variously recommend fully
investigating deaths of Indigenous youth in care; and an obligation to support

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, February 10 and 18, 2021 22
families, recognizing cultural and spiritual losses, and access to justice;
4. Wrongful Death Law in BC is legislated by the Family Compensation Act, with
accompanying provisions in the Wills, Estates and Succession Act, for
determining the “worth” of a deceased family member. Currently, access to the
courts requires that the deceased was a breadwinner, meaning that typically the
wrongful death of a child, an elderly person, or someone with a significant
disability cannot go to trial, and precludes opportunities for independent
investigation, recourse, or accountability that could avail justice, system change,
economic or non-economic damages;
5. The Family Compensation Act is antiquated legislation that’s had no significant or
meaningful updates since its adoption from the UK’s “Lord Campbell’s Act” in
1846, and British Columbia is the last remaining province in Canada yet to
modernize its wrongful death legislation to provide a modern standard of human
value, dignity, and protection under the law. 3 BC’s Family Compensation Act
discriminates against children, the elderly and many people with disabilities when
killed by the recklessness and harm of another;
6. The Canadian Bar Association of BC has recommended the Family
Compensation Act be amended to provide for bereavement damages in the
event of a death of a family member caused by the wrongdoing of another
person or entity, with the reasoning: “The current failure of the law to recognize
such losses is offensive and inexplicable to BC families who experience such
tragedies, fails to reflect modern-day accepted norms as to basic fairness in a
tort system, and is out of line with the law in most jurisdictions in Canada”; 4 and
7. The BC Wrongful Death Law Reform Society has recommended the replacement
of the Family Compensation Act, to allow for non-pecuniary damages relating to
the loss of love, guidance, care, companionship, and affection, as well as
conscious pain and suffering that the decedent endured before death, and in
egregious circumstances, punitive damages. 5
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT the following resolution be submitted to LMLGA for submission as a 2021
UBCM Resolution, and titled: “Updating BC’s Wrongful Death Law”:
WHEREAS Tragically, hundreds of British Columbians will experience the
loss of a loved one each year, and in the event of a wrongful death, many
will discover they cannot access legal representation or recourse because
Wrongful Death Law in BC is legislated by the Family Compensation Act
and provisions in the Wills, Estates and Succession Act in determining
the “worth” of a deceased family member. Currently, access to the courts
requires that the deceased was a breadwinner, and otherwise precludes
opportunities for independent investigation, recourse, or accountability
that could avail justice, system change, economic or non-economic
damages.
AND WHEREAS the Family Compensation Act is antiquated legislation
that’s had no significant or meaningful updates since the 1800s, and
British Columbia is the last remaining province in Canada to modernize its
wrongful death legislation to provide a fair standard of human value,

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, February 10 and 18, 2021 23
dignity, and protection under the law. BC’s Family Compensation Act
discriminates against children, the elderly and many people with
disabilities when killed by the recklessness and harm of another.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT the UBCM request the
Government of British Columbia and Attorney General modernize and
reform wrongful death law in British Columbia to ensure access to justice,
accountability, and compensation in British Columbia for the surviving
family members of those wrongfully killed.

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, February 10 and 18, 2021 24
MOVED by Councillor Fry
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. The Vancouver Act of Incorporation of April 6, 1886, was enacted by the
Government of the Province of British Columbia, and established the City of
Vancouver and its City Council as an order of local government with a
requirement for democratic elections. The first Vancouver municipal election took
place in May 1886, and since that time through the Vancouver Incorporation Act
of 1921, to amalgamation in 1929, to the Vancouver Charter of 1953, the rules
and governance of Vancouver municipal elections have evolved to respond to
legal and societal changes through many amendments over many years;
2. The B.C. government is responsible for the core local government system and its
legislative framework including maintaining and changing the framework for local
elections, by-elections and assent voting events. Elections in Vancouver are
variously governed by provincial legislation including the BC Election Act 1, the
BC Local Elections Campaign Financing Act 2 and The Vancouver Charter 3, as
well as the City’s Election By-law 9070 4 and Code of Conduct Corporate Policy 5
(currently under consideration for adoption as by-law);
3. The administration of local elections and by-elections is a shared responsibility
between the government of the City of Vancouver and Elections BC. Elections
BC is responsible for the administration of the provincial electoral process in B.C.
and the campaign financing and third party advertising rules under the Local
Elections Campaign Financing Act;
4. Across Canada, municipalities continue to struggle with low voter turnout
(average 40%), lack of diversity represented in election results 6,
disenfranchisement of youth and permanent residents, impacts of emergent
digital campaign tools, political machines, and civic literacy. Vancouver has
additionally struggled with “big money” under-regulated financial influence in
elections;
5. Recent efforts to remedy and reform the electoral process include advocacy and
resolutions from current and past Vancouver Councils, and through the Union of
BC Municipalities (UBCM). These efforts have resulted in:
a. Amendments to the Local Election Campaign Finance Act (LECFA) in
2018 which resulted in a number of significant campaign finance reforms
notably stricter limits, and the elimination of corporate and union
donations;
b. The creation of Vancouver’s Independent Election Task Force, which
analyzed voting and electoral systems in Vancouver and reported in 2017
and 2019 with a number of priority recommendations and reforms, few of
which have been implemented; and
c. Vancouver’s Report Back on the Random Order Ballot Model Used in the
2018 Vancouver Election, suggesting improvements to the random ballot
process and measures to more carefully manage and limit the number of
names on ballots, considered by City Council in January of 2021;

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, February 10 and 18, 2021 25
6. Several of the remedies and reforms suggested by the IETF reports cannot be
implemented by the City of Vancouver and await a response from the province.
Some under consideration include:
a. UBCM 2020 Special Resolution 3 (SR3) Local Government Election
Financing is currently under review with the province and incorporates a
number of Vancouver-led 2020 election finance reform resolutions
(notably C5 and C6) calling upon the province to amend the LEFCA to:
i. require all elector organizations, as defined under the Local
Government Act to register with Elections BC, similar to how
provincial political parties are registered with Elections BC;
ii. require real time disclosure of in-kind support and financial
contributions made to local government election candidates in
election years, as well as to sitting elected officials in non-election
years;
iii. apply contributor and contribution limits to operating accounts of
elector organizations and candidates for operational purposes at
all times, and to require that annual disclosure reports of
contributions received in operating bank accounts, in election
years and non-election years; and
iv. establish a pre-campaign period during which time all election
advertising must include sponsorship information;
b. UBCM 2019 B108 Youth Voting in Local Government Elections,
resolution to lower the voting age to 16 (still under provincial review);
c. UBCM 2019 B109 Fresh Voices #LostVotes, to allow Permanent
Residents to vote (still under provincial review, and considering federal
consultation);
d. Additional recommendations by the IETF that have not been formally
submitted for consideration include:
i. Use of “Own Funds”;
ii. Distinction between (types of) third parties;
iii. Exemptions for Small Entities;
iv. Counting Contributions of Staff Time; and
v. Different Treatment of Independent and Party-Affiliated
Candidates;
7. Priority recommendations from The City of Vancouver Independent Election Task
Force 2017 7 include several suggested reforms that do not require provincial
legislation, and could be implemented by the City of Vancouver, notably:

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, February 10 and 18, 2021 26
a. Using a deliberative participatory process to determine a system of
Proportional Representation suited for municipal elections in Vancouver;
b. Amend the City of Vancouver Code of Conduct for Council officials
requiring elected officials to withdraw from the decision-making process in
matters submitted to City Council from corporations, unions, non-profit
societies, and associations that contribute directly or indirectly to their
campaigns. Require all submissions before Vancouver City Council to
indicate whether the applicants (either the applying entity, or in the case
of an organization, its officers) made campaign contributions and, if so, to
whom. Contributors would self-identify on submissions that require a
decision by City Council. The disclosure would accompany the
submissions throughout the decision-making process.; and
c. Increase voter turnout through positive cues to improve engagement,
civic literacy, and political knowledge;
8. Priority recommendations from The City of Vancouver Independent Election Task
Force 2019 8 include several suggested reforms that do not require provincial
legislation, and could be implemented by the City of Vancouver, notably:
a. Increase penalties and associated enforcement mechanisms to a level
where this is a reliable disincentive to contravene regulations. Penalties
need not be solely monetary and could include the loss of right to enter
into a municipal contract (Recommendation 12);
b. Invest in voter engagement (Recommendation 13); and
c. The need for more research and a new Independent Election Task Force
(Recommendations 14 and 15);
9. The City of Vancouver Independent Election Task Force 2019 additionally
recommends “Expanding the Definition of Advertising” (Recommendation 6) to
include paid phone banking, paid digital campaigns, polling, and paid door-to-
door canvassing:
a. Today, sophisticated data analytics, weapons-grade communication
technology 9, artificial intelligence and machine learning, alongside under-
regulated online campaign and engagement tools have created a fertile
environment for a new political machine for the 21st Century.
b. These concepts may not have been contemplated in reforms to the
LECFA in 2018, or submitted for provincial consideration but are viewed
by data and privacy experts as an emergent threat to democratic process
10;
c. Recent investigations and revelations around Cambridge Analytica and
the use of psychographic profiling and predicting techniques to identify
voter behaviour and persuade the persuadables have been implicated in
manipulating electoral outcomes in developing nations and more recently
Trump in the United States and Brexit in the UK; 11 and

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, February 10 and 18, 2021 27
d. A joint investigation by BC and Canadian privacy commissioners12 has
revealed one local company, Aggregate IQ Data Services (AIQ) was
responsible for privacy violations and data breaches and provided
services to “several political organizations and campaigns in BC,”
including “provincial party, certain candidates in the 2017 provincial
election, a candidate for the leadership of a provincial party, and a
municipal slate in the 2018 local elections”; 13
10. The COVID-19 pandemic and resulting socio-economic crisis have strained the
City of Vancouver’s financial and human resources, as well as means to
effectively engage with Vancouver voters and non-voters alike; and
11. Current City-led public outreach opportunities to improve civic literacy include the
Vancouver Plan, led by PDS and operating across departments; and the “Your
City Hall” (YCH) initiative, led by the City Clerk’s Office. The YCH initiative
intends to take new actions aimed at reducing systemic barriers through civic
engagement and outreach, to increase voter turnout and candidate diversity.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to include as part of Your City Hall and/or another City-
led undertaking, a deliberative public participatory process, to engage, consider
and report back on Vancouverites preference for a system of Proportional
Representation suited for municipal elections;
FURTHER THAT Council direct staff to report back on methodology and cost to
establish a Citizen’s Assembly to review and recommend a preferred electoral
system for Vancouver, independently or in collaboration with the above
deliberative public participatory process findings;
AND FURTHER THAT timing of this work consider an opportunity for voters in

substitute for – reports undertaken by the city election office.
E. THAT Council direct staff to include opportunities and engagement to improve
civic literacy and voter turnout as part of the Your City Hall initiative, as well as
through information and dialogues conveyed through the Vancouver Plan.
F. THAT the following resolution be submitted to LMLGA for submission as a 2021
UBCM Resolution titled “Expanding definitions and responsibilities of digital
campaigns”:
WHEREAS Elections BC regulates and defines online advertising as
election advertising that has or would normally have a placement cost,
but this does not specifically or explicitly include all digital campaigns or
data collection.
AND WHEREAS Sophisticated data analytics, weapons-grade
communication technology, artificial intelligence and machine learning,
alongside under-regulated online campaign and engagement tools have
emerged to use psychographic profiling and predicting techniques to
identify voter behaviour and persuade the persuadables using a variety of
online engagement methods including but not limited to news, profiles,
groups, memes and shareables. The use of deceptive and coercive digital
campaigns have been implicated in manipulating electoral outcomes in
developing nations, and more recently the Trump campaign in the United
States, Brexit in the UK (Cambridge Analytica) and in BC’s 2017
provincial and 2018 local elections (AIQ).
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT the UBCM request the
Government of British Columbia to expand the definition of advertising to
cover digital political campaigns and tools, and mandate their disclosure
of how and when data is being collected and used, and by whom.
FURTHER THAT Whereas clause number 9 and related footnotes be
included as backgrounder to this motion.
FURTHER THAT the Mayor on behalf of council write to the Premier and
Minister of Municipal Affairs requesting the Government of British
Columbia consider and implement this request as an amendment to the
Local Election Campaign Finance Act.
AND FURTHER THAT Council direct staff to consider and report back on
implementing these recommendations into the Council Code of Conduct
and/or Election By-law No. 9070.

FINAL MOTION AS APPROVED
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. The Vancouver Act of Incorporation of April 6, 1886, was enacted by the
Government of the Province of British Columbia, and established the City of
Vancouver and its City Council as an order of local government with a
requirement for democratic elections. The first Vancouver municipal election took
place in May 1886, and since that time through the Vancouver Incorporation Act
of 1921, to amalgamation in 1929, to the Vancouver Charter of 1953, the rules
and governance of Vancouver municipal elections have evolved to respond to
legal and societal changes through many amendments over many years;
2. The B.C. government is responsible for the core local government system and its
legislative framework including maintaining and changing the framework for local
elections, by-elections and assent voting events. Elections in Vancouver are
variously governed by provincial legislation including the BC Election Act 1, the
BC Local Elections Campaign Financing Act 2 and The Vancouver Charter 3, as
well as the City’s Election By-law 9070 4 and Code of Conduct Corporate Policy 5
(currently under consideration for adoption as by-law);
3. The administration of local elections and by-elections is a shared responsibility
between the government of the City of Vancouver and Elections BC. Elections
BC is responsible for the administration of the provincial electoral process in B.C.
and the campaign financing and third party advertising rules under the Local
Elections Campaign Financing Act;
4. Across Canada, municipalities continue to struggle with low voter turnout
(average 40%), lack of diversity represented in election results 6,
disenfranchisement of youth and permanent residents, impacts of emergent
digital campaign tools, political machines, and civic literacy. Vancouver has
additionally struggled with “big money” under-regulated financial influence in
elections;
5. Recent efforts to remedy and reform the electoral process include advocacy and
resolutions from current and past Vancouver Councils, and through the Union of
BC Municipalities (UBCM). These efforts have resulted in:
a. Amendments to the Local Election Campaign Finance Act (LECFA) in
2018 which resulted in a number of significant campaign finance reforms

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, February 10 and 18, 2021 36
notably stricter limits, and the elimination of corporate and union
donations;
b. The creation of Vancouver’s Independent Election Task Force, which
analyzed voting and electoral systems in Vancouver and reported in 2017
and 2019 with a number of priority recommendations and reforms, few of
which have been implemented; and
c. Vancouver’s Report Back on the Random Order Ballot Model Used in the
2018 Vancouver Election, suggesting improvements to the random ballot
process and measures to more carefully manage and limit the number of
names on ballots, considered by City Council in January of 2021;
6. Several of the remedies and reforms suggested by the IETF reports cannot be
implemented by the City of Vancouver and await a response from the province.
Some under consideration include:
a. UBCM 2020 Special Resolution 3 (SR3) Local Government Election
Financing is currently under review with the province and incorporates a
number of Vancouver-led 2020 election finance reform resolutions
(notably C5 and C6) calling upon the province to amend the LEFCA to:
i. require all elector organizations, as defined under the Local
Government Act to register with Elections BC, similar to how
provincial political parties are registered with Elections BC;
ii. require real time disclosure of in-kind support and financial
contributions made to local government election candidates in
election years, as well as to sitting elected officials in non-election
years;
iii. apply contributor and contribution limits to operating accounts of
elector organizations and candidates for operational purposes at
all times, and to require that annual disclosure reports of
contributions received in operating bank accounts, in election
years and non-election years; and
iv. establish a pre-campaign period during which time all election
advertising must include sponsorship information;
b. UBCM 2019 B108 Youth Voting in Local Government Elections,
resolution to lower the voting age to 16 (still under provincial review);
c. UBCM 2019 B109 Fresh Voices #LostVotes, to allow Permanent
Residents to vote (still under provincial review, and considering federal
consultation);
d. Additional recommendations by the IETF that have not been formally
submitted for consideration include:
i. Use of “Own Funds”;
ii. Distinction between (types of) third parties;

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, February 10 and 18, 2021 37
iii. Exemptions for Small Entities;
iv. Counting Contributions of Staff Time; and
v. Different Treatment of Independent and Party-Affiliated
Candidates;
7. Priority recommendations from The City of Vancouver Independent Election Task
Force 2017 7 include several suggested reforms that do not require provincial
legislation, and could be implemented by the City of Vancouver, notably:
a. Using a deliberative participatory process to determine a system of
Proportional Representation suited for municipal elections in Vancouver;
b. Amend the City of Vancouver Code of Conduct for Council officials
requiring elected officials to withdraw from the decision-making process in
matters submitted to City Council from corporations, unions, non-profit
societies, and associations that contribute directly or indirectly to their
campaigns. Require all submissions before Vancouver City Council to
indicate whether the applicants (either the applying entity, or in the case
of an organization, its officers) made campaign contributions and, if so, to
whom. Contributors would self-identify on submissions that require a
decision by City Council. The disclosure would accompany the
submissions throughout the decision-making process.; and
c. Increase voter turnout through positive cues to improve engagement,
civic literacy, and political knowledge;
8. Priority recommendations from The City of Vancouver Independent Election Task
Force 2019 8 include several suggested reforms that do not require provincial
legislation, and could be implemented by the City of Vancouver, notably:
a. Increase penalties and associated enforcement mechanisms to a level
where this is a reliable disincentive to contravene regulations. Penalties
need not be solely monetary and could include the loss of right to enter
into a municipal contract (Recommendation 12);
b. Invest in voter engagement (Recommendation 13); and
c. The need for more research and a new Independent Election Task Force
(Recommendations 14 and 15);
9. The City of Vancouver Independent Election Task Force 2019 additionally
recommends “Expanding the Definition of Advertising” (Recommendation 6) to
include paid phone banking, paid digital campaigns, polling, and paid door-to-
door canvassing:
a. Today, sophisticated data analytics, weapons-grade communication
technology 9, artificial intelligence and machine learning, alongside under-
regulated online campaign and engagement tools have created a fertile
environment for a new political machine for the 21st Century.

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, February 10 and 18, 2021 38
b. These concepts may not have been contemplated in reforms to the
LECFA in 2018, or submitted for provincial consideration but are viewed
by data and privacy experts as an emergent threat to democratic process
10;
c. Recent investigations and revelations around Cambridge Analytica and
the use of psychographic profiling and predicting techniques to identify
voter behaviour and persuade the persuadables have been implicated in
manipulating electoral outcomes in developing nations and more recently
Trump in the United States and Brexit in the UK; 11 and
d. A joint investigation by BC and Canadian privacy commissioners12 has
revealed one local company, Aggregate IQ Data Services (AIQ) was
responsible for privacy violations and data breaches and provided
services to “several political organizations and campaigns in BC,”
including “provincial party, certain candidates in the 2017 provincial
election, a candidate for the leadership of a provincial party, and a
municipal slate in the 2018 local elections”; 13
10. The COVID-19 pandemic and resulting socio-economic crisis have strained the
City of Vancouver’s financial and human resources, as well as means to
effectively engage with Vancouver voters and non-voters alike; and
11. Current City-led public outreach opportunities to improve civic literacy include the
Vancouver Plan, led by PDS and operating across departments; and the “Your
City Hall” (YCH) initiative, led by the City Clerk’s Office. The YCH initiative
intends to take new actions aimed at reducing systemic barriers through civic
engagement and outreach, to increase voter turnout and candidate diversity.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to include as part of Your City Hall and/or another City-
led undertaking, a deliberative public participatory process, to engage, consider
and report back on Vancouverites preference for a system of Proportional
Representation suited for municipal elections;
FURTHER THAT Council direct staff to report back on methodology and cost to

E. THAT Council direct staff to include opportunities and engagement to improve
civic literacy and voter turnout as part of the Your City Hall initiative, as well as

MOVED by Councillor Bligh
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. The Cannabis Act (S.C. 2018, c. 16) legalized the use of cannabis for
recreational purposes, and regulated its production, distribution, sale and use
federally across Canada;1
2. The Province of British Columbia Liquor and Cannabis Regulation Branch
(LCRB) is responsible for the oversight, regulation, and enforcement of private,
non-medical cannabis retail within the province;2
3. The Provincial Community Safety Unit (CSU) is responsible for compliance and
enforcement with respect to sales by unlicensed retailers under the Cannabis
Control and Licensing Act;3
4. The Province of British Columbia requires all cannabis retailers to have a
provincial retail store license that is awarded upon municipal recommendation,
and involves a $7500 application fee, a $1500 first-year license fee, a $1500
annual renewal fee, and a security screening renewal fee. This fee is
non-refundable;4
5. The City of Vancouver requires all cannabis retailers to have a municipal
development permit costing at least $908 for 100 square-metres of floor space,
that increases with the size of the development;5
6. The City of Vancouver requires all cannabis retailers to have a municipal

business license, which has a fee of $33,958 in 2020;6
7. The license fee of $30,000 for medical marijuana retailers was initially
implemented by a 2015 bylaw amendment with the purpose of recuperating the
costs of enforcement by the City on non-licensed marijuana retailers;7
8. The Worker Qualification Regulation of the provincial Cannabis Control and
Licensing Act (CCLA) and Cannabis Distribution Act (CDA) requires all
employees of cannabis retailers to have had a security verification check once
every five years;8
9. Comparable annual business license fees in the City of Vancouver for 2020 are
substantially lower than the annual fee for cannabis retail: the liquor retail store
fee is $429.00; the maximum fee for a standard hours liquor establishment is
$3,219.00; the next highest retail dealer fee is $4,595.00 for a 50,000 sq ft
premises; a Class-2 Casino license fee and the license fee for a Horse Racing
Exhibition are both $13,464.00; the Pacific National Exhibition annual license fee
is $18,856.00; and the maximum fee for an extended hours liquor establishment
is $23,525.00;9
10. The municipal business license fee for cannabis in comparable cities within the
province are significantly less than Vancouver; Victoria requires a $5000
business license fee and a $7500 rezoning fee, while Kelowna requires a $1,000
non-refundable application fee, a $9,495 rezoning fee and an annual $9,645
business licensing fee;10
11. Municipalities across the country are often exempted from municipal license fees
where cost-sharing agreements are in place as the provincial government bears
the burden of the cost of enforcement, such as cities like Toronto and Halifax;11
12. Staff have stated that the fee acts as a cost recuperation measure going towards
four areas: policy and regulation development, customer and operations support,
retail license and review legislation, and compliance/enforcement; with the main
staff cost associated with reviewing applications, while compliance/enforcement
makes up the majority of costs to the City, despite being under the jurisdiction of
the province;12
13. The extremely high size of the municipal business license fee for cannabis
retailers acts as a significant barrier to entry for businesses seeking to join the
legal market, which can incentivize them into operating illicitly, requiring
additional enforcement and compliance costs, increasing the risk to public safety,
and undermining the operations of the legal businesses who have paid the
exorbitant licensing fee; and

13. Childcare that Works: Extended Hour and Around-the-Clock Childcare for Working
Families in Vancouver (Member’s Motion B.9)
At the Council meeting on February 9, 2021, Council referred the following motion to the
Standing Committee on Policy and Strategic Priorities meeting on February 10, 2021, in order to
hear from speakers.
The Committee heard from six speakers in support of the motion, one speaker in opposition and
one speaker who spoke to other matters in relation to the motion.
MOVED by Councillor De Genova
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. The current City Council has identified Childcare as a top priority;
2. Increasing safe and affordable childcare spaces in all Vancouver
neighbourhoods is essential for families with young children;
3. In December 2018 Council unanimously supported the motion “Building a Family
Friendly Vancouver: Affordable Child Care”. Staff are currently working on the
direction from this motion and will report back to Council with recommendations
hopefully in 2021;

Minutes, February 10 and 18, 2021 52
4. The availability of quality childcare is essential to Vancouver’s work force and
affects Vancouver’s economy;
5. Canadian cities located in Ontario and Quebec do have licensed childcare
centres providing 24-hour childcare models. Both provincial governments have
provided subsidies. The high demand for extended hour childcare is supported
by significant waitlist. For example, a 24-hour licensed childcare centre located in
Barrie, Ontario opened with 70 licensed spots in 2015 and has a steady waitlist
of approximately 800 children;
6. Many families with young children, including single-parent families, work on
various shift patterns, including overnight and on weekend shifts;
7. Many families requiring childcare due to work outside of traditional hours are also
low income and single parent families. These families often must make
arrangements for childcare that are not ideal, stable and/or come at a greater
cost than families who are supported;
8. The expense of childcare is greater than the expense of housing for many
families with young children living in the City of Vancouver;
9. Although zoning does not exclude licensed childcare centres that wish to operate
24 hours, the current requirements for childcare at the City of Vancouver does
not include guidelines that address space necessary for extended hour or 24
hour childcare models, including overnight sleeping areas; and
10. The Provincial government has committed funding from the Childcare BC’s New
Spaces Fund for the Tamitik Status of Women (TSW) in Kitimat, a 24-hour
childcare facility that is expected to open in 2022. The licensed facility will offer
60 new spaces and provide childcare for infants and toddlers and school-age
children.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to consider policy to encourage and incentivize the
development and operation of 24-hour and/or extended hour childcare centres in
Vancouver.
B. THAT Council direct staff to add a question to applications related to
development or licensing of childcare, to survey and measure the interest these
stakeholders may have in future applications to provide 24-hour childcare
models, if specific policy was implemented.
C. THAT Council direct staff to explore the possibility of supplementing current
requirements for licensed childcare centres to include specific considerations and
requirements for childcare offering 24-hour or extended care models, including
overnight and weekend childcare.
D. THAT Council direct staff to explore the possibility of Provincial funding specific
to 24-hour or extended hour Childcare in the City of Vancouver.

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, February 10 and 18, 2021 53

UNANIMOUSLY (Vote No. 06997) with Councillor Kirby-Yung abstained from the vote and

FINAL MOTION AS APPROVED
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. The current City Council has identified Childcare as a top priority;
2. Increasing safe and affordable childcare spaces in all Vancouver
neighbourhoods is essential for families with young children;
3. In December 2018 Council unanimously supported the motion “Building a Family
Friendly Vancouver: Affordable Child Care”. Staff are currently working on the
direction from this motion and will report back to Council with recommendations
hopefully in 2021;
4. The availability of quality childcare is essential to Vancouver’s work force and
affects Vancouver’s economy;
5. Canadian cities located in Ontario and Quebec do have licensed childcare
centres providing 24-hour childcare models. Both provincial governments have
provided subsidies. The high demand for extended hour childcare is supported
by significant waitlist. For example, a 24-hour licensed childcare centre located in
Barrie, Ontario opened with 70 licensed spots in 2015 and has a steady waitlist
of approximately 800 children;
6. Many families with young children, including single-parent families, work on
various shift patterns, including overnight and on weekend shifts;

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, February 10 and 18, 2021 54
7. Many families requiring childcare due to work outside of traditional hours are also
low income and single parent families. These families often must make
arrangements for childcare that are not ideal, stable and/or come at a greater
cost than families who are supported;
8. The expense of childcare is greater than the expense of housing for many
families with young children living in the City of Vancouver;
9. Although zoning does not exclude licensed childcare centres that wish to operate
24 hours, the current requirements for childcare at the City of Vancouver does
not include guidelines that address space necessary for extended hour or 24
hour childcare models, including overnight sleeping areas; and
10. The Provincial government has committed funding from the Childcare BC’s New
Spaces Fund for the Tamitik Status of Women (TSW) in Kitimat, a 24-hour
childcare facility that is expected to open in 2022. The licensed facility will offer
60 new spaces and provide childcare for infants and toddlers and school-age
children.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to consider policy to encourage and incentivize the
development and operation of 24-hour and/or extended hour childcare centres in
Vancouver.
B. THAT Council direct staff to add a question to applications related to
development or licensing of childcare, to survey and measure the interest these
stakeholders may have in future applications to provide 24-hour childcare
models, if specific policy was implemented.
C. THAT Council direct staff to explore the possibility of supplementing current
requirements for licensed childcare centres to include specific considerations and
requirements for childcare offering 24-hour or extended care models, including
overnight and weekend childcare.
D. THAT Council direct staff to explore the possibility of Provincial funding specific
to 24-hour or extended hour Childcare in the City of Vancouver.
E. THAT Council direct staff to include this work in the workplan, report back and
recommendations to Council on the actions passed in the motion “Building a
Family Friendly Vancouver: Affordable Child Care” or earlier, if possible.
F. THAT Council direct the Mayor to send a letter to the Premier as well as the
Minister of Education and the Minister of State for Childcare expressing Council’s
support for the widely endorsed Community Plan for a Public System of
Integrated Early Care and Learning (supported now by 65 local BC governments
and 34 school districts including the VSB) - known as $10 a day Plan which,
based on evidence and research, calls for a public system of high quality
affordable child care where educators are fairly compensated.
