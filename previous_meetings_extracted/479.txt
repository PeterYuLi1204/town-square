2. Vancouver Civic Theatres Visioning Road Map
MOVED by Councillor Dominato
SECONDED by Councillor De Genova
WHEREAS
1. The Vancouver Civic Theatres Board is committed to supporting the vitality,
accessibility and financial health of Vancouver’s largest suite of city-owned live
performance venues as well as its vibrant arts scene;
2. Vancouver Civic Theatres’ operations and revenues have been severely
impacted by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, as has the entire cultural
community and downtown core;

Council Meeting
Minutes, June 21, 2022 19
3. The Vancouver Civic Theatres Board has embarked on a significant internal
visioning process to review and re-imagine the future of these venues;
4. The Vancouver Civic Theatres Board has produced a summary document,
"Vancouver Civic Theatres 2021 Visioning Road Map,” which outlines the results
of this process and presents a preliminary plan for potential next steps for its
realization;
5. The Vancouver Civic Theatres Board recognizes this plan reflects an internal
visioning process intended to spark dialogue among stakeholders that now
needs be shared with the broader for community for input. Further, that this
critical stakeholder engagement process is not within the Vancouver Civic
Theatres Board’s purview;
6. At the Thursday, April 21, 2022, meeting of the Vancouver Civic Theatres Board,
a motion specific to the Board’s visioning process and the 2021 Visioning Road
Map was unanimously supported with several recommended follow up actions for
Vancouver City Council to consider, namely:
• Vancouver City Council reviews and considers the ideas and projects
proposed in “Vancouver Civic Theatres 2021 Visioning Road Map” document
produced by the Vancouver Civic Theatres Board;
• Vancouver City Council requests that City Management and Cultural Services
review the Vancouver Civic Theatres 2021 Visioning Road Map to assess
how these projects align with current and future strategies outlined in the
City’s Culture I Shift plan, and that they develop a budget for initial seed
funding to address next steps, including initial stakeholder consultation,
feasibility studies, preliminary business planning, and relevant research.
These funds could potentially be repaid through funding sources outlined in
the Visioning Road Map;
• Once the above-noted staff review has been completed, Vancouver City
Council appoints a steering committee to explore and lead major performing
arts capital projects congruent with the goals outlined in the Vancouver Civic
Theatres 2021 Visioning Road Map; and
• Suggested committee membership would include representation from City
management, Cultural Services, City Planning, Vancouver Civic Theatres,
key performing arts stakeholders, and other members at large with skills and
experience in theatre/cultural management, fundraising and development,
urban planning and architecture.
7. The City’s cultural ecology and cultural community are evolving and undergoing
major changes, many of which are presently under review and/or being
addressed by City policies and programs; and
8. Downtown Vancouver has faced unprecedented challenges as a result of the
coronavirus pandemic, which call for a revitalization that renews the City Centre
as a compelling area to work, live, and visit, regenerating economic activity and
reinforcing our cultural vibrancy.

Council Meeting
Minutes, June 21, 2022 20
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED

Theatres 2021 Visioning Road Map and the related recommendations from the
Vancouver Civic Theatres Board.
B. THAT Council direct staff to review and consider the specific recommendations

2022, motion and The Vancouver Civic Theatres 2021 Visioning Road Map,
including consideration of potential opportunities that coincide with and/or could
be implemented as part of the City’s Culture | Shift Strategy and as part of any
future strategies related to arts and culture facilities;

3. Street Care, Not Street Sweeps: Ending Daily Displacement in Vancouver
MOVED by Councillor Swanson
SECONDED by Councillor Boyle
WHEREAS
1. “Street Sweeps” refer to the daily practice of City Engineering Workers and
Vancouver Police Department officers moving throughout the Downtown Eastside
(DTES), notionally in order to ‘clean’ City property and private property;
2. In reality, Street Sweeps perpetuate a cycle of displacement that diminishes the
dignity, safety, and well-being of people who rely on public space, undermining
efforts by community organizations and the City of Vancouver to meaningfully
support people experiencing housing precarity. In contrast, City of Vancouver
micro-cleaning grants address neighbourhood litter and/or debris;
3. City of Vancouver Engineering staff are currently directed to dismantle temporary
structures and to remove structures and personal belongings from the area.
These practices are detailed in the Safe Operating Procedure - Dismantling of
Transient Camps. The City of Vancouver Safe Operating Procedure outlines

Council Meeting
Minutes, June 21, 2022 21
storage protocols for bicycles only. Currently, there are no low-barrier storage
facilities available to people who rely on public space. Similarly, there is no
accessible or identifiable facility where people can retrieve possessions that have
been taken during Street Sweeps;
4. The most recent Metro Vancouver Homeless Count (2020) identified over 2,000
people as homeless. Of these, over one-quarter were unsheltered, and 52% of
those unsheltered individuals resided in the Downtown Eastside. Unsheltered
residents of Vancouver must fend for themselves in encampments, parks,
sidewalks, and other public spaces. Even those residents who have access to
overnight shelter may be forced into public space during the day, often with all
their possessions;
5. Community members have highlighted how the Street Sweeps fail to abide by
the City’s own protocols, including not providing adequate notice when
confiscating personal property, as detailed in the report #StopTheSweeps:
Ending Cyclical Displacement and Criminalized Poverty in Vancouver. The
findings of this report reflect interviews with 85 people who rely on public space
in the Downtown Eastside. The Vancouver Area Network of Drug Users (VANDU)
has also gathered firsthand information on the impact of street sweeps through
interviews collected in the Downtown Eastside during May and June 2022;
6. Street Sweeps can infringe on constitutional and human rights law in two main
ways: by endangering people’s lives and security of the person, in violation of
section 7 of the Charter; and by discriminating against protected groups,
including Indigenous people, Black people, People of Colour, drug users,
2SLGBTQ+ and people with disabilities. The practice of displacing people and
confiscating and presumably destroying their possessions, could be
unconstitutional, against human rights law, and grounds for a civil lawsuit based
on the seizure and destruction of private property;
7. The negative impacts of Street Sweeps on low-income and street-involved
communities in Vancouver have been widely-documented as a harmful practice.
There have been reports of family memorabilia (i.e. photos of children, ashes),
identification documents, survival gear (i.e. blankets, sleeping bags, sleeping
pads, tents and tarps), assistive devices (i.e. walkers), and other personal
possessions inappropriately confiscated and destroyed by Street Sweeps;
8. The City of Vancouver, and therefore its staff and employees, cannot breach the
constitutional and human rights of unhoused residents, nor its common law
obligations to them. Street Sweeps policies, procedures, and associated job
descriptions force workers to violate the rights of unhoused residents; and
9. The City of Vancouver is committed to Reconciliation and implementation of the
UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People (“UNDRIP”). The unsheltered
community is disproportionately Indigenous, and Indigenous community

Council Meeting
Minutes, June 21, 2022 22
members are therefore disproportionately subject to Street Sweeps. The
displacement of Indigenous people from unceded land, and the disposal of their
personal property - including items of cultural and ceremonial significance, as
well as the items detailed above - must be recognized as genocidal.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council ask staff to continue to engage community partners, specifically
the Alternatives to Street Sweeps Working Group (Coalition of Peers Dismantling
the Drug War, VANDU, WAHRS, Pivot Legal Society, individuals with lived/living
experience) to develop and implement a non-punitive and community-led
alternative to Street Sweeps that does not displace people who rely on public
space.
B. THAT Council direct staff to work with the Alternatives to Street Sweeps Working
Group to create directives related to the confiscation of belongings from people
who rely on public space and systems of accountability for their implementation,
in recognition that this practice has continued potential for harmful and
discriminatory impacts. These directives must apply to City staff and community-
based organizations. Best practices include giving at least 24 hours notice of
seizure and providing a receipt with details what was taken, and clear
instructions on how to retrieve personal belongings.
C. THAT Council direct staff to identify and develop appropriate storage facilities for
DTES community members, along with an appropriate budget item for the 2023
City budget, with a twofold purpose: ongoing storage and storage of justifiably
confiscated belongings. These facilities must be secure, easily accessible, of an
adequate size, and informed by best practices and cultural safety for people who
rely on public space.
D. THAT Council direct staff to identify how to expand permanent parklets, seating
areas, green and blue spaces, hygiene facilities (i.e. washroom trailers), garbage
disposal sites, and other public outdoor amenities such as covered cooking
facilities, and cultural programming sites throughout the DTES, along with an
appropriate budget item for the 2023 City budget, as these are essential public
spaces.
E. THAT Council direct Engineering Services to identify total funds currently
allocated to the Vancouver Police Department for street sweeps, and develop a
work plan that redistributes these resources and funds to peer-based initiatives
that can carry out micro-cleaning initiatives in affected areas.
F. THAT Council ensure all programming and policies that impact Indigenous
people are implemented in compliance with UNDRIP, Declaration on the Rights
of Indigenous Peoples Act, and the City of Vancouver’s Reconciliation goals.

Council Meeting
Minutes, June 21, 2022 23
G. THAT Council instruct staff to examine section 71A of the Streets and Traffic
bylaw which prohibits structures on streets and sidewalks and bring
recommendations back to Council to make the section consistent with the human
and Charter rights of people who have no homes.
H. THAT Council request that the Mayor write to the Province to advocate for the
addition of “social condition” as a protected ground in BC’s Human Rights Code,
as recommended by the Office of the Human Rights Commissioner.

The City Manager responded to questions.
4. Strengthening the City of Vancouver’s Ethical Purchasing Policy
MOVED by Councillor Boyle
SECONDED by Councillor Swanson
WHEREAS
1. When Vancouver City Council adopted a policy on ethical purchasing in 2005,
the then City Council said:
“The goal of the City of Vancouver’s Ethical Purchasing Policy (EPP) is to ensure
that all suppliers to the City meet, at a minimum, the performance standards
outlined in the Supplier Code of Conduct, which includes core labour conventions
of the International Labour Organization (ILO). It demonstrates a commitment to
sustainability by seeking to ensure safe and healthy workplaces for the people
who make products for the City of Vancouver, where human and civil rights are
respected. The EPP also ensures that purchasing activities are aligned with the
City’s Mission Statement and Values. The policy establishes an avenue whereby
complaints of abuses in workplaces that are involved in the manufacture of
apparel and agricultural products purchased by the City can be made to the City.
The City will determine the level and the degree necessary to investigate and act
upon complaints. The policy is not intended to interfere with the City’s collective
agreements.”;
2. The complaint-driven stance adopted by the City of Vancouver so far has led in
at least two known instances of suppliers approved to sell to the City being

Council Meeting
Minutes, June 21, 2022 24
involved in serious labour abuses without the City knowing about these serious
breaches. Two Haitian factories that appear on the City of Vancouver’s list of
suppliers as of March 2021 failed to forward health insurance fees deducted from
worker salaries to the appropriate health insurance program, leading to seriously
ill workers being denied health care and subsequently dying. These deaths and
the abuse of worker rights that led to them did not become known to the City of
Vancouver until concerned citizens brought this lethal oversight to the attention of
City. There is, currently, no reason to be certain that other suppliers on the City’s
list have not committed similar or more egregious abuses of workers;
3. The experience of cities like San Francisco point to the usefulness of an active
approach including regular liaison with unions and human rights advocates in
source countries in enforcing ethical purchasing. And point to the usefulness of
contracting some elements of policy enforcement to a specialist non profit NGO
such as the Workers’ Rights Consortium, which has performed well for San
Francisco;
4. Over the life of the Ethical Purchasing Policy (EPP), the City has not retained the
services of an outside body to ensure that suppliers the City purchases from are
in compliance with the EPP; and
5. The current approach relies on suppliers to proactively provide information which
may be at odds with their business interest.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council directs staff, within three months to obtain cost estimates from
organizations such as the Workers’ Rights Consortium to:
i. Monitor the list of City of Vancouver apparel suppliers and advise the City
if any of these suppliers are in breach of the City’s EPP;
ii. Advise the City as to whether or not any potential suppliers the City is
considering contracting with are in compliance with the City’s EPP.
B. THAT Council direct staff to report back with recommendations on creating a
volunteer ethical purchasing oversight committee made up of members drawn
from local unions and human rights Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and
other relevant expertise. With the intention that the committee would liaise
regularly with the City of Vancouver’s Procurement and Supply Chain
Management staff, as well as with relevant labour and human rights
organizations and report annually to council on enforcement of the City’s ethical
purchasing policy.

5. Amending By-Law No.11529 Mayor and Councillor Expenses to Clearly Define
Eligible and Prohibited Uses of Discretionary Funds
MOVED by Councillor Dominato
SECONDED by Councillor De Genova
WHEREAS
1. The City of Vancouver and Vancouver City Council are committed to the
principles of transparency, accountability, and good governance, and to ensuring
that these core principles are embedded within, and applied to, all City processes
and activities;
2. Discretionary funds are allocated to the Mayor and Councillors for a variety of
eligible expenses. The discretionary expenses of Vancouver’s Mayor and
Councillors are outlined and enabled in the City’s By-law No. 11529 (Mayor and
Councillor Expenses);
3. PART 5 of By-law No. 11529 (Mayor's Discretionary Expenses) states under
section 5.1 that “the Mayor’s discretionary expenses are eligible expenses if
incurred by the Mayor or by the Mayor's staff, while carrying out eligible activities,
and may include” – among other things – communications expenses, fees for
consulting or other contracted services, costs of research and information
gathering, and costs of community outreach and events;
4. PART 7 of By-law No. 11529 (Councillor Discretionary Expenses) states under
section 7.2 that “Councillor discretionary expenses are eligible expenses if
incurred by one or more Councillors while carrying out constituency activities
related to eligible activities and not provided for elsewhere in this By-law, and
may include…”
(a) communications expenses
(b) fees for consulting or other contracted services
(c) costs of research and information gathering
(d) costs of community outreach and events
5. Provincially, each Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) receives an annual
office allowance to run the day-to-day operations of their respective constituency
offices. This office allowance covers operating expenses, including office staff
payroll and discretionary expenses;

Council Meeting
Minutes, June 21, 2022 26
6. Similar to the discretionary funds allocated to the Mayor and Councillors under
By-law No. 11529, Members of the Provincial Legislature are able to use their
constituency office allowance for communications with constituents, “which can
be in the form of a newsletter, household flyer, or advertisement (e.g., print,
online, radio, or television)”;
7. The content of advertisements and messages sent by Members of the Provincial
Legislature to their constituents is specifically, and unambiguously, restricted “to
announcing or reporting on constituency office activities, how to contact the
Member, the role played by the Member in the legislative process, and services
provided by the Member to constituents. Members may not use constituency
office resources or funds to distribute or mail physical or digital content which
promotes partisan or political messages or solicits financial support.”;
8. Unlike the clearly defined prohibitions on Members of the Provincial Legislature,
whereby they are not allowed to use constituency office resources or funds “to
distribute or mail physical or digital content which promotes partisan or political
messages or solicits financial support,” the City’s current By-law does not
adequately and clearly define the limits and/or appropriate expenditures and
uses of Mayor and Councillor discretionary funds; and
9. In the absence of clear definitions as to the scope of eligible expenses, which
has proven to be too broad and open to interpretation, the potential exists for
misuse and/or inappropriate use of public dollars for partisan purposes –
perceived or otherwise – which can only serve to erode trust in government and
the integrity of government processes.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to review By-law No. 11529
(Mayor and Councillor Expenses), with reference to Parts 5 and 7, and make
recommendations to strengthen the By-law with respect to eligible and prohibited use of
discretionary funds;
FURTHER THAT Council direct staff to report back with their analysis and
recommendations by or before the end of Q4 2022.

2. Provincial Apology for Sixties Scoop
MOVED by Councillor Fry
SECONDED by Councillor De Genova
WHEREAS
1. The Sixties Scoop refers to the forcible removal of thousands of Aboriginal
children from their families and communities, initiated under a mandate for
Aboriginal child protection legislated to the provinces in 1951 that continued until
the mid-1980s;
2. The Sixties Scoop could be considered a successor to the residential school
system, where middle-class Euro-Canadian perspectives on child welfare and a
strategy of assimilation saw Aboriginal children placed in care and adopted to
non-native families; 1
3. In his 1985 report 2 on Aboriginal child apprehension and the Sixties Scoop,

5. As part of a travelling exhibit “Bi-Giwen: Coming Home. Truth Telling From the
Sixties Scoop” the Sixties Scoop Indigenous Society of Alberta 4 have requested
local governments in B.C. call on the provincial government for a formal apology.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct the Mayor to write the Premier of British Columbia,
acknowledging the trauma and cultural genocide of the Sixties Scoop on
communities, families, and children and request the province make a formal
apology for their role in that injustice.
B. THAT the following be submitted as a late resolution to the UBCM 2022
Convention:
WHEREAS The Sixties Scoop refers to the forcible removal of thousands
of Aboriginal children from their families and communities, a Provincial
strategy of assimilation that saw Aboriginal children placed in care and
adopted to non-native families beginning in 1951 and continuing until the
mid 1980s.
AND WHEREAS In his 1985 report on Aboriginal child apprehension and
the Sixties Scoop, Manitoba Provincial Justice Edwin Kimelman
referenced the UN Genocide Convention of 1948 concluding that “cultural
genocide has taken place in a systematic, routine manner.” The
governments of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta have all since
apologized to the survivors of the Sixties Scoop.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT the UBCM request the province
of British Columbia make a formal apology to the communities, families
and survivors of the Sixties Scoop.
