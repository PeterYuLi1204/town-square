Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, Tuesday, December 12, 2017 41
B. Motions on Notice
1. Preserving Livable/Usable Space in One and Two Family Homes
MOVED by Acting Mayor Louie
SECONDED by Councillor Jang
WHEREAS
1. The City of Vancouver is committed to addressing climate change by reducing
greenhouse gas emissions from building operations, including measures to
increase the amount of thermal insulation;
2. The by-law amendments proposed by staff in November 2017, including an
exclusion of 2% of floor area for one and two family houses, in response to the
Council motion of February 2017, referencing changes in the Building By-law,
were not intended to address previous floor area exclusions in the Zoning and
Development By-law related to insulation or rain screen construction, or the
effect of changes to the Building By-law before 2014;
3. A floor area exclusion for thermal insulation meeting the Building By-law was
introduced in 2008 in Vancouver but not in other jurisdictions when typical wall
construction in British Columbia increased by approximately two inches or 2%
of area, and was rescinded in 2015 when typical construction increased by
approximately two inches further to meet new insulation requirements;
4. Since 2008 the typical wall in a one or two family house has increased in depth
by approximately four inches or 4% of area to accommodate the increased
insulation requirements of the Building By-law;
5. A floor area exclusion for walls designed to control building envelope leaks
through rain screen construction was previously available to one and two family
houses in the Zoning and Development By-law;
6. The exclusion of floor area from detached houses that meet the minimum
requirements of the Building By-law may have unintended impacts such as
increasing their built volume which may affect available green space and
neighbourhood fit, and increasing their sale price which may make future
transitions to increased densities of dwelling units more difficult;
7. The City of Vancouver includes an aging population and is committed to
ensuring accessibility for the elderly and those persons with disabilities;
8. The accessibility requirements for one and two family houses in the 2014
Building By-law may affect the usable dimensions of some rooms, particularly
on small lots;
9. A number of one and two family house builders have expressed support for
meeting accessibility needs but have expressed an interest in exploring
solutions that provide flexibility to maintain usable space.

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, Tuesday, December 12, 2017 42
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to bring forward recommendations to adjust the
Zoning By-law to maintain previously available usable space in small one and
two family houses prior to the 2008 adopted Zoning By-law and future
contemplated insulation and rain screen requirements during the regulatory
review planned for 2018.
B. THAT Council direct staff to explore opportunities to provide flexibility in
meeting accessibility needs in order to maintain the amount of usable space
prior to the introduction of the accessibility provisions in the 2014 Building By-
law for small one and two family houses as part of the planned regulatory
review in 2018;
FURTHER THAT the review be done in consultation with the Persons With
Disabilities Advisory Committee, the Seniors’ Advisory Committee and other
community stakeholders.
CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY (Vote No. 02453)
2. West Point Grey Rental Density for Students and Seniors
MOVED by Councillor Bremner
SECONDED by Councillor De Genova
WHEREAS
1. The 3 year housing strategy (2018-2021) identifies changes to the city's low
density neighborhoods as a high priority;
2. The 10 Year Housing Strategy includes allowing low rise housing forms in low
density neighborhoods and supports creation and expansion of “missing middle”
housing;
3. The 10 year housing strategy identifies the need to “...deliver large increases
in rental, social, and ground-oriented market housing across the city.” as part
of Priority Area 1;
4. There is a shortage of available housing for elderly residents seeking smaller
housing options to replace their existing single-family homes;
5. There is a shortage of available housing near the University of British Columbia
for both students and faculty;
6. This shortage has resulted in students and faculty commuting long distances,
leading to congestion on the road and transit works, loss of productivity and
increased greenhouse gas emissions;

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, Tuesday, December 12, 2017 43
7. The current system of rezoning individual lots for comprehensive development
is a major source of uncertainty, delay and costs for small and medium-sized
builders;
8. The City of Vancouver currently forbids homes on lots smaller than 12,000 or
18,000 square feet in northwest Point Grey (NWPG hereafter), and homes in
this area typically sell for upwards of $20M as a result;
9. Displacement of low-income residents is of primary concern, and is exceedingly
unlikely to occur in wealthy areas such as NWPG.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT the General Manager of Planning, Urban Design and
Sustainability be instructed to direct staff to prepare a proposed application and staff
report in support of amendments to the Zoning and Development By-law and Parking
By-law to rezone Northwest Point Grey (NWPG) north of 4th Avenue and west of Blanca
Street and revise applicable policies and regulations in order to consider:
• Increasing the diversity of low-rise housing forms allowed in NWPG
• Continuing to allow single-family homes outright
• Allowing 6-storey multi-family buildings up to 3 FSR, provided they are any of
the following:
Secured market rental housing
o
Social housing
o
Seniors supportive or assisted housing
o
• Reducing or eliminating parking minimums on parcels within 800 metres of a
frequent transit stop (defined as every 15 minutes or less on weekdays)
Eliminating parking minimums for secure market rental housing, social
o
housing, or seniors housing. According to research by Metro Vancouver
renter households are more likely use public transit
• A new District Schedule for NWPG based on the proposed schedule attached as
Appendix A to the motion on the Regular Council meeting agenda of December
12, 2017, entitled “West Point Grey Rental Density for Students and Seniors”
• Applying an appropriate fixed Community Amenity Contribution (CAC) to any
floor space above what is currently allowed under RS-1 zoning
• Basing this approach on the precedent in the Norquay Village RM-9 zone
• Determining the exact amount of CAC through consultation
• Reducing CACs for the preservation and creation of public amenities
• Basing this approach on recouping land lift for use by the City, while providing
certainty and a minimum of red tape for developers.
FURTHER THAT staff be directed to report back to Council with the report as soon as is
practicable in order for Council to consider referring the matter to a public hearing.
