treatments (e.g. wider sidewalks, green infrastructure, street trees, curb bulges,

access to the park; and enhance the public realm, walking, and cycling
connections throughout the neighbourhood, as outlined in this report; and that

planning process to pursue improvements in the near-term before the
Prior/Venables Street underpass is completed.

which is intended to be one general purpose through-traffic lane in each
direction.

capital investment priorities for the next 10-15 years, including investments in
community facilities, and parks and open spaces, and report back to Council in

At the Regular Council meeting on October 1, 2019, Council referred the following motion to the
Standing Committee on City Finance and Services meeting on October 2, 2019, in order to hear
from speakers, with a start time of 6 pm.

MOVED by Councillor Boyle
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. The City of Vancouver recognizes that the safety and wellbeing of children is of
the utmost importance;
2. The city is growing. Over the next 30 years, we’re expecting about 130,000 new
residents and close to 90,000 new jobs, bringing more trips and more life to the
city. The street infrastructure is largely built out, leaving few opportunities for
building new roads;
3. The increased use of non-arterial roads adjacent to schools and parks is
creating increased concerns over the safety of children and pedestrians;

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, October 2 and 22, 2019 23
4. The City of Vancouver’s Transportation 2040 Plan, envisioned a city with a
smart and efficient transportation system that supports a thriving economy while
increasing affordability; healthy citizens who are mobile in safe, accessible, and
vibrant city; and a city that enhances its natural environment to ensure a healthy
future for its citizens and the planet. The Transportation 2040 Plan identified the
following goals:
a. Move toward zero traffic-related fatalities;
b. Promoting healthy citizens in a safe, accessible, and vibrant city;
c. Promoting a city that enhances its natural environment, ensuring a
healthy future for its people and the planet;
5. The City’s Engineering department has a School Active Travel Planning (SATP)
program, and school safety is part of the City’s “Moving Towards Zero” traffic-
related fatalities program as well as the “Grandma on the Move” traffic safety
campaign;
6. The City and the Vancouver School Board recently signed an MOU for a two-
year pilot for a school active travel coordinator, after a couple years of discussion
and work to figure out scope and details. This City-funded position will work
closely with the district to improve active travel within our schools;
7. In May 2019, Council unanimously approved a Pilot project for 30km/hour speed
limits on select streets;
8. Despite being involved in fewer than 2% of collisions, pedestrians make up the
majority of transportation related fatalities (45%);
9. The financial burden of physical inactivity is substantial, costing the provincial
health care system more than $570 million in 2005. We can help reverse this
trend by making active transportation choices like walking and cycling more
convenient and comfortable, so that physical activity becomes part of the daily
rhythm of life;
10. Increasing the visibility and viability of walking or rolling to secondary and
elementary schools decreases accessibility barriers to vulnerable and minority
communities;
11. The promotion and introduction of walking and rolling transportation options at an
early age promotes active lifestyles later in life;
12. Climate change is already having impacts around the world, and conditions will
worsen unless greenhouse gas emissions are sharply reduced. Replacing
vehicle trips with safe walking, rolling, and cycling modes would reduce the
probability of vehicle accidents, help reduce carbon emissions, increase physical
activity, and promote vibrant neighbourhoods;
13. In the City of Vancouver, vehicles account for over 30% of greenhouse gas
emissions;

Minutes, Wednesday, October 2 and 22, 2019 24
14. The Transportation 2040 Plan. The 2012 Pedestrian Safety Report provided
useful transportation safety information, but did not focus explicitly on school
zones;
15. Vancouver City Council is considering launching a City-wide Planning Process,
where prior, City Council has expressed key goals and objectives to guide a city-
wide planning effort, which includes:
a. Maintaining Vancouver as a diverse and inclusive community;
b. Enhancing social well-being;
c. Addressing the city’s transportation needs;
d. Improving public amenity provisions;
e. Rapidly reducing green-house gas emissions to help tackle the climate
crisis;
f. Enhancing sociable and safe places for people and vibrant livable, well-
designed neighbourhoods.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT City Council direct staff to collaborate with the
Vancouver School Board and report back on recommendations for improving
transportation safety in Vancouver’s school zones, while actively promoting walking or
rolling to schools. This report should include:
a. A review of current infrastructure and City policies pertaining to
pedestrian and cyclist safety around Vancouver’s schools, any necessary
infrastructure or policy changes to ensure increased safety of children,
staff and families, and proposed budgets and timelines;
b. Engagement and consultation with the public, schools and Parent
Advisory Councils (PACs), the District Parent Advisory Council (DPAC),
local and Provincial Public Health authorities, and the City’s
Transportation Advisory Committee;
c. Specific standards that can be applied to all schools including for speed
zone reductions, traffic calming, pedestrian crossings, and cycling
infrastructure;
d. Where recommendations for future work (particularly speed zones) could
require support from Legal staff or from the Vancouver Police
Department, that should be outlined in the report;
e. This report back happen within the 2019/2020 school year;
FURTHER THAT Council direct the Mayor to write a letter to the Provincial Ministers of
Education and Transportation informing them of Council’s goal of improving
transportation safety around schools, and request their support and participation.

Minutes, Wednesday, October 2 and 22, 2019 28
8. Back to Basics: Prioritizing Public Realm Maintenance and Cleanliness in
Vancouver
At the Regular Council meeting on October 1, 2019, Council referred the following motion to the
Standing Committee on City Finance and Services meeting on October 2, 2019, in order to hear
from speakers, with a start time of 6 pm.
The Committee heard from one speaker in support for the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. The maintenance and cleanliness of roads, street medians, and sidewalks, as
well as the management of litter and litter receptacles in the public realm, are
among the core – most basic – jurisdictional responsibilities of local governments
such as the City of Vancouver;
2. Under the heading “Street and sidewalk cleaning and maintenance”, the City of
Vancouver website states that “Keeping our streets, sidewalks, and green spaces
safe and clean for everyone to enjoy is a City priority;”;
3. In recent years, the people who live and work in Vancouver, as well as visitors to
our city, have noted and openly commented on a significant decline in the
physical state and cleanliness of our city, offering up and reporting on numerous
examples such as streets with potholes, overgrown street medians, and
neglected sidewalks that represent a variety of safety hazards, and the increased
amount of litter on sidewalks, overflowing garbage cans, and discarded food
items that attract insects and other pests, all of which has resulted in the
diminishment of basic civic pride and confidence in the day-to-day management
of the City;
4. In July 2019, Vancouver City Council approved the 2020-2024 Budget Outlook,
signalling the start of the annual budget process that seeks to align available
funds with the priorities and service level expectations of the people who live and
work in Vancouver;
5. The City of Vancouver regularly refocuses its spending in response to changes in
service demands and priorities over time, and, when necessary and informed by
feedback from the public, public consultation and other valued sources, the City
makes new investments in emerging issues;
6. Residents and businesses in Vancouver are genuinely dismayed that while the
taxes and fees levied by the City of Vancouver constantly go up, services appear
to continually diminish, and that the city appears dirty and neglected from the
perspective of basic maintenance and commonly accepted standards of
cleanliness;

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, October 2 and 22, 2019 29
7. The majority of the funds to cover the cost of the annual City of Vancouver
budget – i.e. the money the City uses to run the city – come from property taxes
and utility fees collected from homeowners and businesses, as well as from
renters through the rent paid to landlords;
NOTE: Under the City of Vancouver 2019 Operating Budget, a median
single-family home assessed at $1,832,000 paid an estimated $3,805 in
total City of Vancouver taxes and fees in 2019 while a median business
property assessed at $618,000 paid an estimated $5,512 in total City
taxes and fees (this amount does not include Provincial taxes and fees
collected by the City for the Province);
8. The people who live and work in Vancouver have a reasonable expectation that
the taxes and fees they pay to the City of Vancouver will be used to appropriately
maintain Vancouver’s roads, sidewalks and street medians, and to keep them in
a state of good repair and cleanliness, along with prompt attention to the removal
of litter and attending to public litter receptacles in a timely manner;
9. In 2017, Dillon Consulting Limited conducted a “Street Litter Audit” for the City of
Vancouver at 108 pre-selected locations in the city and observed that the most
common categories for large litter were cups (20%) and paper/fibre material
(19%) while the most common categories for small litter were cigarette
butts/debris (37%) and chewing gum (25%), with large litter items being equal to
or larger than 4 square inches and small litter items being smaller than 4 square
inches;
10. The City of Vancouver website prominently lists “Improved street cleaning,
including more litter and recycling receptacles” and “Cleaner parks with improved
litter pick-up” as being among the many benefits derived from the City’s annual
budgets – notably stating that the benefits from taxes and fees paid to the City
accrue “in your home, on your street, in your community, and throughout your
city;”
11. The Vancouver Board of Parks and Recreation plays a key role, and is a key
partner of the City of Vancouver, in keeping the city’s public realm clean and in a
good state of repair, notably the city’s traffic medians and shared spaces that the
Park Board maintains for the City of Vancouver under a contract service
arrangement;
12. Gaining physical access to street medians has become increasingly difficult for
the Park Board (e.g. Knight Street), as has access to the necessary financial
resources to achieve a proper standard of maintenance;
13. In 2017, the City of Vancouver implemented a new “Street Cleaning Utility fee”
with the stated purpose to reduce illegal dumping and create cleaner and safer
public realm spaces;

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, October 2 and 22, 2019 30
14. The City’s website states: “Garbage illegally dumped in a laneway – if not
cleaned up promptly – attracts more garbage. Abandoned garbage can also
cause health and environmental risks, sends a message that illegal activity is
tolerated in our neighbourhoods and costs taxpayers over a million dollars a
year;”
15. The City’s stated commitment to “Keeping our streets, sidewalks, and green
spaces safe and clean for everyone to enjoy” as a City priority is best
demonstrated through action and a jurisdictionally appropriate emphasis and
prioritization of maintenance and cleanliness standards in conjunction with the
most prudent and effective use of taxpayer dollars.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Vancouver City Council direct staff to elevate the priority given to the
maintenance of the City’s roads, street medians, and sidewalks, and that this be
a key guiding element in the preparation of the City’s 2020 Budget, with an aim to
improve the state of good repair and safety and cleanliness of these assets,
including direction to staff to take immediate steps to elevate the priority given to
sidewalk repair and street litter removal and public litter receptacles in
accordance with the reasonable expectations of the people who live and work in
Vancouver for the public realm to be well maintained, safe and clean;
FURTHER THAT Council direct staff to bring forward as part of the 2020 Budget
process the expenditures required to achieve the maintenance and cleanliness
objectives noted above, including a proposed reallocation of funds from other
City of Vancouver budget items of lesser public impact and effectiveness (noting
that such reallocation of funds need not be restricted to the streets and sanitation
portion of the City’s Budget), that would not add to the total tax load imposed on
the City’s taxpayers through taxes and fees that are yet to be levied in the City’s
2020 Budget.
B. THAT Council direct staff to report back prior to the presentation of the 2020
Proposed Budget with an update on any and all impediments that may exist for
the Park Board as it relates to its ability to fulfill the contracted maintenance of
the city’s street medians, including recommendations for how these impediments
can be overcome in a timely and cost-effective manner.
C. THAT Council direct staff to report back prior to the presentation of the 2020
Proposed Budget on the “Street Cleaning Utility fee” implemented in 2017, a fee
that sought to reduce illegal dumping and create cleaner and safer public realm
spaces, including information on how the funds have been applied, results
achieved, and an identification of areas where additional support is required to
achieve the desired results, such that the level of safety and cleanliness in the
public realm is fully consistent with the reasonable expectations of those who live
and work and pay taxes and fees in Vancouver.

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, October 2 and 22, 2019 31
D. THAT Council signal its ongoing commitment to the timely and sufficient
maintenance and cleanliness of the city’s roads, sidewalks and street medians to
keep them in a state of safety and good repair, as well as the effective and
prompt management of street litter and litter receptacles in the public realm, by
directing staff to include language in the City’s proposed 2020 Operating Budget
that keeping our streets, sidewalks, and public spaces safe and clean for
everyone to enjoy is a Council priority and among the core jurisdictional
responsibilities of the City of Vancouver.

FINAL MOTION AS APPROVED
WHEREAS
1. The maintenance and cleanliness of roads, street medians, and sidewalks, as
well as the management of litter and litter receptacles in the public realm, are
among the core – most basic – jurisdictional responsibilities of local governments
such as the City of Vancouver;
2. Under the heading “Street and sidewalk cleaning and maintenance”, the City of
Vancouver website states that “Keeping our streets, sidewalks, and green spaces
safe and clean for everyone to enjoy is a City priority;”
3. In recent years, the people who live and work in Vancouver, as well as visitors to
our city, have noted and openly commented on a significant decline in the
physical state and cleanliness of our city, offering up and reporting on numerous
examples such as streets with potholes, overgrown street medians, and
neglected sidewalks that represent a variety of safety hazards, and the increased
amount of litter on sidewalks, overflowing garbage cans, and discarded food
items that attract insects and other pests, all of which has resulted in the
diminishment of basic civic pride and confidence in the day-to-day management
of the City;
4. In July 2019, Vancouver City Council approved the 2020-2024 Budget Outlook,
signalling the start of the annual budget process that seeks to align available
funds with the priorities and service level expectations of the people who live and
work in Vancouver;
5. The City of Vancouver regularly refocuses its spending in response to changes in
service demands and priorities over time, and, when necessary and informed by
feedback from the public, public consultation and other valued sources, the City
makes new investments in emerging issues;
6. Residents and businesses in Vancouver are genuinely dismayed that while the
taxes and fees levied by the City of Vancouver constantly go up, services appear
to continually diminish, and that the city appears dirty and neglected from the
perspective of basic maintenance and commonly accepted standards of
cleanliness;
7. The majority of the funds to cover the cost of the annual City of Vancouver
budget – i.e. the money the City uses to run the city – come from property taxes
and utility fees collected from homeowners and businesses, as well as from
renters through the rent paid to landlords;
NOTE: Under the City of Vancouver 2019 Operating Budget, a median
single-family home assessed at $1,832,000 paid an estimated $3,805 in
total City of Vancouver taxes and fees in 2019 while a median business

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, October 2 and 22, 2019 33
property assessed at $618,000 paid an estimated $5,512 in total City
taxes and fees (this amount does not include Provincial taxes and fees
collected by the City for the Province);
8. The people who live and work in Vancouver have a reasonable expectation that
the taxes and fees they pay to the City of Vancouver will be used to appropriately
maintain Vancouver’s roads, sidewalks and street medians, and to keep them in
a state of good repair and cleanliness, along with prompt attention to the removal
of litter and attending to public litter receptacles in a timely manner;
9. In 2017, Dillon Consulting Limited conducted a “Street Litter Audit” for the City of
Vancouver at 108 pre-selected locations in the city and observed that the most
common categories for large litter were cups (20%) and paper/fibre material
(19%) while the most common categories for small litter were cigarette

10. Expediting an Elementary School for the Olympic Village Community – the City’s
Role
At the Regular Council meeting on October 1, 2019, Council referred the following motion to the
Standing Committee on City Finance and Services meeting on October 2, 2019, in order to hear
from speakers, with a start time of 6 pm.
The Committee heard from three speakers in support for the motion.

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, October 2 and 22, 2019 35
MOVED by Councillor Dominato
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. The City of Vancouver, together with the Vancouver School Board (VSB), has
long planned for a school to be built in the Olympic Village, to support the
objectives of creating a diverse, vibrant community where individuals, families,
and children can live and thrive;
2. The City of Vancouver’s Official Development Plan (ODP) for South East False
Creek anticipated that an elementary school for the Olympic Village would be
built in concert with other core amenities and, as one of several stated goals for
the project, be in place by 2020;
3. Schedule A of the Southeast False Creek Official Development Plan (April 2007)
includes numerous references to an elementary school, including:
• Section 4.3.5 (Cultural, recreational, and institutional uses) states:
“Development is to include the following facilities: (a) one K-7 community
elementary school having a floor area of at least 3 700 m2 , and
including a gymnasium in area 2A;”
• Section 4.4 (Phasing of parks and community facilities) states: “Phasing
decisions for the parks, community centre and non-motorized boating
centre, and other community facilities are to happen at the time of the
applicable CD-1 re-zonings; and are to include every effort to co-
ordinate delivery of the elementary school in a time frame compatible
with the delivery of such other facilities;”
• Section 5.4.2 (Area 2A – The central “shipyard” neighbourhood) states:
“… A cluster of community services via Front Street and the seaside
greenway/bikeway are to connect to the community heart. Such services
are to include a community centre combined with a non-motorized
recreational boating facility and day care facility to animate the waterfront
and an elementary school, which may include more child care and
after-school care, located within easy walking distance of the
community centre and boating facility and beside the park that is to
be large enough for a playfield. The waterfront park near the school is
to provide a community demonstration garden including garden plots and
sustainability education lessons for children and adults.”
4. The development of the Southeast False Creek community was intended to be “a
leading model of sustainable development” – a “complete neighbourhood” with
goods and services within walking distance, and housing and jobs that are
accessible by transit;
5. Southeast False Creek was designed as a mixed-use community, with a total
population of 11,000 – 13,000 people, with a focus on residential housing;

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, October 2 and 22, 2019 36
6. The reasonable expectation that an elementary school would be in place for the
Olympic Village community by 2020, as noted in the South East False Creek
ODP, led many to choose the Olympic Village as a neighbourhood where they
could build their lives and livelihoods and start families;
7. To date, an elementary school for the Olympic Village community has received
neither approval nor funding from the provincial Ministry of Education;
8. The existing catchment school for the Olympic Village neighbourhood – Simon
Fraser Elementary – is significantly overcapacity and receives nearly three times
the in-catchment applications for kindergarten than it can handle;
9. The overcapacity conditions at Simon Fraser Elementary are forcing families to
send students to schools well outside their neighbourhood, with students
attending more than two dozen different schools throughout the city,
exacerbating traffic congestion and air pollution in a city that strives to be the
greenest city in the world while seriously undermining the human connections
between students, friends, and neighbours that are the foundation of a healthy,
thriving community;
10. Many other Olympic Village families are simply giving up on the prospect of a
neighbourhood school being built in time for their children to attend and are
therefore moving from the community to more established areas where there are
existing schools – a loss to the Olympic Village community and to these young
families alike;
11. In June 2018, Education Minister Rob Fleming stated that he wants to see the
Vancouver school district build schools more quickly and noted that it takes
longer to build schools in Vancouver – five years – than in other districts, such as
Surrey, where it takes about three years;
12. In May 2018, the VSB considered a motion, brought forward by Trustee Lisa
Dominato, calling on the City of Vancouver to fast-track development and
building permits for Vancouver schools (new schools, replacements, additions,
and renovations) by means of a “Nexus” style fast-track approval process – the
motion failed narrowly in a tie vote;
13. There is currently no City of Vancouver policy that prioritizes applications for
building and development permits for the Vancouver school district. The school
district’s applications are processed alongside permit applications for all city
developments including commercial, single family dwellings, laneways,
condominium developments, housing projects, and community centres;
14. In May 2018, it reportedly took – on average – 12 months for the school district to
receive a development permit and 8 months to receive a building permit for new
and replacement schools, which added more than one year to school capital
projects;
15. Last year, the VSB entered into an agreement with BC Hydro whereby a
subsurface parcel at the Lord Roberts Annex site was sold to accommodate a
much needed electrical substation in the West End / Downtown core;

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, October 2 and 22, 2019 37
16. A portion of the VSB proceeds from the Lord Roberts Annex site subsurface sale
agreement with BC Hydro will go toward the capital cost of a new school in Coal
Harbour, which means the Province has saved money on a capital expenditure
and could re-allocate that funding to build an Olympic Village Elementary school;
17. In Year One of the VSB 2020/21 Capital Plan, the school district is seeking
Ministry of Education approval for the acquisition of a school site for a South East
False Creek / Olympic Village Elementary school;
18. It is crucially important that funding for an elementary school in Olympic Village
be secured and made available as soon as possible to get the school project
underway, and the City of Vancouver has various tools and potential options
available within its jurisdictional domain to do its part and to help accomplish this
longstanding goal for the South East False Creek community.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to create a “fast-track” process, on an urgent basis,
whereby the approval of development and building permits for Vancouver
schools (new schools, replacements, additions, and renovations) can be
expedited to ensure that Vancouver school facilities can be built, replaced, added
to, and/or renovated in a timely manner, to help build strong, diverse, sustainable
neighbourhoods and communities in our city, with staff to report back to Council
by January 2020 regarding actions taken in this regard.
B. THAT Council direct staff to work with the Vancouver School Board staff to
explore ways to work together on a collective basis to improve and streamline
various City approval processes in pursuit of the timely construction,
replacement, and/or renovation to Vancouver Schools, including an elementary
school in Southeast False Creek / Olympic Village.
C. THAT Council call on the Province to prioritize capital funds for a new school in
South East False Creek / Olympic Village, on an urgent basis, acknowledging the
pressing need for a school in this area, as well as the fact that the Vancouver
School Board (VSB) is fully funding the new Coal Harbour school through
proceeds from the Lord Roberts Annex site subsurface sale by the VSB to
BC Hydro which relieves the Province of this related capital expense.
D. THAT Council acknowledge its role and responsibility to ensure that there is
adequate and appropriate space for the learning needs of our city’s youngest
residents, and that Council direct staff to explore the possibility of:
i. Leasing the City-owned land in Southeast False Creek/ Olympic
Village, on an urgent basis, to the Vancouver School Board for a
nominal sum as a means to expedite construction of a
long-anticipated elementary school in lieu of a direct acquisition
through a sale or land transfer;

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, October 2 and 22, 2019 38
ii. Enabling the construction of a “modular school” if a lack
provincial funding or other delays fail to address the school
facility needs of the Southeast False Creek / Olympic Village
neighbourhood in a timely manner.
E. THAT a copy of this motion to be sent to the Trustees and Senior Staff of the
Vancouver School Board.
