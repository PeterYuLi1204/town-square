The Court of Revision also had before it the following two submissions from the agent on
behalf of the Appellant, First Baptist Church of Vancouver (on file in the City Clerk’s Office):
• Rebuttal to City of Vancouver “Book of Evidence”; and
• Case Summary: Assessor of Area No. 09 v. Alsco Canada Corp.
Iain Dixon, Assistant Director - Regulatory Litigation, Legal Department, and Marty Radakovich,
Deputy Collector of Taxes, Finance, Risk and Supply Chain Management, were present on behalf
of the City of Vancouver (the City). Paul Sullivan and Bruce Evans-Atkinson, both of Burgess,
Cawley, Sullivan & Associates Ltd., were present as agent on behalf of the Appellant. Steven
Milos, Treasurer, First Baptist Church of Vancouver, was also present on behalf of the
Appellant.
Mr. Dixon provided an overview of the Land Averaging Appeal process pursuant to Section 9 of
By-Law No. 11759, the 2017 Land Assessment Averaging By-law, and Council’s role sitting as a
Court of Revision pursuant to Section 10 of the By-law. Mr. Dixon advised that this was an
appeal which alleged an error by the Collector of Taxes in the application of the Land
Averaging By-law to the property set out in the agenda. He added that the role of the Court
of Revision in this case was to determine whether the By-law had been appropriately applied
to the property and whether the appeal should be allowed or dismissed.
Mr. Sullivan submitted that there was no change to the classification of the property from
Class 1 to Class 6, as there had been no change in property use or zoning, but rather there
was a correction and, therefore, removal of the property from land averaging was an error
which produced an ‘absurd’ result, adding the property taxes increased from $9,000 to
$284,000 or 3,155%. He noted the massive increase in the Appellant’s property value was due
to the City adopting the West End Plan, however, with the exception of the Appellant’s
property, all other affected properties remained under land averaging.

Special Council Meeting
Minutes, Thursday, October 19, 2017 3
Mr. Sullivan referred to Case Summary: Assessor of Area No. 09 v. Alsco Canada Corp.,
Section 42, to demonstrate the fact that the 3,155% tax increase produced an absurd
consequence for the Appellant. He also referred to Appendix A, page 4 of the staff report
contained in the City’s evidence brief under Tab 1, noting he had never encountered a
tribunal that ruled against the taxpayer in every case since its legislation began.
Mr. Radakovich presented the City’s position along with Mr. Dixon and responded to
questions.
Mr. Evans-Atkinson referred to the City’s evidence brief, in his review of the legislation and
taxation related to the property, and reiterated Mr. Sullivan’s argument that there was no
change to the classification of the property from Class 1 to Class 6.
Mr. Evans-Atkinson responded to questions.

The Court of Revision recessed at 3:03 pm, and reconvened at 3:08 pm.

Note: During the recess, Mr. Sullivan left the Court of Revision.
Mr. Milos provided clarification on the evidence put forth by the City in relation to the
property use, noting the property is no longer being used for public parking. He also reviewed
the impacts the tax increase would have on the Church’s ability to serve the community.
Mr. Milos responded to questions.
In closing, Mr. Dixon referred to Case Summaries: Canada Trustco Mortgage Co. v. Canada,
and 65302 British Columbia Ltd. v. Canada, which both dealt with legislative interpretation,
and reminded the Court of Revision that its role was to determine whether the By-law was
appropriately applied to the property and whether the appeal should be allowed or dismissed.
Mr. Dixon responded to questions.
* * * * *
The Court of Revision recessed at 3:48 pm, and reconvened at 3:53 pm.
* * * * *
Mr. Evans-Atkinson, in his closing summation, felt the Court of Revision had the power to
address this matter and that Council could request the By-law be rewritten when it comes
forward in 2018. He asked that, of all the appeals the City has had on land assessment
averaging over the years, the Court of Revision reconsider and support this appeal.
