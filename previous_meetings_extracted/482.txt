BY THE REQUIRED MAJORITY

MOVED by Councillor Swanson
WHEREAS
1. Human rights organizations and advocates in British Columbia and across
Canada (including BC’s Office of the Human Rights Commissioner, the British
Columbia Civil Liberties Association, West Coast Leaf, BC Poverty Reduction
Coalition, Centre for Gender and Sexual Health Equity, Community Legal
Assistance Society, Immigration and Refugee Legal Clinic, Migrant Workers
Centre BC, SWAN Vancouver, Prisoners’ Legal Services, as well as hundreds of
lawyers, academic scholars, healthcare providers, and people from various faith
communities), and international organizations Human Rights Watch and Amnesty
International, are calling for Canada to stop incarcerating immigration detainees
in provincial jails;
2. Over the past five years, Canada has detained tens of thousands of individuals
under immigration law while they await the resolution of their immigration or
refugee matters, including children, survivors of severe trauma or persecution,
and persons with disabilities including mental health conditions;
3. In a June 2021 joint report, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International
documented serious human rights violations within the Canadian immigration
detention system. People in immigration detention are regularly handcuffed,
shackled, and held with little to no contact with the outside world in some of the
country’s most restrictive confinement conditions, including maximum security
provincial jails and solitary confinement;
4. Canada has no legislated limit to the length of time people can be held in
immigration detention, so they can be held for months or years with no set
release date;
5. There are viable alternatives to incarcerating people for immigration matters in
provincial jails, as demonstrated when authorities released significant numbers of
people from immigration detention early on in the pandemic;

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, June 8, 15 and 16, 2022 15
6. Many people placed in immigration detention are already embedded in their
communities and have the resources and support they require, including
housing. Immigration detention is not a form of housing. In fact, many people are
removed from their homes, families, communities, and employment when they
are placed in immigration detention. For people who are detained on arrival or
shortly after arriving in Canada, immigration detention interferes with their ability
to access effective legal advice and representation, secure housing and
employment, connect with friends and family members, and become settled in
the community;
7. The federal government pays BC a $235 per diem for each immigration detainee
held in provincial jail. These funds could instead be used to invest in community-
based organizations that provide support rather than surveillance. Such
organizations include Rainbow Refugee and the Vancouver Association for
Survivors of Torture, which provide access to housing, legal representation,
counselling, medical services, language classes, and employment search
support. Organizations like Kinbrace also provide services tailored to refugee
claimants in the community while they await resolution of their applications;
8. In March 2022 submission to BC Corrections, BC’s Office of the Human Rights
Commissioner stated that the ableism and racism embedded in the current
immigration detention system mean that people with disabilities and racialized
people experience harsher treatment and are detained for longer periods of time.
According to the Commissioner, there is strong evidence that current practices
contravene BC’s Human Rights Code and international human rights
conventions;
9. The severe mental health consequences of immigration detention are
consistently recognized in medical literature in Canada and abroad.
Imprisonment in a penal institution has adverse effects on health, particularly for
people with pre-existing mental health conditions, including those seen among
survivors of trauma and persecution;
10. Canada’s federal government has sole legal responsibility for border
enforcement and immigration detention. However, a significant number of people
in immigration detention are held in provincial jails on the basis of agreements
between the federal government and provincial authorities. By virtue of these
agreements, the provinces are implicated in human rights violations against
immigration detainees incarcerated in provincial jails;
11. In an April 2022 joint legal memorandum, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty
International found that Canada’s practice of incarcerating immigration detainees
in provincial jails is inconsistent with international human rights standards, and
jail conditions potentially breach federal-provincial immigration detention
agreements;
12. Between fiscal years 2017-18 and 2019-20, hundreds of immigration detainees
were held in BC provincial jails, most of them in Allouette Correctional Centre for
Women, Fraser Regional Correctional Centre, and North Fraser Pretrial Services

Minutes, June 8, 15 and 16, 2022 16
Centre;
13. BC Corrections is currently reviewing The BC government’s 2017 agreement with
the Canada Border Services Agency which allows for immigration detainees to
be incarcerated in BC provincial jails. According to article 13(3) of the agreement,
either signatory can cancel the agreement without explanation or penalty, with a
year’s written notice;
14. In accordance with the report recently published by the Special Committee on
Reforming the Police Act, titled Transforming Policing and Community Safety in
British Columbia, community safety requires the full decriminalization of
immigration status; and
15. The City of Vancouver has an Access to City Services without Fear policy “to
support access to City services by Vancouver residents with uncertain or no
immigration status and who fear detention, psychological and physical harm, or
deportation, when accessing services.” But people who are incarcerated in
immigration detention cannot access city services.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council ask the Mayor to write to the BC
Minister of Public Safety, Mike Farnworth, urging him to respect the provincial
government’s human rights obligations by terminating its immigration detention
agreement with the Canada Border Services Agency;
FURTHER THAT Council ask the Mayor to write to the federal government urging it to,
rather than paying per diems for incarceration, to adequately fund community-based
organisations that provide tailored and compassionate support, including rights-
respecting alternatives to detention;
AND FURTHER THAT Council ask the Mayor to write to the federal government urging it
to abolish immigration detention.

Urging the BC Government to End Its Immigration Detention Contract with the
Canada Border Services Agency
WHEREAS The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) has used Provincial prisons to

strong evidence that current practices contravene BC’s Human Rights Code and
international human rights conventions.

Services Agency, stop incarcerating immigration detainees in BC jails, and call on the

membership in the Federation of Canadian Municipalities and the Union of BC
Municipalities.
CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY (Vote No. 08474)
(Councillors De Genova, Hardwick, Kirby-Yung and Wiebe absent for the vote)
FINAL MOTION AS APPROVED
WHEREAS
1. Human rights organizations and advocates in British Columbia and across
Canada (including BC’s Office of the Human Rights Commissioner, the British
Columbia Civil Liberties Association, West Coast Leaf, BC Poverty Reduction
Coalition, Centre for Gender and Sexual Health Equity, Community Legal
Assistance Society, Immigration and Refugee Legal Clinic, Migrant Workers
Centre BC, SWAN Vancouver, Prisoners’ Legal Services, Justice for Girls and
Rainbow Refugee, as well as hundreds of lawyers, academic scholars,
healthcare providers, and people from various faith communities), and
international organizations Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, are
calling for Canada to stop incarcerating immigration detainees in provincial jails;
2. Over the past five years, Canada has detained tens of thousands of individuals
under immigration law while they await the resolution of their immigration or
refugee matters, including children, survivors of severe trauma or persecution,
2SLGBTQ+ people, survivors of severe trauma or persecution, and persons with
disabilities including mental health conditions;
3. In a June 2021 joint report, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International
documented serious human rights violations within the Canadian immigration
detention system. People in immigration detention are regularly handcuffed,
shackled, and held with little to no contact with the outside world in some of the
country’s most restrictive confinement conditions, including maximum security
provincial jails and solitary confinement;
4. Canada has no legislated limit to the length of time people can be held in
immigration detention, so they can be held for months or years with no set
release date;
5. There are viable alternatives to incarcerating people for immigration matters in
provincial jails, as demonstrated when authorities released significant numbers of
people from immigration detention early on in the pandemic;
6. Many people placed in immigration detention are already embedded in their
communities and have the resources and support they require, including
housing. Immigration detention is not a form of housing. In fact, many people are

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, June 8, 15 and 16, 2022 19
removed from their homes, families, communities, and employment when they
are placed in immigration detention. For people who are detained on arrival or
shortly after arriving in Canada, immigration detention interferes with their ability
to access effective legal advice and representation, secure housing and
employment, connect with friends and family members, and become settled in
the community;
7. The federal government pays BC a $235 per diem for each immigration detainee
held in provincial jail. These funds could instead be used to invest in community-
based organizations that provide support rather than surveillance. Such
organizations include Rainbow Refugee and the Vancouver Association for
Survivors of Torture, which provide access to housing, legal representation,
counselling, medical services, language classes, and employment search
support. Organizations like Kinbrace also provide services tailored to refugee
claimants in the community while they await resolution of their applications;
8. In March 2022 submission to BC Corrections, BC’s Office of the Human Rights
Commissioner stated that the ableism and racism embedded in the current
immigration detention system mean that people with disabilities and racialized
people experience harsher treatment and are detained for longer periods of time.
According to the Commissioner, there is strong evidence that current practices
contravene BC’s Human Rights Code and international human rights
conventions;
9. The severe mental health consequences of immigration detention are
consistently recognized in medical literature in Canada and abroad.
Imprisonment in a penal institution has adverse effects on health, particularly for
people with pre-existing mental health conditions, including those seen among
survivors of trauma and persecution;
10. Canada’s federal government has sole legal responsibility for border
enforcement and immigration detention. However, a significant number of people
in immigration detention are held in provincial jails on the basis of agreements
between the federal government and provincial authorities. By virtue of these
agreements, the provinces are implicated in human rights violations against
immigration detainees incarcerated in provincial jails;
11. In an April 2022 joint legal memorandum, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty
International found that Canada’s practice of incarcerating immigration detainees
in provincial jails is inconsistent with international human rights standards, and
jail conditions potentially breach federal-provincial immigration detention
agreements;
12. Between fiscal years 2017-18 and 2019-20, hundreds of immigration detainees
were held in BC provincial jails, most of them in Allouette Correctional Centre for
Women, Fraser Regional Correctional Centre, and North Fraser Pretrial Services
Centre;
13. BC Corrections is currently reviewing The BC government’s 2017 agreement with
the Canada Border Services Agency which allows for immigration detainees to

be incarcerated in BC provincial jails. According to article 13(3) of the agreement,
either signatory can cancel the agreement without explanation or penalty, with a
year’s written notice;
14. In accordance with the report recently published by the Special Committee on

9. Dual Licenses, Cocktail Culture, and Vibrant Urban Nightscapes (Member’s Motion
B.3)
At the Council meeting on June 7, 2022, Council referred the above- noted motion to the
Standing Committee on City Finance and Services meeting on June 8, 2022, in order to hear
from speakers, followed by debate and decision. Subsequently the meeting recessed on June 8,
2022, and reconvened on June 15 and 16, 2022.
On June 15, 2022, at 3:05 pm, Councillor Wiebe rose to declare a Conflict of Interest on Item 9
as he has interest in the Port Side Pub which is a liquor primary. He left the meeting for the
duration of Item 9 and returned at 4:05 pm.
The Committee heard from six speakers in support of the motion and one speaker who spoke
about other aspects of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Fry
WHEREAS
1. A vibrant and mixed nighttime economy can encourage tourism, boost the local
economy, and contribute to shaping places where people live, work, and play;
2. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly undermined the viability and vitality of
Vancouver’s nighttime economy and entertainment districts. The result of less
nighttime visitors and activity has resulted diminished economic returns and
employment, and seen a marked increase in vandalism, property destruction,
and concerns for public safety;

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, June 8, 15 and 16, 2022 22
3. Large destination nightclubs –- once a significant driver of the nighttime economy
-- have been experiencing a decline since before the pandemic. Areas like the
Toronto Entertainment District and Granville Entertainment District (GED) have
been seeing steady diminution of nightclubs in response to changing tastes, land
use priorities, economics, and what some analysts refer to as the
commercialization and 'McDonaldisation’ of urban nightlife leaving consumers
with an increasingly standardized experience; 1
4. Experiential hospitality has filled the place of club culture, offering different
themes, culinary, and cocktail experiences. Instead of binge drinking and loud
crowded nightclubs; many consumers are seeking out cozier and more intimate
spaces to gather and enjoy drinks, a meal, or late-night cocktails;2
5. Many restaurants (experiential or otherwise) will pursue a dual license that
enables a licensed restaurant (Food Primary) to convert to a bar or lounge later
in the evening (Liquor Primary). This allows the establishment to stay open and
serve patrons later, but not have to keep an otherwise unnecessary full kitchen
open and staffed;
6. The City of Vancouver classifies bars and lounges as Liquor Establishments and
variously as:
a. Class 1, where the person capacity does not exceed 65;
b. Class 2, where the person capacity does not exceed 150;
c. Class 3, where the person capacity does not exceed 300;
d. Class 4, where the person capacity does not exceed 500;
e. Class 5, where the person capacity does not exceed 950; and
f. Class 6, where the person capacity exceeds 950;
7. Under the BC Liquor Control and Licensing Act (2017), dual licensing allows that
a service area may be subject to both a Liquor Primary and a Food Primary
licence as long as the licences are held by the same licensee. Food Primary
licensees can apply to the Liquor and Cannabis Regulation Branch (LCRB) for a
Liquor Primary licence at the same location to operate as a bar or nightclub after
a specified hour;3
8. The City of Vancouver supports dual licensing applications from existing Food
Primaries (FP) to operate under Liquor Primary (LP) licences after 10:00 pm
provided that they meet the City’s existing procedural and policy standards for LP
establishments;
9. The City of Vancouver supports dual licensing applications EXCEPT for Food
Primaries in the DTES and GED, where there exists a moratorium on new LP
licenses. Notwithstanding the two moratoria, the City otherwise provides input on
all LP licence applications to the LCRB;4
10. The DTES and GED moratoria were introduced in 2012 and 2017 respectively. In
both cases the rationale was that a high concentrations of establishments serving
liquor posed immediate harms to neighbourhood residents and visitors, such as
violence associated with intoxication, and nuisance. These problem

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, June 8, 15 and 16, 2022 23
establishments were typically designed and operated as LP operations, generally
large nightclubs and beer parlours. The moratoria did not consider dual licensing
for FP establishments, market trends, or pandemic recovery;
11. Notwithstanding the moratoria and licensing limitations, many (relatively) newly
opened FP Vancouver bars and restaurants in Chinatown and Gastown are
winning international awards and accolades,5 contributing to vibrant nightscape,
the animation of struggling and moribund districts, and local economy and
employment. Dual licensing would benefit most if not all of these FPs by allowing
reduced overhead and extended hours, and contributing direct and indirect
activation and stewardship of their respective nightscapes; and
12. Since the 2012 and 2017 moratoria, Council have given support to develop A
Comprehensive Strategy for Realizing the Full Potential of the Nighttime
Economy in the City of Vancouver,6 and enable pandemic recovery by way of
One Time Exceptions to Liquor Primary Establishment Distancing and
Moratoria.7
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to lift the moratoria on Liquor Primary licensing in the
DTES and GED specifically to allow eligible Food Primary licensees to apply for
Dual Licensing for Class 1 and 2 Liquor Establishments only, under the regular
citywide and provincial terms and conditions, allowing for additional
considerations specific to the DTES and GED as necessary and expected.
B. THAT Council direct staff to report back in one year with any findings and
recommendations resulting from new dual licensing program in the DTES and
GED by Q2 2023.
amended
AMENDMENT MOVED by Councillor Swanson
THAT A be struck from the motion;
FURTHER THAT B be stuck and replaced with the following:
B. THAT Council direct staff to report back in one year after consulting with the
Chinatown community including the Legacy Stewardship Group and businesses
with cultural and food assets and other interested groups and businesses, with
any findings and recommendations related to the possibility of lifting the
moratoria on Liquor Primary licensing in the DTES and GED for eligible food
primary licencees.

conditions, allowing for additional considerations specific to the DTES and GED
as necessary and expected, as well as allowing new Dual Licenses to be

FURTHER THAT B be stuck and substituted with the following:
B. THAT Council direct staff to report back in one year with any findings and

10. Scaling Seniors Housing Needs in False Creek South (Member’s Motion B.4)
At the Council meeting on June 7, 2022, Council referred the above-noted motion to the
Standing Committee on City Finance and Services meeting on June 8, 2022, in order to hear
from speakers, followed by debate and decision. Subsequently the meeting recessed on June 8,
2022, and reconvened on June 15 and 16, 2022.
On June 15, 2022, the Committee heard from three speaker in support of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Fry
WHEREAS
1. In False Creek South nearly one in three residents are above the age of 65,
proportionately double that of Vancouver as a whole. There are over 2150
seniors (65 years and over) in the False Creek South Census Tract.1 This is
35.9% of the area’s population – up from 30.4% in the 2016 Census – and more
than double the 17% of the City as a whole;
2. It is anticipated that the population in False Creek South and the surrounding
areas will age significantly over the coming decade and beyond. BC’s population
continues to age, and the relative proportion of senior population is increasing.
Province-wide, seniors are expected to represent 27 per cent of B.C.’s population
by 2038;2
3. As residents age in place in False Creek South, there are very few opportunities
for them to move into appropriate ‘right-sized’ housing, forcing them to otherwise
stay in affordable housing that could be freed up for families. Through thoughtful
and proactive planning there is an opportunity and imperative to provide
appropriate housing and services so that seniors and people with disabilities can
age in their community;
4. The Broadway Lodge and the Residences for Independent Living Society –
(RILS) have successfully provided care and housing for seniors and adults with
disabilities respectively in False Creek South for over 40 years. Both currently
lease parcels of City-owned land in False Creek South, with the lease
agreements for their current facilities expiring in 2036 and 2040;
5. Currently, the Broadway Lodge is the only long term care home in False Creek
South or anywhere between Arbutus and Main and north of Broadway. The lodge
currently provides 114 beds, but the facilities are aging and operators estimate
they will need to be substantially upgraded by 2030;
6. The Broadway Lodge and the Residences for Independent Living Society have
joined together to form the Broadway Group in order to provide a better economy

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, June 8, 15 and 16, 2022 28
of scale and development capacity to support the ageing population of False
Creek South, and propose a vision for the future in a Campus of Care;
7. As more seniors are living to 85 and beyond, an increasing number of individuals
will face limitations and long-term health challenges. This will put increasing
pressure on all levels of government to ensure adequate support, in areas such
as housing, health care and home care, as well as transportation, among other
things. These demographic trends are predicting a substantial growth in the
population of seniors in BC, and there are expected to be an increasing
provincial investment in new Long Term Care beds, which will peak in the second
half of the 2020’s. With support and certainty, the Broadway Group could be well
positioned to capture some of this investment to support their vision for a
Campus of Care;
8. The City of Vancouver’s Future of False Creek South: Advancing a Conceptual
Development Plan and Addressing Lease Expiries report received by Council in
October 2021 identified the importance of Community care facilities and special
needs housing, with direction to prioritize working with housing operators and
other levels of government, to secure replacement units in the community; and
9. On 28 October 2021, Council unanimously resolved to provide supportive or
culturally appropriate housing for vulnerable and marginalized populations,
including seniors and people with disabilities in False Creek South, as part of the
Future of False Creek South: Advancing a Conceptual Development Plan and
Addressing Lease Expiries amended recommendations.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct the General Manager of Arts,

11. Emergency Actions to Protect SRO Tenants from Displacement to Save Lives
(Member’s Motion B.5)
At the Council meeting on June 7, 2022, Council referred the above-noted motion to the
Standing Committee on City Finance and Services meeting on June 8, 2022, in order to hear
from speakers, followed by debate and decision. Subsequently the meeting recessed on June 8,
2022, and reconvened on June 15 and 16, 2022.
On June 16, 2022, the Committee heard from six speakers in support of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Swanson
WHEREAS
1. Single Room Occupancy (SRO) hotels constitute housing of last resort before
homelessness for many of the city’s most vulnerable residents;
2. A variety of factors are currently leading to rapid displacement of tenants from
several SRO buildings, including atrocious building conditions, fire, extreme
vulnerability of some tenants and development pressures;
3. One Hotel (Winters) recently closed due to a massive fire in Gastown, and it is
not clear if section 4.8 (a) of the Single Room Accommodation By-law allowing a
permit condition that requires a contribution to an SRA replacement fund applies
to hotels that have been destroyed by fire;
4. One SRO hotel (Cobalt), near the St Paul’s hospital development site, is being
purchased by a hotelier for the purposes of conversion;
5. The SRA By-law conversion fee was designed to pay for one unit of replacement
housing, but the current cost to replace one unit of social housing has increased
significantly above the by-law amount of $230,000/room to $300K to $500K;
6. In the context of development pressures related to the St Paul’s hospital project,
the current SRA conversion charge is not sufficient to disincentivize conversion;
7. Tenants who lose their housing at this site may be unsettled temporarily or
permanently;
8. Two SRO hotels (Lucky Lodge and Vogue Hotel) were recently emptied despite
the best efforts of advocates and the RTB investigative unit;
9. Vacancy control is slowing the rate of increase in rents but it is unfortunately
clear that existing civic and provincial legal and policy instruments are still
insufficient to prevent mass displacement and homelessness of some SRO
tenants;
10. Vulnerable tenants do not cope wwith the impact of forced moves, which create
negative impacts on their mental and physical health, especially during the

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, June 8, 15 and 16, 2022 31
poison drug crisis and the intergenerational trauma of colonialism that is taking a
huge toll on SRO tenants;
11. Tenants from the Winters were able to be relocated to the empty Columbia Hotel,
meaning that other currently homeless people can’t be located there;
12. Tripartite government partners are meeting to develop a proposal for an SRO
Acquisition and Rehabilitation planning process for privately-owned SROs to
reduce homelessness, but even once the planning process begins, it will take a
long time to complete;
13. Urgent action is need to prevent evictions until an SRO strategy is in place; and
14. The Provincially mandated emergency eviction freeze during the first phase of
the COVID-19 pandemic helped to stabilize tenants’ occupancy in SROs.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to report back with proposed amendments to the SRA
By-law to better ensure that the conversion charge applies to hotels destroyed by
fire.
B. THAT Council direct staff to report back with proposed amendments to the SRA
by-law to increase the conversion fee to a rate that is adjusted regularly to reflect
the actual cost of building one new social housing unit for every SRA unit lost.
C. THAT Council direct staff to report back with proposed amendments to the SRA
By-law to better guarantee that SRO tenants are re-housed in self-contained
social housing at shelter rate or in suitable market housing with owners topping
up the shelter rate if necessary, before SRO demolition or conversion permits
are issued.
D. THAT Council request the Mayor to urgently advocate to the province for an
emergency eviction freeze until the SRO Acquisition and Rehabilitation Process
starts providing the units people need.

12. Moving Climate Goals Forward with Micromobility (Member’s Motion B.6)
At the Council meeting on June 7, 2022, Council referred the above-noted motion to the
Standing Committee on City Finance and Services meeting on June 8, 2022, in order to hear
from speakers, followed by debate and decision. Subsequently the meeting recessed on June 8,
2022, and reconvened on June 15 and 16, 2022.
On June 16, 2022, the Committee heard from one speaker in support of the motion and two
speakers who spoke about other aspects of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
WHEREAS
1. Vancouver City Council declared a Climate Emergency in 2019 and
subsequently in November 2020, approved the Climate Emergency Action Plan.
The CEAP included six big moves, including the goal that by 2030 two-thirds of
trips in Vancouver will be made by active transportation and transit;
2. Approximately 37% of Vancouver’s carbon pollution comes from burning gasoline
and diesel in our vehicles. In order to reduce GHG’s we need to give people
more diverse and climate friendly ways to move around our city;

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, June 8, 15 and 16, 2022 34
3. The 2021 Climate Emergency Annual Report and presentation to Council
indicated a low likelihood of meeting the active transportation and transit goal;
4. In July 2020, Council approved an e-scooter micromobility pilot program that was
limited to privately owned e-scooters, and did not include consideration of or trial
of shared e-scooters, raising concerns about equity and only being available to
those can afford to purchase their own e-scooter. Shared services also have the
ability to limit speeds and other features in support of safety that private use does
not enable;
5. Since Council approved Vancouver’s limited e-scooter pilot two years ago
(following the Province’s 2019 amendment of the Motor Vehicle Act (MVA) to
allow municipalities to pilot micromobility devices such as e-scooters and e-
bikes), other municipalities such as Richmond have moved forward with shared
e-scooter programs;
6. A shared e-scooter micro-mobility pilot can be an important accelerated action in
the City’s Climate Emergency response and contribute to a multi-modal and
sustainable, people-movement ecosystem. Transit ridership is rebounding but is
still below pre-Covid levels, as people remain apprehensive about travelling in
close quarters to others, as well as due to a change in work patterns. Offering
more micromobility options can provide more choice for people and reduce car
use;
7. Micromobility is becoming more and more popular and is here to stay. Shared
mobility planning needs to be part of our climate response, new normal and new
economy. At Translink’s 2020 AGM CEO Desmond spoke to the need to
integrate with new mobility options and Translink continues to reference micro-
mobility options as important for ‘first and last mile’ of trips and as part of a
cohesive transportation eco-system;
8. The framework from the Province supports allowing the use of micromobility
devices (such as e-scooters and e-bikes) on protected bike lanes and local
streets with 30 km/h speed limits;
9. E-Scooters offer an affordable, environmentally-friendly transportation option that
expands the population willing to try active transportation instead of cars. The
National Association of City Transportation Officials (NACTO) study showed that
in the United States, despite an increase of 38.5 million shared e-scooter trips in
2018, docked bike-share (like Mobi) ridership still grew by 9% to 36.5 million
trips. As a result, shared micro-mobility trips doubled to 84 million trips nationally
in 2018. E-scooters accounted for 81% of this increase in shared active
transportation usage;
10. This complementary nature between bike-share and scooter-share is
demonstrated in survey data by the City of Portland that showed 45% of scooter
riders “never” ride a bike and 78% of scooter riders had “never” used Portland’s
ubiquitous Biketown bike-share system;

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, June 8, 15 and 16, 2022 35
11. Typical e-scooter programs in Canada include municipal fees to operate. For
example in Calgary, a $600 application fee, $15,000 security deposit and $60 per
permitted vehicle per year fee are charged to cover the costs of program
administration. Shared e-scooter services municipal agreements now include
general liability coverage as well as indemnification in the licencee agreements;
12. Deployment of shared e-scooters around transit and Skytrain stations and in
equity zones can ensure everyone can participate, by supporting residents who
are reliant upon transit as a primary mode of travel, as can incorporating equity
programs that enable access to low-income users;
13. Addition of shared e-scooter services will provide the chance to provide
additional street usage experience, as well as enable British Columbia’s largest
city to provide valuable input into shaping the Provincial government’s legislative
response to new mobility technologies (including factors such as speed limits and
where devices can operate);
14. To support accessibility and concerns about shared e-scooters resulting in
devices left on sidewalks blocking pedestrian movement, cities around the world
have resolved issues through geofencing technology to control no ride zones, set
slow zones and designated parking and no parking zones;
15. Use of modular parts on e-scooters is helping extend lifespan of shared use
scooters to five years, and recyclability of units including the batteries is being
achieved;
16. In support of zero emission transportation, more people are shown to ride shared
e-scooters than ride shared bikes. However, both are instrumental in a robust
micro-mobility system. Reducing the number of shared modes available to
people limits the number of people willing to get out of their cars, thus working
against sustainable mode share targets. This is demonstrated in Portland’s
experience where 45% of their users saying they never ride a bike and 78%
saying they never use the city’s Mobi-like bikeshare system. Portland’s 2018 pilot
similarly found that 34% of riders replaced car use with their last scooter trip. The
impact was more pronounced for visitors and tourists, of whom nearly half (48%)
reported replacing car use on their last scooter trip. Calgary’s pilot showed
750,000 trips in three months with every 3 scooter trips replacing one car trip,
and over 50% of trips ending in a Business Improvement Association area; and
17. Shared e-scooter services are working with local partners like HUB Cycling and
Brain Trust Canada to ensure that safety is at the forefront of safety
programming. For example, training mode provides new users with the
opportunity to take their first trips at a reduced speed.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff direct staff to move forward with including a public e-
scooter share service in Vancouver’s Provincial pilot project for the use of
“electric kick scooters” on protected bike lanes and minor streets to commence
by Spring 2023 that is enabled by the Street and Traffic By-law No. 2849;

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, June 8, 15 and 16, 2022 36
FURTHER THAT such a program be facilitated through a competitive RFP
process to identify a proponent/s to deliver the service with due consideration to
safety procedures, accessibility, incorporation of an equity program/measures
and indemnification of the City.
B. THAT Council direct staff to report back with results from the pilot including use,
trip length and other metrics to inform Vancouver’s future approach to the
provision of shared e-scooter services, and provide recommendations to how
enabling more climate-friendly micromobility options could support Vancouver’s
active transportation and emission reduction goals.

13. Relief for Commercial Properties Impacted by the Broadway Subway Construction
(Member’s Motion B.7)
At the Council meeting on June 7, 2022, Council referred the following motion to the Standing
Committee on City Finance and Services meeting on June 8, 2022, in order to hear from
speakers, followed by debate and decision. Subsequently the meeting recessed on June 8,
2022, and reconvened on June 15 and 16, 2022.
The Committee heard from seven speakers in support of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Hardwick
WHEREAS
1. Construction of the Broadway Subway has disrupted the business of merchants
and commercial operators along the Broadway Corridor. The loss of business
has had a profound impact on the livelihoods of both property owners and renters
of commercial space along the Broadway Corridor;
2. Merchants located adjacent to “cut and cover [wsp.com]” sites are more severely
impacted than other areas along the Broadway Corridor. Cut and cover sections
of construction restrict pedestrian, vehicle and bus access to merchants. Visibility
of businesses in cut and cover sections is severely limited and significantly
impacted;
3. Properties along the Broadway corridor are not provided with the same level of
access for customers, suppliers and deliveries. Mitigation measures have not
been effective at offsetting business losses;

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, June 8, 15 and 16, 2022 41
4. The Broadway Subway is a “design and build [dbia.org]” project, thus businesses
receive information and are consulted with only a week or two before changes
are implemented. This uncertainty adds additional pressure to adjacent
businesses operations; and
5. Other Canadian cities have addressed similar challenges associated with large
transportation infrastructure projects. For example, the City of Montreal,
QC launched a financial assistance program [montreal.ca] aimed at reducing the
impact of work sites for establishments located in areas affected by major
construction. The program is geared towards establishments in an area affected
by major construction. Its aim is to:
• Mitigate the financial impacts on merchants affected by work sites.
• Help merchants stay in business during a major infrastructure construction
period.
• Support the dynamism and commercial vitality of commercial streets under
construction.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct Staff to explore options on ways
to provide relief to commercial properties affected in the “cut and cover” locations along

FINAL MOTION AS APPROVED
WHEREAS
1. Construction of the Broadway Subway has disrupted the business of merchants
and commercial operators along the Broadway Corridor. The loss of business
has had a profound impact on the livelihoods of both property owners and renters
of commercial space along the Broadway Corridor;
2. Merchants located adjacent to “cut and cover [wsp.com]” sites are more severely
impacted than other areas along the Broadway Corridor. Cut and cover sections
of construction restrict pedestrian, vehicle and bus access to merchants. Visibility
of businesses in cut and cover sections is severely limited and significantly
impacted;
3. Properties along the Broadway corridor are not provided with the same level of
access for customers, suppliers and deliveries. Mitigation measures have not
been effective at offsetting business losses;
4. The Broadway Subway is a “design and build [dbia.org]” project, thus businesses
receive information and are consulted with only a week or two before changes
are implemented. This uncertainty adds additional pressure to adjacent
businesses operations; and

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, June 8, 15 and 16, 2022 43
5. Other Canadian cities have addressed similar challenges associated with large
transportation infrastructure projects. For example, the City of Montreal,
QC launched a financial assistance program [montreal.ca] aimed at reducing the
impact of work sites for establishments located in areas affected by major
construction. The program is geared towards establishments in an area affected
by major construction. Its aim is to:
• Mitigate the financial impacts on merchants affected by work sites.
• Help merchants stay in business during a major infrastructure construction
period.
• Support the dynamism and commercial vitality of commercial streets under
construction.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct Staff to explore options on ways
to provide relief to commercial properties affected in the “cut and cover” locations along
the Broadway Subway corridor, including relaxation or deferral of business property
taxes, revitalization tax exemptions pursuant to 396E of the Vancouver Charter, and
developing a program similar to that of the City of Montreal’s Financial assistance
program for businesses affected by major construction [montreal.ca] ;
FURTHER THAT Council request the Mayor to write to the Province and the Broadway
Subway Project Corporation requesting the exploration of options to provide relief to
commercial properties affected in the “cut and cover” locations along the Broadway
Subway corridor, including but not limited to developing a program similar to that of the
City of Montreal’s Financial assistance program for businesses affected by major
construction [montreal.ca].
