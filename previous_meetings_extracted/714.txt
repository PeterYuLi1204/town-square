Minutes, December 8 and 10, 2020 43
2. Numerous local and international reports emphasize the importance of street and
sidewalk lighting for maintaining personal safety (real and perceived), reducing
pedestrian collisions, and promoting use of public spaces;
3. Poorly maintained and inadequate street lighting is especially problematic for
vulnerable groups such as 2SLGBTQ+ individuals, women, seniors, and persons
with disabilities;
4. The City of Vancouver website states that “keeping our streets, sidewalks, and
green spaces safe and clean for everyone to enjoy is a City priority”;
5. The City of Vancouver is seeking ‘Global Age-Friendly City’ status from the World
Health Organization, which requires cities to ensure an increased standard of
safety in all public spaces;
6. In October 2019, City Council passed a motion regarding the prioritization of
public realm maintenance;
7. In 2013, the Seniors Advisory Committee’ passed a motion calling for
improvements to identification and repair of non-functioning streetlights, as well
as the addition of lighting in poorly lit areas;
8. This motion was supported by the 2SLGBTQ+, Women’s, and Persons with
Disabilities Advisory Committees;
9. City Council, in response to this motion, called on staff to report on the current
level of service for non-functioning lights and any progress made on installing
additional lighting for pedestrian safety;
10. In response, staff committed to reducing repair time from an average of 21 days
to 7 days;
11. The 2SLGBTQ+ Advisory Committee’s examination of data reveals that lights are
repaired in accordance with this new standard, but only if/when they are brought
to the attention of City staff;
12. The City largely relies on citizens to identify non-functioning lights and report
them using 311 or VanConnect;
13. Members of our communities have observed that many lights are in disrepair for
several months, especially those near commercial areas, parks, or ‘dead zones’
(e.g., between buildings);
14. Our examination of 311 incident reports confirms that some lights are in disrepair
for long periods, but are repaired shortly after a first report is made;
15. Many people are unaware of the 311 and VanConnect systems, or experience
difficulty using them (e.g., requirement for too much information, disappearance
of service requests); and

Council Meeting
Minutes, December 8 and 10, 2020 44
16. Members of our communities remain concerned that there is insufficient or
obstructed lighting in several areas throughout the city, which affects their sense
of safety and curtails their nighttime activities.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to report on the feasibility of
the following:
1. An analysis of the effectiveness of relying on 311/VanConnect to report lighting
outages (e.g., percentage of citizens that know 311/VanConnect can be used for
reporting and, of those, percentage that are actually willing to use it; the
percentage of citizens who would need to be knowledgeable about
311/VanConnect and willing to use it in order for this tool to be sufficiently
effective in identifying outages in a timely manner);
2. A renewed public education campaign, based on the analysis above, to
encourage citizens to report lighting outages using 311 or VanConnect (e.g., ads
on social media, bus shelters, and TV/radio);
3. Encouraging 311 staff to streamline the reporting process as much as possible
(i.e., do not request too much information);
4. Encouraging city crews (e.g., sanitation workers) to report outages during nightly
shifts, especially in areas where citizens may be unlikely to report (e.g.,
commercial areas, parks, and ‘dead zones’ between buildings);
5. Installing new lighting in poorly lit areas, especially sidewalk-level and alleyway
lighting in areas identified by residents as being at higher risk for public safety
concerns; and
6. Reducing the obstruction of lighting (e.g., from overhanging tree cover);
FURTHER THAT Council direct staff to consult the relevant advisory committees on
these matters including the Seniors’ Advisory Committee, Persons with Disabilities
Advisory Committee, Active Transportation Advisory Committee, and the Women’s
Advisory Committee.
