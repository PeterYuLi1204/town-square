The Committee heard from two speakers in support of the motion.

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, April 28, 2021 14
MOVED by Councillor Fry
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. Through Transportation 2040, the Climate Emergency Action Plan, and Healthy
City strategies, the City of Vancouver has the committed goal: to encourage and
support walking, cycling, and rolling so that 2/3 of all trips are made by walk,
bike, and transit by 2030;
2. Two common and popular metrics used to map attractiveness of urban locations
are Walk Score 1 and Bike Score 2. These rating systems are used by planners,
researchers, real-estate agents and prospective residents to indicate how
conducive an area is to walking or biking, on a scale of 0-100;
3. While Walk Score is determined by number and proximity of destinations or
amenities within one mile, Bike Score methodology additionally contemplates
bike lanes and road connectivity, bike commuting mode share, hills and grade;
4. In a newly published study, Determining If Walkability and Bikeability Indices
Reflect Pedestrian and Cyclist Safety 3, principal investigator Tarek Sayed, UBC
civil engineering professor and Canada Research Chair in transportation safety
and advanced mobility, writes: “Among the public, there is an implicit assumption
that ‘walkable’ and ’bikeable’ means safe for walking and biking, but these
indices do not actually include objective measures of safety”;4
5. The study, comparing walk score and bike score with pedestrian-motor-vehicle
and cyclist-motor-vehicle crashes in Vancouver, compiled 134 traffic analysis
zones using 5 years of ICBC crash data with walking, cycling, and motor-vehicle
traffic volume controls for exposure to indicate that areas of the city with higher
walkability and bikeability can be potentially associated with greater pedestrian
and cyclist crash risk, respectively, even after controlling for exposure;
6. Areas of the city found to pose the highest collision risk to pedestrians included the
downtown core, Fairview, Mount Pleasant, Strathcona and Grandview-Woodland,
which all have high Walk Scores. Areas of the city found to pose the highest
collision risk to cyclists included zones in the downtown core and in Strathcona and
Mount Pleasant, which are all rated highly on the Bike Score index;
Neighborhood walkability and bikeability scores do not indicate safety for
pedestrians and cyclists, and could be modified to better incorporate objective
risk; and
7. New, improved methods of transportation safety, risk, and attractiveness analysis
and evaluation like those being developed at UBC’s Transportation Engineering
department are helping to reshape road safety priorities here and across North
America.

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, April 28, 2021 15
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to report back on the development of a Bike Safety
index to represent both biking attractiveness and cyclist crash risk; and that:
1. The Bike Safety Index consists of bike network coverage, continuity,
complexity, signal density, and recreational density;
2. The Bike Safety Index be used as a tool to prioritize network
improvements, interventions and connection of network gaps;
3. The Bike Safety Index be used to inform signage, road markings and
information for active transportation users and motor vehicle drivers;
4. The Bike Safety Index be developed as a zone-based approach,
prioritizing high crash areas first, as part of a comprehensive city-wide
approach; and
5. The UBC Transportation Engineering research group be consulted as to
whether opportunities for their work in this field might inform or
collaborate on a safety index.
B. THAT Council direct staff to consider and report back on how a similar
“walkability” safety index might be developed to identify attractiveness and risks
in order to prioritize improvements and interventions in the public realm for all
pedestrians, including wheelchair users and other rollers.
