AMENDMENT MOVED by Councillor Wiebe
SECONDED by Councillor Dominato
THAT the following be added as G:
THAT the following be added as new condition 1.5A under the Urban Design
section, Part 1 of Appendix B of the Referral Report dated September 1, 2020,
entitled “CD-1 Rezoning: 3701-3743 West Broadway”:
“1.5A Design development to reduce its overall height by removing all
portions of the mezzanine level, amounting to a reduction of at least 4.0
ft. to the total height.
Note to Applicant: Removing the mezzanine level will bring the overall
height to 168.68 ft. The portions to be removed includes the mezzanine
level over the commercial retail units, and the upper-level of the three
townhouses along the west side of the building. This amounts to reducing
approximately 370.5 sq. m (approximately 4,000 sq. ft.) to the overall floor
area. Furthermore, some portions of the mezzanine-level circulation
corridor should also be anticipated to be removed pending egress
requirements. Reducing the upper levels of the townhouses may result in
adjustments to the overall number of residential units and the unit mix.”
