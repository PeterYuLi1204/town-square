1. Vancouver’s Social Housing Initiative
An application by the General Manager of Planning, Urban Design and Sustainability was
considered as follows:
Summary: To amend the Zoning and Development By-law to add a new relaxation and
associated regulations to permit new social housing, which includes non-
profit, non-profit co-operative, and government-owned social, supportive and
co-operative housing to be built under a development permit application. No
further Zoning and Development By-law amendments would be necessary to
enable these projects. It also proposes a new rezoning policy to enable
consideration of social housing proposals which do not fit into the standard
zoning.
