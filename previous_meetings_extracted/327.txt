3. Support for Securing the Collision Conference in Vancouver
MOVED by Mayor Sim
SECONDED by Councillor Fry
WHEREAS
1. Major conferences are a significant economic driver for the City of Vancouver.
According to Destination Vancouver, bringing the Collision Conference to
Vancouver would have an economic impact of:
• Direct Sales: $57,871,096;
• Business Sales, including in-direct: $93,871,887;
• Jobs Supported: 28,618;
• Local taxes: $1,564,024;
2. Vancouver is a tech hub with 194,000 tech workers across all industries, or
115,000 workers in the tech industry. BC’s tech employment growth was more
than double the national average over the past five years;
3. Collision Conference, produced by Web Summit, draws together world leaders in
technology, industry, art and culture, and government to discuss the future of
cutting-edge technology and its impact on business and society;
4. Collision has been called the “Olympics of Tech” and “North America's fastest
growing tech conference.” Each year it attracts more than 35,000 attendees from
130+ countries to its current host city of Toronto, driving approximately $49
million in direct spending and a further $77 million in economic impact through
investment, partnerships, and trade;

Council Meeting
Minutes, September 12, 2023 20
5. Hosting this conference, or one like it in Vancouver, would bring significant
economic and tax benefits to the city, region, and province as a whole. It would
promote tourism, generate new business opportunities, create jobs, and bring
international visibility to Vancouver's vibrant tech industry;
6. An exploratory bid process has been co-chaired by Destination Vancouver and
the Frontier Collective and supported by the Province of BC, Innovate BC,
DigiBC, Vancouver Convention Centre, the Surrey Board of Trade, Invest
Vancouver, Vancouver Economic Commission, and other key partners;
7. The exploratory bid process has been completed and after a site-tour, Vancouver
has been named a finalist host city;
8. The future home of the Collision Conference will be announced at the Web
Summit conference in Portugal in November 2023.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct the Mayor to write a letter to the
Province of British Columbia and the Government of Canada affirming the City’s
enthusiastic support for Vancouver as a potential future host of the Collision Conference;
FURTHER THAT such letter encourage the Province of British Columbia to provide
funding in support of the Vancouver bid, and for the Government of Canada to likewise
support funding for all potential host cities in Canada;
AND FURTHER THAT Council direct staff to develop a plan to ensure local benefits and
opportunities to maximize the potential of the Collision Conference (or others like it) to
strengthen Vancouver's Visitor Economy and position the city as a global leader in the
tech industry.
