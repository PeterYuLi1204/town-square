WHEREAS
1. The City of Vancouver Corporate Policy SUBJECT: Code of Conduct
CATEGORY: Employment POLICY NUMBER: AE-028-01 in section (8) titled
Breaches, Complaint Handling and Disciplinary Action (the “Code of Conduct”)
states:
“General:
8.1 Council officials, Advisory Body Members and Staff are to abide by the
requirements of the Vancouver Charter and this Code of Conduct, and shall
endeavor to resolve interpersonal disputes in good faith.
Council Officials
8.2 Alleged breaches of this Code of Conduct by Council Officials shall be
submitted in a written complaint addressed to the Mayor and/or the City Manager

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, October 1, 2019 24
within six (6) months of the last alleged breach. In the event that the Mayor is the
subject of, or is implicated in a complaint, the complaint shall be addressed to the
Deputy Mayor.
8.3 Upon receipt of a complaint under Section 8.2, the Mayor or Deputy Mayor
shall, within thirty (30) days, appoint an independent third party identified and
agreed between the Complainant(s) and Respondent(s) as having the necessary
professional skills, knowledge and experience to investigate the complaint (the
“Third Party Investigator”). The Third Party Investigator:
8.3.1 May conduct a preliminary assessment of the complaint, at the
conclusion of which the Investigator may determine to continue the
investigation or make a written recommend that the complaint be
dismissed as unfounded, beyond jurisdiction or unlikely to succeed;
If the Third Party Investigator determines to continue the complaint, the Third
Party Investigator shall:
8.3.2 Conduct an independent and impartial investigation of the complaint in a
manner that is fair, timely, confidential and otherwise accords with the principles
of due process and natural justice;
8.3.3 Provide an investigation update within ninety (90) days of his or her
appointment to the Mayor or Deputy Mayor, as applicable, and to the
Complainant and the Respondent;
8.3.4 Provide a written, confidential report (the “Report”) of the findings of the
investigation, including findings as to whether there has been a breach of this
Code of Conduct, to the Mayor or Deputy Mayor, as applicable, and to the
Complainant and the Respondent; and
8.3.5 Provide recommendations in the Report as to the appropriate resolution of
the complaint, which recommendations may include:
a) dismissal of the complaint; or
b) public censure of a Council Official or Officials for misbehaviour or a
breach of this Code of Conduct;
c) a requirement that a Council Official or Officials apologize to any
person adversely affected by a breach of this Code of Conduct;
d) counselling of a Council Official or Officials, and/or
e) such other recommendations as are deemed appropriate in the
professional judgment of the Third Party Investigator.”;
2. The Code of Conduct allows any person, including staff, the public and/or any
other elected official to file a complaint against another elected official;

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, October 1, 2019 25
3. Any and all complaints must be dealt with by the Mayor or Deputy Mayor by
appointing a “Third Party Investigator”;
4. Section 8.3 of the Code of Conduct requires the Third Party Investigator to have
the necessary professional skills, knowledge and experience to investigate the
complaint and, pursuant to Section 8.3.2, must conduct the investigation in
accordance with the legal principles of “due process and natural justice”;
5. Accordingly, a practicing lawyer with significant experience conducting workplace
investigations is typically appointed by the Mayor under the Code of Conduct to
be the Third Party Investigator;
6. Since the process is a formal legal investigation, Council members very often
need legal advice when named as a Respondent and would also benefit from
legal advice when considering making a complaint as a Complainant under the
Code of Conduct;
7. Since this a formal legal process involving interests separate from the City’s, the
City’s in-house legal counsel are not permitted to provide legal advice to
individual Councillors in these matters;
8. Thus, Councillors have in the past and continue to incur legal costs on legal
counsel in defending Code of Conduct complaints, whether or not such
complaints are dismissed by the Third Party Investigator. Councillors quite rightly
decide that it is in their best interests to have proper legal advice on such matters
even though they must bear such costs personally and even where they are of
the view that the complaint is without merit;
9. These legal costs can be significant and arise solely from a Councillor faithfully
carrying out their duties as a Councillor. Where the complaint is dismissed, it can
be a financial hardship for a Councillor to bear the legal costs of defending a
complaint that may have been motivated solely by personal or political reasons;
10. As with other expenses incurred by Councillors in the course of faithfully carrying
out their duties such legal costs should be recoverable by Councillors subject to
appropriate financial limits and conditions on eligibility.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to review the operation of the current Code of Conduct
and report back with recommendations to Council as to how the Code of Conduct
could be improved to better promote and enforce ethical standards.
B. THAT Council direct staff to also consider the inclusion of provisions for the
reimbursement of legal costs for Mayor and Councillors who are complainants or
respondents in a Code of Conduct complaint.
C. THAT, in reviewing the Code of Conduct and developing recommendations as
provided for in A and B above, Council direct staff to consider:

3. Improving Transportation Safety Around Vancouver Schools
MOVED by Councillor Bligh
SECONDED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
WHEREAS
1. The City of Vancouver recognizes that the safety and wellbeing of children is of
the utmost importance;
2. The city is growing. Over the next 30 years, we’re expecting about 130,000 new
residents and close to 90,000 new jobs, bringing more trips and more life to the
city. The street infrastructure is largely built out, leaving few opportunities for
building new roads;
3. The increased use of non-arterial roads adjacent to schools and parks is
creating increased concerns over the safety of children and pedestrians;
4. The City of Vancouver’s Transportation 2040 Plan, envisioned a city with a
smart and efficient transportation system that supports a thriving economy while
increasing affordability; healthy citizens who are mobile in safe, accessible, and
vibrant city; and a city that enhances its natural environment to ensure a healthy
future for its citizens and the planet. The Transportation 2040 Plan identified the
following goals:
a. Move toward zero traffic-related fatalities;
b. Promoting healthy citizens in a safe, accessible, and vibrant city;
c. Promoting a city that enhances its natural environment, ensuring a
healthy future for its people and the planet;
5. The City’s Engineering department has a School Active Travel Planning
(SATP) program, and school safety is part of the City’s “Moving Towards Zero”
traffic-related fatalities program as well as the “Grandma on the Move” traffic
safety campaign;
6. The City and the Vancouver School Board recently signed an MOU for a
two-year pilot for a school active travel coordinator, after a couple years of

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, October 1, 2019 27
discussion and work to figure out scope and details. This City-funded position will
work closely with the district to improve active travel within our schools;
7. In May 2019, Council unanimously approved a Pilot project for 30km/hour speed
limits on select streets;
8. Despite being involved in fewer than 2% of collisions, pedestrians make up the
majority of transportation related fatalities (45%);
9. The financial burden of physical inactivity is substantial, costing the provincial
health care system more than $570 million in 2005. We can help reverse this
trend by making active transportation choices like walking and cycling more
convenient and comfortable, so that physical activity becomes part of the daily
rhythm of life;
10. Increasing the visibility and viability of walking or rolling to secondary and
elementary schools decreases accessibility barriers to vulnerable and minority
communities;
11. The promotion and introduction of walking and rolling transportation options at an
early age promotes active lifestyles later in life;
12. Climate change is already having impacts around the world, and conditions will
worsen unless greenhouse gas emissions are sharply reduced. Replacing
vehicle trips with safe walking, rolling, and cycling modes would reduce the
probability of vehicle accidents, help reduce carbon emissions, increase physical
activity, and promote vibrant neighbourhoods;
13. In the City of Vancouver, vehicles account for over 30% of greenhouse gas
emissions;
14. The Transportation 2040 Plan. The 2012 Pedestrian Safety Report provided
useful transportation safety information, but did not focus explicitly on school
zones;
15. Vancouver City Council is considering launching a City-wide Planning Process,
where prior, City Council has expressed key goals and objectives to guide a
city-wide planning effort, which includes:
a. Maintaining Vancouver as a diverse and inclusive community;
b. Enhancing social well-being;
c. Addressing the city’s transportation needs;
d. Improving public amenity provisions;
e. Rapidly reducing green-house gas emissions to help tackle the climate
crisis;
f. Enhancing sociable and safe places for people and vibrant livable,
well-designed neighbourhoods.

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, October 1, 2019 28
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT City Council direct staff to collaborate with the
Vancouver School Board and report back on recommendations for improving
transportation safety in Vancouver’s school zones, while actively promoting walking or
rolling to schools. This report should include:
a. A review of current infrastructure and City policies pertaining to pedestrian and
cyclist safety around Vancouver’s schools, any necessary infrastructure or policy
changes to ensure increased safety of children, staff and families, and proposed
budgets and timelines;
b. Engagement and consultation with the public, schools and Parent Advisory
Councils (PACs), the District Parent Advisory Council (DPAC), local and
Provincial Public Health authorities, and the City’s Transportation Advisory
Committee;
c. Specific standards that can be applied to all schools including for speed zone
reductions, traffic calming, pedestrian crossings, and cycling infrastructure;
d. Where recommendations for future work (particularly speed zones) could require
support from Legal staff or from the Vancouver Police Department, that should
be outlined in the report;
e. This report back happen within the 2019/2020 school year;
FURTHER THAT Council direct the Mayor to write a letter to the Provincial Ministers of
Education and Transportation informing them of Council’s goal of improving
transportation safety around schools, and request their support and participation.

3. Many people staying in the park state that it is safer than staying alone on the
street or in an alley;
4. Many people state that they prefer to stay in the park than in a shelter that is not
safe and is not able to meet the needs of campers with partners, pets or
belongings;
5. Most residents are living with makeshift shelters, lack of proper nutrition, no
storage facilities, and no formal source of heat;
6. There are many elderly and vulnerable residents already living with chronic
illnesses and ill-health;
7. The Overdose Prevention Site (OPS) at Oppenheimer Park operates 24 hours
per day and serves over 100 people per day without paid staff, proper supports
or electricity;
8. There is no proper sanitation at the park to support those who are employed or
seeking employment, and to promote good health of all residents;
9. The field house was closed this summer, but could provide a space for safe food
preparation and serving, storage of harm reduction and food preparation supplies
and equipment, electricity, and a resting place for OPS volunteers;
10. While most people agree that tent cities are not a good way to live, when there is
no housing or shelter available people can be safer in a tent city than being alone
on the street;
11. 2223 homeless people were counted in the last homeless count which is
recognized as an undercount, and over 600 of these people were unsheltered,
and all of them continue to need housing as soon as possible;
12. Social and modular housing will take years (social) and months (modular) to build
if there is funding for it, and people who are homeless deserve safety, warmth,
and sanitation now, especially with winter coming;
13. Oppenheimer Park is on unceded territory, and Grand Chief Stewart Phillip,

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, October 1, 2019 30
President of the Union of BC Indian Chiefs, says, "A disproportionately high
number of the vulnerable park residents facing the loss of a safe and stable living
situation are Indigenous. Any move to forcefully evict them is callous and
insensitive to the mental health, addictions, and poverty that they are battling as
a result of an ongoing colonial legacy of systemic discrimination and oppression.
The City of Vancouver stands to violate the basic rights of Indigenous peoples
articulated in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People,
as well as blatantly ignore the call for safe housing that is appropriate to the
cultural and economic needs of Indigenous peoples set out in the National
Inquiry’s Calls for Justice";
14. The UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Housing, Leilani Farha, says, "In
order for the City’s actions to be compliant with human rights, the residents of
Oppenheimer Park need to be meaningfully consulted and included in the
development of any plans related to their living situations. This includes working
with the residents so that together they can find ways to address issues around
fire safety, community clean-up, and violence”; and
15. In April, Council passed a motion to 'temporarily implement a warming station in
Oppenheimer Park or other city owned land within close proximity,' to 'provide
washroom facilities for park patrons including 24 hour access,' and to
'communicate about other possible solutions to help end and humanize
homelessness.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council acknowledge that homelessness in Vancouver is a humanitarian
crisis that requires immediate action above and beyond what has been done until
now.
B. THAT Council direct staff to work with partners and consult with Oppenheimer
Park residents about an accessible alternate site that ensures health and safety,
access to services and supports, and is acceptable and appropriate for people
currently living in Oppenheimer Park, including access to a community kitchen,
electricity, funding for peer support, storage facilities, 24-hour sanitation facilities
with running water, and a warming tent in Oppenheimer Park or other indoor site
near downtown eastside services.
C. THAT Council direct city officials to attend weekly resident led safety meetings
and that the City encourage representatives of other jurisdictions including VPD
staff and the Park Board to do this too.
D. THAT the City convene emergency homelessness task force meetings of elected
Federal, Provincial, City, Park Board members, and invite the Union of BC Indian
Chiefs and people who are homeless and their representatives, to make short
and longer term plans to ensure that all currently unsheltered people without
homes have a place to be safe and warm for the winter and to get proper
housing as soon as possible.

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, October 1, 2019 31
FURTHER THAT the work of the emergency homelessness task force includes:
i. Providing new housing options for Oppenheimer park residents and other
unsheltered people who are homeless, and/or buying or leasing one or
more hotels while ensuring appropriate housing for women and for
Indigenous women and children, until proper housing can be built;
ii. Securing land and government funding for modular homes, social and
co-op housing to drastically reduce homelessness in Vancouver.

5. Back to Basics: Prioritizing Public Realm Maintenance and Cleanliness in
Vancouver
MOVED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
SECONDED by Councillor Bligh
WHEREAS
1. The maintenance and cleanliness of roads, street medians, and sidewalks, as
well as the management of litter and litter receptacles in the public realm, are
among the core – most basic – jurisdictional responsibilities of local governments
such as the City of Vancouver;

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, October 1, 2019 32
2. Under the heading “Street and sidewalk cleaning and maintenance”, the City of
Vancouver website states that “Keeping our streets, sidewalks, and green
spaces safe and clean for everyone to enjoy is a City priority.”;
3. In recent years, the people who live and work in Vancouver, as well as visitors to
our city, have noted and openly commented on a significant decline in the
physical state and cleanliness of our city, offering up and reporting on numerous
examples such as streets with potholes, overgrown street medians, and
neglected sidewalks that represent a variety of safety hazards, and the increased
amount of litter on sidewalks, overflowing garbage cans, and discarded food
items that attract insects and other pests, all of which has resulted in the
diminishment of basic civic pride and confidence in the day-to-day management
of the City;
4. In July 2019, Vancouver City Council approved the 2020-2024 Budget Outlook,
signalling the start of the annual budget process that seeks to align available
funds with the priorities and service level expectations of the people who live and
work in Vancouver;
5. The City of Vancouver regularly refocuses its spending in response to changes in
service demands and priorities over time, and, when necessary and informed by
feedback from the public, public consultation and other valued sources, the City
makes new investments in emerging issues;
6. Residents and businesses in Vancouver are genuinely dismayed that while the
taxes and fees levied by the City of Vancouver constantly go up, services appear
to continually diminish, and that the city appears dirty and neglected from the
perspective of basic maintenance and commonly accepted standards of
cleanliness;
7. The majority of the funds to cover the cost of the annual City of Vancouver
budget – i.e. the money the City uses to run the city – come from property taxes
and utility fees collected from homeowners and businesses, as well as from
renters through the rent paid to landlords;
• NOTE: Under the City of Vancouver 2019 Operating Budget, a median
single-family home assessed at $1,832,000 paid an estimated $3,805 in
total City of Vancouver taxes and fees in 2019 while a median business
property assessed at $618,000 paid an estimated $5,512 in total City
taxes and fees (this amount does not include Provincial taxes and fees
collected by the City for the Province);
8. The people who live and work in Vancouver have a reasonable expectation that
the taxes and fees they pay to the City of Vancouver will be used to appropriately
maintain Vancouver’s roads, sidewalks and street medians, and to keep them in
a state of good repair and cleanliness, along with prompt attention to the removal
of litter and attending to public litter receptacles in a timely manner;
9. In 2017, Dillon Consulting Limited conducted a “Street Litter Audit” for the City of

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, October 1, 2019 33
Vancouver at 108 pre-selected locations in the city and observed that the most
common categories for large litter were cups (20%) and paper/fibre material
(19%) while the most common categories for small litter were cigarette
butts/debris (37%) and chewing gum (25%), with large litter items being equal to
or larger than 4 square inches and small litter items being smaller than 4 square
inches;
10. The City of Vancouver website prominently lists “Improved street cleaning,
including more litter and recycling receptacles” and “Cleaner parks with improved
litter pick-up” as being among the many benefits derived from the City’s annual
budgets – notably stating that the benefits from taxes and fees paid to the City
accrue “in your home, on your street, in your community, and throughout your
city”;
11. The Vancouver Board of Parks and Recreation plays a key role, and is a key
partner of the City of Vancouver, in keeping the city’s public realm clean and in a
good state of repair, notably the city’s traffic medians and shared spaces that the
Park Board maintains for the City of Vancouver under a contract service
arrangement;
12. Gaining physical access to street medians has become increasingly difficult for
the Park Board (e.g. Knight Street), as has access to the necessary financial
resources to achieve a proper standard of maintenance;
13. In 2017, the City of Vancouver implemented a new “Street Cleaning Utility fee”
with the stated purpose to reduce illegal dumping and create cleaner and safer
public realm spaces;
14. The City’s website states: “Garbage illegally dumped in a laneway – if not
cleaned up promptly – attracts more garbage. Abandoned garbage can also
cause health and environmental risks, sends a message that illegal activity is
tolerated in our neighbourhoods and costs taxpayers over a million dollars a
year.”;
15. The City’s stated commitment to “Keeping our streets, sidewalks, and green
spaces safe and clean for everyone to enjoy” as a City priority is best
demonstrated through action and a jurisdictionally appropriate emphasis and
prioritization of maintenance and cleanliness standards in conjunction with the
most prudent and effective use of taxpayer dollars.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Vancouver City Council direct staff to elevate the priority given to the
maintenance of the City’s roads, street medians, and sidewalks, and that this be
a key guiding element in the preparation of the City’s 2020 Budget, with an aim to
improve the state of good repair and safety and cleanliness of these assets,
including direction to staff to take immediate steps to elevate the priority given to
sidewalk repair and street litter removal and public litter receptacles in
accordance with the reasonable expectations of the people who live and work in

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, October 1, 2019 34
Vancouver for the public realm to be well maintained, safe and clean;
FURTHER THAT Council direct staff to bring forward as part of the 2020 Budget
process the expenditures required to achieve the maintenance and cleanliness
objectives noted above, including a proposed reallocation of funds from other
City of Vancouver budget items of lesser public impact and effectiveness (noting
that such reallocation of funds need not be restricted to the streets and sanitation
portion of the City’s Budget), that would not add to the total tax load imposed on
the City’s taxpayers through taxes and fees that are yet to be levied in the City’s
2020 Budget.
B. THAT Council direct staff to report back prior to the presentation of the 2020
Proposed Budget with an update on any and all impediments that may exist for
the Park Board as it relates to its ability to fulfill the contracted maintenance of
the city’s street medians, including recommendations for how these impediments
can be overcome in a timely and cost-effective manner.
C. THAT Council direct staff to report back prior to the presentation of the 2020
Proposed Budget on the “Street Cleaning Utility fee” implemented in 2017, a fee
that sought to reduce illegal dumping and create cleaner and safer public realm
spaces, including information on how the funds have been applied, results
achieved, and an identification of areas where additional support is required to
achieve the desired results, such that the level of safety and cleanliness in the
public realm is fully consistent with the reasonable expectations of those who live
and work and pay taxes and fees in Vancouver.
D. THAT Council signal its ongoing commitment to the timely and sufficient
maintenance and cleanliness of the city’s roads, sidewalks and street medians to
keep them in a state of safety and good repair, as well as the effective and
prompt management of street litter and litter receptacles in the public realm, by
directing staff to include language in the City’s proposed 2020 Operating Budget
that keeping our streets, sidewalks, and public spaces safe and clean for
everyone to enjoy is a Council priority and among the core jurisdictional
responsibilities of the City of Vancouver.

CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, October 1, 2019 35
6. Establishing an Independent Auditor General Office for the City of Vancouver
MOVED by Councillor Hardwick
SECONDED by Councillor Bligh
WHEREAS
1. Good governance in the municipal sector, and ensuring that a municipal
government achieves its intended results while always acting in the public
interest, is essential to satisfying the public’s expectation that a municipality is
providing effective stewardship over public assets, value-for-money in
operations, transparent administration, and accountability for results;
2. Ensuring that the City of Vancouver is financially healthy and administratively
effective, including a commitment to service excellence, are chief among the
governance goals of the City – as articulated prominently in the City’s 2019
Corporate Plan;
3. The City of Vancouver’s organizational structure serves to support the
community through various departments, services, and groups, including
departments, services, and groups responsible for Finance, Risk, and Business
Planning functions;
4. Each year, the City of Vancouver prepares a combined annual budget and five-
year financial plan, made up of operating and capital budgets and department
service plans, with approximately three quarters of the annual funds required to
run the City coming directly from property taxes and utility fees;
5. Section 230 (1) of the Vancouver Charter requires that Council shall, “not later
than the first Council meeting in each year, appoint a firm of chartered
professional accountants to audit the accounts and transactions of the city and of
every other administrative body.” i
6. There are three types of municipal audit functions: Auditors General, external
City Auditors, and Internal Auditors, each of which plays a different but
interdependent role, and all of which can add significant value to a municipality
despite the fact that the differences between them are not always well
understood by members of a City Council or Audit Committee;
7. The City of Vancouver is the only major Canadian city that does not have an
Auditor General’s office (or a comparable “City Auditor” office) that is
independent of the City’s management – one that is capable of providing an
essential layer of independent financial and performance oversight of the City’s
financial and operational affairs;
8. The City of Vancouver currently has an internal audit process and internal audit
division that “reports to the internal audit management team consisting of the city
manager, deputy city manager, director of finance, and director of legal services,”

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, October 1, 2019 36
9. The City’s Internal Audit (IA) Division consists of “a team of five certified internal
audit professionals” dedicated to completing a variety of audits focused on
“effectiveness, efficiency, and economy” to provide “an independent and
objective assurance function which helps promote the City's efficiency,
effectiveness, and accountability.”; ii
10. In contrast to the City of Vancouver’s existing internal audit processes, Auditors
General at the municipal level report directly to a City Council, or a Committee of
Council, and have a mandate to set their own audit plan, publicly report the
results of audits, serve independently from City management, and greatly assist
Councils in holding themselves and City administrators accountable for the
stewardship of public funds and the achievement of value-for-money within
municipal operations;
11. The establishment of an Auditor General Office in the City of Vancouver,
consistent with Auditor General offices in other major Canadian cities, and
operating independent of the City’s internal audit processes, would offer an
enhanced standard of audit independence and objectivity and help to ensure that
the City is providing effective stewardship over public assets, value-for-money in
operations, transparent administration, and accountability for results, consistent
with the public’s reasonable expectations; iii
12. In July 2011, prior to the Province of British Columbia establishing the Auditor
General for Local Government (AGLG) office (NOTE: BC’s AGLG currently has
an annual budget of $2.6 million and serves 190 local governments ranging in
size from 250 to over 500,000 people), the Union of British Columbia
Municipalities (UBCM) issued a Context Paper entitled, “Municipal Auditor
General Context Paper: Background and context to the proposed Office of the
Municipal Auditor General under consideration by the Province of British
Columbia,” with the intention to: iv
• Inform discussions of local government Councils and Boards as they
considered responses to a survey on the proposed BC Municipal Auditor
General from the Minister of Community, Sport and Cultural
Development.
• Present UBCM’s initial research relating to a) Auditors General and
Municipal Auditors General across Canada, b) the local government
financial accountability framework in British Columbia, and c)
considerations relating to further policy development work.
• Assist UBCM members as they prepared for a broader public discussion
of the initiative within their communities;
13. UBCM’s 2011 Context Paper variously notes the existence of Municipal Auditors
General in Nova Scotia, Quebec (for municipalities over 100,000 population), in
Ontario (with a specific requirement for the City of Toronto), and Manitoba, as
well as “generalized statutory powers in Alberta and BC” that allow a local

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, October 1, 2019 37
government to establish a Municipal Auditor General and “assign duties to the
Office.”; v
14. Examples of Canadian municipalities that have Municipal Auditors General
independent of a city’s management and administrators (or alternatively a “City
Auditor” with much the same function, mandate, and reporting structure as an
Auditor General) include the following: vi
• Sudbury, Ontario: “The Auditor General reports directly to Greater
Sudbury Council and is responsible for assisting Council in holding itself
and its administrators accountable for the quality of stewardship over
public funds and for achievement of value for money in municipal
operations. By performing duties in an independent manner, and making
reports available to the public, the Auditor General’s Office plays an
important role in promoting transparency, accountability and trust in
municipal operations.”;
• Edmonton, Alberta: “The City Auditor is appointed by City Council to
provide internal audit services. The delegated powers, duties, and
functions of this position are established under the City Auditor Bylaw. In
providing services to the corporation, the Office of the City Auditor
performs the key roles of guardian and agent of change.” (City of
Edmonton City Auditor By-law 12424);
• Montréal, Québec: (Bureau du vérificateur general) “The Auditor General
assists City Council in the execution of its governance duties by keeping
it updated on the diligent and optimal use of public funds by Municipal
Administration. By means of fully independent audits and the publication
of reports which are available to the public, the Auditor General plays a
critical role in promoting the transparency and accountability of municipal
operations.”;
NOTE: Report of The Auditor General of The Ville De Montréal for
o
the year ended December 31, 2018 – Our mission is to “provide
city council and citizens with an objective and independent view of
the quality of public funds management, including the economic,
efficient and effective use of resources, legal and regulatory
compliance, and the reliability of financial statements.”
• Halifax, Nova Scotia: “The Auditor General is responsible for assisting
Council in holding itself and the Municipality’s administrators accountable
for the quality of stewardship over the public funds and for achievement
of value for money in the Municipality’s operations.”;
• Winnipeg, Manitoba: “The City Auditor is a statutory officer appointed by
City Council under The City of Winnipeg Charter and is independent of
the Public Service. Powers and authorities granted through the City of
Winnipeg Charter, By-laws and Council motions support the position and
mandate of the City Auditor…. The City Auditor conducts examinations

of the operations of the City and its affiliated bodies to assist Council in
its governance role of ensuring the accountability of the Public Service
for the quality of stewardship over public funds and for the achievement
of value for money in City operations. The City Auditor is directly
accountable to City Council through the Audit Committee which is
comprised of Executive Policy Committee members.”;
NOTE: Mission – “To support City Council and the Public Service
o
by providing objective and independent advice and assurance with
respect to governance, risk management, performance and
accountability.”;
• Calgary, Alberta: “The City Auditor’s Office is responsible for assisting
Council in its oversight of the City Manager’s Administration,
accountability for stewardship over public funds, and accountability for
the achievement of value for money in City operations. The City Auditor
is a designated officer appointed by Council and is independent of The
City’s Administration. The City Auditor reports to Council through the
Audit Committee. The City Auditor’s duties, responsibilities and authority
are established by Bylaw 30M2004.”;
• Toronto, Ontario: “The Auditor General is responsible for assisting City
Council in holding itself and City administrators accountable for the
quality of stewardship over public funds and for achievement of value for
money in City operations. The Auditor General’s Office is independent of
management and has the authority to conduct financial, operational,
compliance, information systems, forensic and other special reviews” of
most City departments, City agencies and corporations, local boards
provided for under the City of Toronto Act, and other entities the City is
related to or has an interest in;
15. UBCM’s 2011 Context Paper states that “While there is no specific authority for a
BC local government to appoint a MAG [Municipal Auditor General], the audit
provisions relating to both municipalities and regional districts allow Councils and
Boards to require reports (in addition to the required financial statement reports)
from their auditors. This would allow Councils/Boards to require such things as
performance audits. In addition, the natural persons powers’ of municipalities and
broad corporate powers of regional districts should be sufficient for
Councils/Boards to establish an Office of the MAG and assign duties to that
Office, if they so choose.”; vii
16. Section 162 of the Vancouver Charter states that “The Council (a) may establish
and equip such departments and offices as it may from time to time deem
expedient in the exercise of its powers, and may assign such functions and
duties to the persons employed in such departments and offices as the Council
may from time to time decide.”; viii

capital budgets, which have a combined total that now approaches $2 billion

annually, along with many competing budget priorities, necessitates that
Vancouver City Council explore and seriously consider governance best
practices observed in other major Canadian cities, such as an Independent
Auditor General, that can serve to strengthen the City of Vancouver’s audit
functions and inspire public confidence that the City of Vancouver and Vancouver
City Council are providing the best possible stewardship over public funds while
actively and continuously seeking to better identify and mitigate risks the City
faces, improve accountability, strengthen management controls, and enhance
the efficiency and effectiveness of City operations;
18. The City of Vancouver (see: Internal audit reports: https://vancouver.ca/your-
government/internal-audit-reports.aspx) subscribes to the notion that “An
independent audit function is essential to government accountability.” ix
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Vancouver City Council establish an Independent Auditor General Office
for the City of Vancouver, one that would report directly to Council independent
of the City’s management and internal audit functions, to assist City Council in
holding itself and City administrators accountable, and for this office to be based
on the best practices, insights, and experience observed in other major Canadian
cities that have municipal Auditors General, the intention of which will be to
further strengthen the City’s audit and financial functions and inspire public
confidence and faith among taxpayers that the City of Vancouver and Vancouver
City Council are providing the best possible stewardship over public funds while
actively and continuously seeking to:
• better identify and mitigate risks the City faces,
• improve accountability,
• strengthen management controls, and
• enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of City operations;
FURTHER THAT a target date of March 1, 2020, be set for the appointment of
an Independent Auditor General, with an initial office budget of $1 million
annually, and with the funds to be integral to the City’s 2020 Operating Budget
and recouped from savings and efficiencies identified by the Auditor General in
subsequent City of Vancouver Budget years.
B. THAT a committee of Council be formed, comprised of all eleven elected
members of Council, and consistent with Section 161 of the Vancouver Charter, x
to direct the establishment and implementation of an Independent Auditor
General Office for the City of Vancouver, including directing the search for and
appointment of an Auditor General, in consultation with, and based upon
recommendations from such bodies as the Canadian Audit and Accountability
Foundation (CAAF) as well as other relevant authorities that Council may deem
appropriate (e.g., consultation with BC’s Auditor General for Local Government,
offices of Auditors General across Canada), with a target date of no later than
January 1, 2020, for the committee of Council to have met to review initial

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, October 1, 2019 40
recommendations for the implementation of an Auditor General office and
appointment of an Auditor General.
C. THAT Vancouver City Council direct staff to obtain three independent outside
legal opinions, as well as advice from appropriate provincial ministries and
advisory bodies such as the Union of British Columbia Municipalities etc.,
regarding the existing legislative provisions (such as those in the Vancouver
Charter and any specified provisions of the Community Charter and the Local
Government Act that apply to Vancouver), under which an Independent Auditor
General office could operate without further enabling legislation, and for staff to
report back to Council on this specific question by December 1, 2019.
D. THAT Vancouver City Council request that the City’s Internal Audit (IA) Division,
which reports to the internal audit management team consisting of the city
manager, deputy city manager, director of finance, and director of legal services,
make a presentation to Council before the end of October 2019 with an overview
of the findings and recommendations of the City’s Internal Audit (IA) Division over
the past six years, with specific reference to performance / operational, financial
and compliance audits of various programs and business processes, and related
recommendations to City departments, including those specific to the
effectiveness of internal controls and efficiency of business processes.
E. THAT Vancouver City Council direct and/or otherwise empower the Mayor, on
behalf of Vancouver City Council and the City of Vancouver, to write to the
Premier of British Columbia with a formal request to the Provincial government,
should that prove to be necessary upon due consideration and evaluation of any
and all independent legal and advisory recommendations regarding existing
legislative frameworks surrounding the establishment of an Independent Auditor
General Office in the City of Vancouver, to initiate any legislative process or
processes provincially that may be required to provide for, but not be limited to,
any specific legal protections or powers that a City of Vancouver Auditor General
may require for the effective operation of an Independent Auditor General office
that may not otherwise be provided for in the Vancouver Charter or other existing
legislation, such as questions relating to:
• protection from legal liability related to the contents of an audit report (when
acting in good faith) ;
• the power to compel documents or examine a person under oath;
• provisions to ensure that privileged solicitor-client information disclosed to an
Auditor-General is not a waiver of privilege appropriate protection from
disclosure under freedom of information legislation.

i The external Auditors appointed by Vancouver City Council are responsible for auditing the
City’s Financial Statements, the purpose of which is “to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due
to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report.” (2018 Annual Financial Report).

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, October 1, 2019 41
The City’s Management is “responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the [City’s]
financial statements in accordance with Canadian public sector accounting standards
organizations, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable
the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to
fraud or error.” (2018 Annual Financial Report).
As noted by the City’s external Auditors in the City’s most recent Annual Financial Report
(2018): “Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit
conducted in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing standards will always
detect a material misstatement when it exists” and further that “Misstatements can arise from
fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could
reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the
financial statements.”
ii The City of Vancouver Internal Audit (IA) Division is a member of the Canadian Audit and
Accountability Foundation (CAAF) as well as the Association of Local Government Auditors
(ALGA), the Municipal Internal Auditors Association (MIAA), and the Institute of Internal Auditors
(IIA).
iii As part of the UBCM process in 2011, the Executive (2011) respectfully asked the Minister for
clarity and “to identify the problem [a provincial] MAG was intended to resolve, how [a provincial]
MAG fits into the overall local government accountability system, what gaps there were in that
system, if any, and whether any consideration had been given to strengthening existing
mechanisms as an alternative to developing a new Office of the MAG if there were gaps.”
The UBCM Executive (2011) suggested to the Minister that MAG “policy development could
benefit from a broader perspective, and consideration of additional principles,” such as:
 Respect for local government policy choices
 Respect for jurisdiction
 Build on existing systems, and
 Maximize public accountability benefits while respecting local autonomy and recognizing
local capacity.
iv Specifically, UBCM’s 2011 Context Paper notes the following:
 “Nova Scotia legislation requires a MAG for all municipalities, although only the
legislation specific to Halifax has been implemented. Discussions are ongoing between
the Union of Nova Scotia Municipalities and the Province about how best to implement
the 2008 legislation for all other municipalities.”
 “The only other MAG requirements in Canada are for municipalities with populations
greater than 100,000 in Quebec, and for the City of Toronto.”
 “… Ontario municipalities and the City of Winnipeg are specifically empowered to
appoint a MAG, but are not required to do so (examples of those that have are Ottawa
and Oshawa).”

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, October 1, 2019 42
 “More generalized legislative authority allows Alberta and BC local governments to
appoint a MAG, and this power has been used by Edmonton and Calgary.”
v UBCM’s 2011 scan did not indicate a specific requirement for a Municipal Auditor General, or
specific municipal empowerment to appoint a MAG, for local governments in the provinces of
Saskatchewan, Manitoba (except Winnipeg), Quebec (under 100,000), New Brunswick, Prince
Edward Island, and Newfoundland, UBCM expressed the opinion that these jurisdictions “may
have sufficient generalized powers to appoint a MAG, under the same types of authorities as

vi In 2012, the Government of British Columbia established an Auditor General for Local
Government (AGLG) office by means of the Auditor General for Local Government Act.
The role of British Columbia’s Auditor General for Local Government is advisory, not
supervisory, and as such the office does not comment on the policy decisions or objectives of
locally elected officials, impose requirements, or duplicate existing financial accountability
mechanisms;.
British Columbia’s Auditor General for Local Government Act states that the specific purpose of
the Auditor General for Local Government is “to conduct performance audits of the operations of
local governments in order to provide local governments with objective information and relevant
advice that will assist them in their accountability to their communities for the stewardship of
public assets and the achievement of value for money in their operations.”
Performance audits, as performed by the office of the Auditor General for Local Government,
largely serve to identify “value-for-money” best practices that can be highlighted for the benefit
of all local governments in the province and are not the same as traditional financial audits.
British Columbia’s Office of the Auditor General for Local Government has an annual budget of
just $2.6 million and serves 190 local governments ranging in size from 250 to over 500,000
people, with 10 municipalities having populations greater than 100,000 people.
The Annual Report of the Auditor General for Local Government, covering the period April 1,
2018 through March 31, 2019, indicates that there were five audit-related reports released
during 2018/19 (i.e., two performance audits, three AGLG perspectives booklets, and the
substantial completion of one other complex audit on drinking water).

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, October 1, 2019 43
British Columbia’s Auditor General for Local Government, Gordon Ruth, has publicly stated that
his office does not have the resources to conduct more than a few selected performance audits
each year.
vii UBCM’s research in 2011 noted that, as with provincial Auditors General who are appointed
by the elected body representing the government entity being audited, “and report to that body,”
most Municipal Auditors General in Canada have this same appointment and reporting structure
(i.e. they are appointed by, and report to, the municipal Council), with the one exception being
Nova Scotia (in 2011) where implementation had not yet taken place and where Municipal
Auditors General were to be appointed by the Minister and report to the Council(s) being
audited, with a copy of all reports to the Minister.
viii Section 180 (4) of the Vancouver Charter (Indemnification of employees) states that “The
council may by by-law provide that the city will, to the extent therein set out, indemnify its
officers and employees, members of its council or any public service organization against a
claim for damages against an officer or employee, members of its council or public service
organizations or any of them arising out of the performance of his or its duties and, in addition,
pay legal costs incurred in a court proceeding arising out of the claim.”
ix The City of Vancouver is a member of the Canadian Audit and Accountability Foundation and
thereby subscribes to the Foundation’s inherent belief “that accountability is best served by
auditors with the knowledge and skills to produce reports that make an impact, oversight bodies
able to effectively discharge their responsibilities, and managers who can implement audit
recommendations to improve their organization’s performance.”
The Canadian Audit and Accountability Foundation is a not-for-profit organization dedicated to
promoting and strengthening public sector performance audit, oversight, and accountability in
Canada and abroad through research, education, and knowledge sharing.
The Canadian Audit and Accountability Foundation has worked since 1980, with the support of
its members and stakeholders, to assist all parties to the accountability relationship (i.e.,
oversight bodies, management, and the auditors who serve the accountability relationship) to
improve the performance and accountability of public bodies, with resources, tools, and training
to carry out their respective responsibilities, and by providing a national focal point for
knowledge sharing and networking that fosters Canada-wide collaboration and discussion on
issues of mutual interest;
x Section 161 of the Vancouver Charter requires a 2/3 vote of all members of Council in order to
delegate any executive or administrative powers exercisable by Council to a committee
comprised of members of Council.

7. Expediting an Elementary School for the Olympic Village Community – the City’s
Role
MOVED by Councillor Dominato
SECONDED by Councillor Boyle
WHEREAS
1. The City of Vancouver, together with the Vancouver School Board (VSB), has
long planned for a school to be built in the Olympic Village, to support the
objectives of creating a diverse, vibrant community where individuals, families,
and children can live and thrive;
2. The City of Vancouver’s Official Development Plan (ODP) for South East False
Creek anticipated that an elementary school for the Olympic Village would be
built in concert with other core amenities and, as one of several stated goals for
the project, be in place by 2020;
3. Schedule A of the Southeast False Creek Official Development Plan (April 2007)
includes numerous references to an elementary school, including:
• Section 4.3.5 (Cultural, recreational, and institutional uses) states:
“Development is to include the following facilities: (a) one K-7 community
elementary school having a floor area of at least 3 700 m2 , and
including a gymnasium in area 2A;”
• Section 4.4 (Phasing of parks and community facilities) states: “Phasing
decisions for the parks, community centre and non-motorized boating
centre, and other community facilities are to happen at the time of the
applicable CD-1 re-zonings; and are to include every effort to co-
ordinate delivery of the elementary school in a time frame compatible
with the delivery of such other facilities.”;
• Section 5.4.2 (Area 2A – The central “shipyard” neighbourhood) states:
“… A cluster of community services via Front Street and the seaside
greenway/bikeway are to connect to the community heart. Such services

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, October 1, 2019 45
are to include a community centre combined with a non-motorized
recreational boating facility and day care facility to animate the waterfront
and an elementary school, which may include more child care and
after-school care, located within easy walking distance of the
community centre and boating facility and beside the park that is to
be large enough for a playfield. The waterfront park near the school is
to provide a community demonstration garden including garden plots and
sustainability education lessons for children and adults.”
4. The development of the Southeast False Creek community was intended to be “a
leading model of sustainable development” – a “complete neighbourhood” with
goods and services within walking distance, and housing and jobs that are
accessible by transit;
5. Southeast False Creek was designed as a mixed-use community, with a total
population of 11,000 – 13,000 people, with a focus on residential housing;
6. The reasonable expectation that an elementary school would be in place for the
Olympic Village community by 2020, as noted in the South East False Creek
ODP, led many to choose the Olympic Village as a neighbourhood where they
could build their lives and livelihoods and start families;
7. To date, an elementary school for the Olympic Village community has received
neither approval nor funding from the provincial Ministry of Education;
8. The existing catchment school for the Olympic Village neighbourhood – Simon
Fraser Elementary – is significantly overcapacity and receives nearly three times
the in-catchment applications for kindergarten than it can handle;
9. The overcapacity conditions at Simon Fraser Elementary are forcing families to
send students to schools well outside their neighbourhood, with students
attending more than two dozen different schools throughout the city,
exacerbating traffic congestion and air pollution in a city that strives to be the
greenest city in the world while seriously undermining the human connections
between students, friends, and neighbours that are the foundation of a healthy,
thriving community;
10. Many other Olympic Village families are simply giving up on the prospect of a
neighbourhood school being built in time for their children to attend and are
therefore moving from the community to more established areas where there are
existing schools – a loss to the Olympic Village community and to these young
families alike;
11. In June 2018, Education Minister Rob Fleming stated that he wants to see the
Vancouver school district build schools more quickly and noted that it takes
longer to build schools in Vancouver – five years – than in other districts, such as
Surrey, where it takes about three years;

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, October 1, 2019 46
12. In May 2018, the VSB considered a motion, brought forward by Trustee Lisa
Dominato, calling on the City of Vancouver to fast-track development and
building permits for Vancouver schools (new schools, replacements, additions,
and renovations) by means of a “Nexus” style fast-track approval process – the
motion failed narrowly in a tie vote;
13. There is currently no City of Vancouver policy that prioritizes applications for
building and development permits for the Vancouver school district. The school
district’s applications are processed alongside permit applications for all city
developments including commercial, single family dwellings, laneways,
condominium developments, housing projects, and community centres;
14. In May 2018, it reportedly took – on average – 12 months for the school district to
receive a development permit and 8 months to receive a building permit for new
and replacement schools, which added more than one year to school capital
projects;
15. Last year, the VSB entered into an agreement with BC Hydro whereby a
subsurface parcel at the Lord Roberts Annex site was sold to accommodate a
much needed electrical substation in the West End / Downtown core;
16. A portion of the VSB proceeds from the Lord Roberts Annex site subsurface sale
agreement with BC Hydro will go toward the capital cost of a new school in Coal
Harbour, which means the Province has saved money on a capital expenditure
and could re-allocate that funding to build an Olympic Village Elementary school;
17. In Year One of the VSB 2020/21 Capital Plan, the school district is seeking
Ministry of Education approval for the acquisition of a school site for a South East
False Creek / Olympic Village Elementary school;
18. It is crucially important that funding for an elementary school in Olympic Village
be secured and made available as soon as possible to get the school project
underway, and the City of Vancouver has various tools and potential options
available within its jurisdictional domain to do its part and to help accomplish this
longstanding goal for the South East False Creek community.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to create a “fast-track” process, on an urgent basis,
whereby the approval of development and building permits for Vancouver
schools (new schools, replacements, additions, and renovations) can be
expedited to ensure that Vancouver school facilities can be built, replaced, added
to, and/or renovated in a timely manner, to help build strong, diverse, sustainable
neighbourhoods and communities in our city, with staff to report back to Council
by January 2020 regarding actions taken in this regard.
B. THAT Council direct staff to work with the Vancouver School Board staff to
explore ways to work together on a collective basis to improve and streamline
various City approval processes in pursuit of the timely construction,

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, October 1, 2019 47
replacement, and/or renovation to Vancouver Schools, including an elementary
school in Southeast False Creek / Olympic Village.
C. THAT Council call on the Province to prioritize capital funds for a new school in
South East False Creek / Olympic Village, on an urgent basis, acknowledging the
pressing need for a school in this area, as well as the fact that the Vancouver
School Board (VSB) is fully funding the new Coal Harbour school through
proceeds from the Lord Roberts Annex site subsurface sale by the VSB to BC
Hydro which relieves the Province of this related capital expense.
D. THAT Council acknowledge its role and responsibility to ensure that there is
adequate and appropriate space for the learning needs of our city’s youngest
residents, and that Council direct staff to explore the possibility of:
i. Leasing the city-owned land in Southeast False Creek/ Olympic
Village, on an urgent basis, to the Vancouver School Board for a
nominal sum as a means to expedite construction of a long-
anticipated elementary school in lieu of a direct acquisition
through a sale or land transfer;
ii. Enabling the construction of a “modular school” if a lack
provincial funding or other delays fail to address the school
facility needs of the Southeast False Creek / Olympic Village
neighbourhood in a timely manner.
E. THAT a copy of this motion to be sent to the Trustees and Senior Staff of the
Vancouver School Board.

8. Increasing Affordable Housing Options Through Character House Incentives in RS
Zones
MOVED by Councillor Hardwick
SECONDED by Councillor De Genova
WHEREAS
1. Demolition of existing RS character housing in Vancouver is a major contributor
to our city’s affordable housing crisis, whereby properties are redeveloped and
liveable homes replaced with significantly more expensive homes typically built
for a luxury market, the frequent result of which is the elimination of affordable
secondary suites and the displacement of renters;
2. Destroying enduring Vancouver homes built with quality natural materials, and
replacing them with much larger single family homes made with synthetic
materials, and an inherently shorter life-span, is not sustainable and inconsistent
with the City’s Green objectives and the City’s local efforts to prevent and
otherwise mitigate the impacts of a global climate crisis;
3. In relation to Greenhouse Gas Emission (GHG) reduction objectives, a 2018
study by UBC Architecture Professor Joseph Dahmen concludes the following:
“... it can take years before the embodied greenhouse gas emissions associated
with new construction are offset by more efficient operations…. The average
carbon dioxide emission payback period of 168 years for a typical high efficiency
new home renders it unlikely that emission savings will be realized before it is
replaced….”;
4. Making retention tools available adds definition and vibrancy to neighbourhoods,
improves housing choices and affordability, and accommodates growth while
retaining neighbourhood character – for example, conditional zones such as RT-
7 and RT-8 in Kitsilano have led to some of our city’s most vibrant, family-friendly
neighbourhoods, while providing equitable treatment of character retention
stream in relation to various non-character building streams, and has resulted in
few demolitions;
5. The City of Vancouver undertook a multi-year Character House Zoning Review,
with extensive public consultation, in order to curb the large number of character
and heritage house demolitions that take place every year in the city;
6. Many of the publically supported options identified in the City’s multi-year
Character House Zoning Review have not been implemented and the demolition
of sustainably-built, enduring housing stock continues virtually unabated – for
example:
● Despite a full 75% support city-wide for “increased flexibility in zoning to
support Character Home retention” demonstrated through the Character
House Zoning Review, the City chose – under the previous Council – to
not implement conditional zoning changes along the lines of those that

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, October 1, 2019 49
have worked successfully to retain character houses in Kitsilano and
served to create vibrant, family-friendly neighbourhoods;
● Despite 70% support city-wide for allowing multiple secondary suites in
character homes, but allowing two secondary suites – as recommended –
was not implemented by the previous Council;
● Despite 76% support city-wide in the Character House Zoning Review for
“design guidelines to clarify requirements and support renovations,”
design guidelines were not implemented by the previous Council leading
to poor design and lower quality materials such as faux rock or tile
facades which continue to undermine neighbourhood character;
7. There are 60,000 RS-zoned lots across the city that can help to address the
city’s housing crisis and support the City’s climate change objectives through
character house retention options and adaptive reuse of character homes;
8. Enabling character house retention options can enable the creation of a great
number and range of affordable housing units spread across the city’s 60,000
RS-zoned lots while also accommodating growth in ways that are consistent with
the City’s many stated goals and objectives, including the City’s stated Greenest
City goals related to waste reduction, and would not preclude further changes
that may come later under the City-wide Plan;
9. The City’s current Secondary Suite Program already allows relaxations to the
Building By-laws and Zoning and Development By-laws, such as waiving
sprinkler requirements, allowing lower ceiling heights, requiring only one exit,
removal of interior stairs, etc., for one secondary suite;
10. Many houses in the city have been converted to have two secondary suites, with
three rental suites in total (i.e., top floor, main floor, and basement), although one
of these units is usually unauthorized unless changes can be made to allow all
three units through the Secondary Suite Program, and subject to the Building By-
law to make them legal and safe, for affordable rentals and owners’ mortgage
helpers;
11. If character and heritage houses are to be meaningfully retained and adaptively
reused as intended by the Character House Zoning Review, further changes are
required to the City’s RS zoning, the Vancouver Building By-laws, the Secondary
Suite Program, and other by-laws and policies;
12. Although some previous changes have been made by the City, the City’s
Building By laws and how they are applied continue to make renovation of
character and heritage houses difficult to implement, and current RS zoned
character house incentives have clearly not prevented demolitions (NOTE: a
recent staff update shows 235 character houses have been demolished in 2018
while only 27 have been retained through character house incentives);
13. The new duplex zoning approved by the city in October 2018, which allows for
four units including secondary or lock-off suites, has only served to place
increased development pressure on character houses and neighbourhoods and

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, October 1, 2019 50
made the situation worse;
14. The Character House Zoning Review included years of consultation, and if
zoning changes are delayed, an increasing amount of our city’s heritage and
character house stock will be lost along with the affordable housing opportunities
they represent.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to provide a report for Council by December 10, 2019,
to consider implementing the following changes as a priority in Q1 to all RS
Zones city wide, including the required staff resources, preferably from
reassignment and/or additional resources as may be required in the 2020
budget:
a. To add conditional zoning mechanisms (similar to Kitsilano RT-7 & RT-8
zones) with a low outright floor space ratio of 0.50 floor space ratio “FSR”
in all RS zones, (except for RS 3 & RS-3A that would have an equivalent
but different low outright calculation method) where further increases in
density, and development for a laneway house, secondary suite or
duplex, are earned through two approval streams: one stream for
incentives for character house retention and the other stream for non-
character house lots;
b. To increase options beyond current incentives to retain character houses,
(including 0.75 FSR + 0.16 Laneway House; 0.75 FSR Multiple
Conversion Dwelling, “MCD”; 0.85 FSR with Infill; 0.85 FSR MCD with
Infill) add the following:
allowing two secondary suites (for rental only, not for strata MCD)
in the main house, with conversion under the Secondary Suite
Program to ensure acceptable safety and liveability standards,
and any related changes to the Secondary Suite Program and
Vancouver Building By law that may be required to allow this;
c. For non-character house lots to earn density above outright 0.50 FSR for
a single family house with basement suite, to the full conditional 0.70 FSR
(with development options as per current zoning) the following would
have to be achieved:
design guidelines followed; and
at least a secondary suite is provided, or on lots with over 49 ft.
frontage, a duplex is provided in the main dwelling when the
existing house is demolished (except RS-3 & RS-3A where
duplexes are not currently allowed). However, consider allowing
an option for the duplex to have an internal connection if one
owner has both units or the owners agree in writing, that could be
easily closed off as would be required if the units are to be

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, October 1, 2019 51
separated for strata for future downsizing or for the next owner;
and
d. Provide design guidelines for both character house retention and non-
character house lots to ensure quality of design and materials, and
appropriate fit into neighbourhood character streetscape.
B. THAT Council direct staff to bring forward a report for Council to consider for
changes to the 2019 Vancouver Building By-law to allow more flexibility and
exemptions for character house and heritage retention options, and better
process including the following:
a. Expand the Alternate Requirements under Section 11 to provide
acceptable solutions that allow flexibility where a character house or
heritage building was built under other building code requirements of its
era and allow current building codes to provide alternatives, while
addressing life safety issues, as may be approved by the Chief Building
Official from time to time. Provide clear explanatory guidelines to the
public. Some examples include:
i. Explore alternative options to fire sprinkler requirements, while
addressing life safety issues, for a character house (with up to one
secondary suite) when only minor renovations are proposed, and
when a strata infill is added in rear yard, limit sprinklers on the
main existing house, that is not being substantially renovated, to
only apply to protect the side yard means of egress;
ii. Explore alternative options for laneway house sewer services for
an existing character house, allowing discretion to the Director of
Planning and Chief Building Official in order to retain mature trees
since retaining mature trees and landscape on private property is
also a City priority and any related amendments to the Sewer By-
law 8093;
iii. Explore alternative options to prevent a basement in a character
house from being counted as a storey under the Fire Code when
the main floor is more than 6 ft. above grade, which many
character houses are, especially if it is raised to create a liveable
basement. If the basement is counted as a storey, it would make a
typical 2 ½ storey house counted as 4 storeys and then the Part 3
of the Vancouver Building By-law (for multifamily construction)
would apply. This should be avoided;
b. Allow two secondary suites to be converted through the Secondary Suite
Program as an incentive for character house retention only, and related
amendments to the Secondary Suite Program as required; and
c. Provide the recently established Renovation Centre with specialized staff,
processes and resources, to be included in the 2020 budget, to improve

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, October 1, 2019 52
the approval of renovations and character/heritage retention incentive
programs;
C. THAT Council direct:
a. Staff to report back by Q1 2020 on potential tax incentives for retention
options in RS zones for heritage houses listed on the City of Vancouver
heritage register such as for property tax waivers as part of a Heritage
Revitalization Agreement (HRA), as are now allowed in other areas of the
city, and/or request the province to waive the Additional School Tax, or
other potential options;
b. Staff to bring forward a policy report by Q1 2020, for Council
consideration of approval for local heritage density transfers as part of a
Heritage Revitalization Agreement (HRA) for exceptional heritage listed
"A" properties in RS zones that are vulnerable to demolition (but where
part or all of the increased density could not be accommodated onsite
without ruining the heritage values), with the density transfer to be landed
within the same neighbourhood in a community supported scale and
location, but not for addition to the Density Bank; and
c. Staff to report back on rates of demolitions in one year after zoning and
building by-law changes are implemented as per above, if Council enacts
the changes.

MOVED by Councillor Wiebe
SECONDED by Councillor Dominato
WHEREAS
1 Vancouver is experiencing unprecedented housing and mental health and
addiction issues;
2. In recent years, we have seen regular annual encampments in parks and sites
across the city, including Oppenheimer Park;
3. There are a significant number of persons currently living on the city’s streets, or
out of their cars, due to the shortage of appropriately affordable housing who
simply require access to shower and washroom facilities to support them on their
path to permanent housing and employment;
4. All levels of government need to work together to address the systemic factors
that prevent people from accessing safe, secure housing and basic health care,
along with appropriate mental health and addiction services.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to develop an collaborative decampment plan to go to
the Vancouver Park Board for approval with the goal of restoring the park for
broad public use, including the expansion of the positive activations program.
B. THAT the City, in partnership with key partners, create a dedicated, coordinated
cross-jurisdictional Homeless Outreach Services Team (HOST) that serves to
connect unsheltered and sheltered people to appropriate housing, health and
support services.

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, October 1, 2019 55
C. THAT the City and the Park Board explore opportunities to collaborate, and
potentially expand upon, the initial success of the peer-based Park Stewardship
pilot program with the aim to provide access to daily showers and washrooms at
specific field houses in city parks for those in need of this specific form of
support, with the facilities to be kept clean and supervised by peer stewards;
FURTHER THAT the City and Park Board explore options for identified needed
services, such as a community kitchen, additional accessible laundry and drying
facilities, and 24-hour sanitation facilities with running water.
D. THAT the City commit to supporting and seeking funding from the Provincial and
Federal governments to enable and expand supported employment initiatives
such as the aforementioned Park Stewardship Program, street ambassadors,
and other employment opportunities for individuals to gain income, build skills
and foster esteem.
E. THAT Council direct staff, in collaboration with community service agencies, to
undertake a review of Downtown Eastside services, with the goal of creating a
coordinated service delivery framework that effectively delivers a range of
services, including a coordinated outreach strategy, critical mental health and
addiction treatment, as well as access to appropriate housing, basic health care
needs, and other services.
F. THAT Council support the Vancouver Police Department (VPD) in its call for
increased mental health support through a new improved method of delivering
Cars 87 and 88, and related funding from Vancouver Coastal Health (VCH).
G. THAT Council call on the Province to increase vital wraparound services (mental
health, addiction treatment, social assistance etc.) in the next provincial budget
cycle.
