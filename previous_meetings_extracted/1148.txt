5. Supporting Small Businesses in Vancouver through Provincial Tax Reform
At the Regular Council meeting on June 13, 2017, Vancouver City Council referred this matter
to the Standing Committee on City Finance and Services meeting on June 14, 2017, to hear
from speakers.
The Committee heard from one speaker who expressed concerns about aspects of the motion,
and offered additional suggestions.
MOVED by Acting Mayor Louie
WHEREAS
1. Property assessments on both residential and commercial properties have
soared for successive years, posing significant affordability challenges to some
residents and businesses;
2. Business tenants on triple-net leases have limited ability to absorb
extraordinary increases in rent and to assume all the property taxes passed on
to them by their landlords based on highest and best use of the property;
3. The City of Vancouver has engaged with the Province of BC, BC Assessment
Authority and key stakeholders in assessing viable options to address the
impact of soaring property assessments on small business tenants;
4. The City of Vancouver has implemented targeted three-year land assessment
averaging program to alleviate some property tax impact arising from these
significant assessment increases, but will not be able to transition to five-year
land assessment averaging before 2019 due to a legislative restriction in the
Vancouver Charter.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Vancouver City Council call on the Province of BC to
enable the City to transition from three-year to five-year land assessment averaging in
2018 through an exemption to the legislative requirement or legislative amendments
as appropriate; and
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED THAT City staff report back on the outcome of their work
with the Province of BC, BC Assessment Authority and key stakeholders, with
associated policy recommendations that specifically address the impact of triple net
leases on property tax payments for small business tenants.

6. Acknowledgement of First Nations’ Role in Saving Lives during the Great Fire of
1886
At the Regular Council meeting on June 13, 2017, Vancouver City Council referred this matter
to the Standing Committee on City Finance and Services meeting on June 14, 2017, to hear
from speakers.
MOVED by Councillor Reimer
WHEREAS
1. On June 13, 1886 a large fire destroyed most buildings in the newly-
incorporated City of Vancouver leaving only three of the estimated 1,000
existent buildings;
2. The total number of lives lost is unknown, but over two dozen fatalities are
estimated. Only two of the bodies recovered were identifiable, the rest
described as "all burned to a crisp and barely recognizable as human remains";
3. The fire burned quickly, razing the city in less than 30 minutes. To survive,
people rushed to Burrard Inlet where they crowded onto docked boats or they
jumped into the water;
4. Many more people would have perished in the water if not for local First
Nations families. Despite being forcibly removed from their homelands and
crowded onto a small reserve across the Burrard inlet in Ustlawn, families—at
their own peril—chose to bring their own canoes and boats across the inlet to
rescue Vancouverites. They subsequently offered food and shelter until
Vancouver was rebuilt;
5. The life-sustaining role these First Nations families played was not
acknowledged at the time, nor is it well-referenced in historical accounts of
the Great Fire of 1886.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT the City of Vancouver publicly thank the
First Nations families who saved Vancouverites’ lives in the Great Fire of 1886
and properly commemorate them;
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED THAT staff ensure that these First Nations families are
appropriately recognized in City records and archives related to the Great Fire
of 1886.
CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY (Vote No. 02043)
The Committee adjourned at 8:20 pm.
