Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, April 26, 2023 10
MOVED by Councillor Zhou
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. Transportation decisions in Vancouver generally reflect a hierarchy of
transportation modes, with walking as the top priority;
2. Increasing the walkability and accessibility of Vancouver's streets and sidewalks
is a priority of the City and has been supported by successive City Councils,
including measures such as sidewalk curb ramps on street corners to create
access for people using wheelchairs, walkers, and strollers to enable all
residents to participate fully in the community, regardless of ability;i
3. According to Walk Score, Vancouver is considered to be a “Very Walkable” city
with an overall walk score of 80. Most errands can be accomplished on foot,
according to Walk Score, and some areas of the city have walk scores greater
than 80 such as Downtown (97), the West End (95), Fairview (93), Mount
Pleasant (92), and Strathcona (92);
4. Many cities around the world use pedestrian scrambles to provide safe and
accessible crossings in high-pedestrian areas. Pedestrian scrambles enhance
walkability, which encourages more people to choose travel options that are
active, healthy, and environmentally sustainable, while increasing foot traffic that
supports local business;
5. A pedestrian scramble is an exclusive pedestrian crossing phase at a signalized
intersection where vehicular movements are prohibited at all approaches while
pedestrians are permitted to cross diagonally and longitudinally. The separation
of vehicular and pedestrian movements is intended to reduce conflicts between
the two modes; ii
6. In July 2019, the City of Vancouver implemented a trial “all-walk” crosswalk
phase at Hornby and Robson whereby all vehicle traffic was stopped and
pedestrians could walk from any corner at the same time within the existing
painted crosswalks, around or through the four corners of Robson and Hornby
Street;
7. In contrast to the “all-walk” crosswalk trial at Hornby and Robson, a traditional
pedestrian scramble differs by allowing diagonal crossing in any direction through
an intersection;
8. A pedestrian scramble was considered in the design stage for the Hornby and
Robson trial, but the all-walk phase was chosen to provide increased walk time
for pedestrians who could also proceed in the south crosswalk with eastbound
left turning vehicles given that there would be no vehicle/pedestrian conflict within
the south crosswalk during this phase;
9. Public interest in a traditional pedestrian scramble in Vancouver, as opposed to
an all-walk crosswalk phase, is longstanding and has frequently been raised as
an option during planning and consultation processes. Potential locations for

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, April 26, 2023 11
pedestrian scrambles suggested by the public range from Broadway & Cambie to
the crossing at 1st and Commercial;
10. Subsequent to the Hornby and Robson all-walk phase trial, staff were set to
analyze the intersection operation to assess whether the longer-term roll-out
would also include diagonal crossing and whether it could be a new tool for the
City’s engineering action plan; iii
11. As of the current date, Vancouver has not piloted or trialed a traditional
pedestrian scramble crossing, including diagonal crossing, to assess its
effectiveness in the local Vancouver context and determine its value in terms of
the City’s pedestrian and traffic safety best practices and enhanced mobility.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to report back by the
end of Q3 2023 with recommendations and potential location options for a traditional
pedestrian scramble crossing pilot that includes diagonal crossing, inclusive of a range
of appropriate intersection examples in the city with high levels of pedestrian traffic in
order to assess the effectiveness of scramble crossings in the local Vancouver context
and determine their value in terms of the City’s pedestrian and traffic safety best
practices and enhanced mobility objectives.

_______________
i The City of Vancouver has long recognize the importance of sidewalk accessibility and has been installing over 200 curb ramps per
year since the 1960s. There are curb ramps on more than 95% of sidewalk curbs in the downtown core.
https://vancouver.ca/streets-transportation/pedestrian-accessibility.aspx
ii Pedestrian scramble phasing is most likely to be successful and have fewer violations at intersections with large volumes of both
pedestrians and motor vehicles. Pedestrian scramble phase usually creates a longer cycle length and wait between crossings.
https://vancouver.ca/files/cov/pedestrian-safety-study-2012-final-report.pdf
iii A joint safety study with UBC showed a 96% reduction in vehicle-pedestrian conflicts during the Hornby and Robson all-walk
phase trial. This pilot will become permanent as part of the Robson Plaza project, and a second all-walk phase crossing is to be
installed on the other side of the plaza at the Howe-Robson intersection. Staff will continue to look for other suitable locations for this
type of intervention. https://council.vancouver.ca/20200707/documents/r2.pdf

10. Protecting People on Cornwall Avenue (Members’ Motion B.3)
At the Council meeting on April 25, 2023, Council referred the following motion to the Standing
Committee on Policy and Strategic Priorities meeting on April 26, 2023, in order to hear from
speakers, followed by debate and decision.
The Committee heard from 10 speakers in support of the recommendations.

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, April 26, 2023 12
MOVED by Councillor Fry
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. Vancouver is committed to Vision Zero: ending all traffic-related serious injuries
and fatalities in the City of Vancouver;
2. Any amount of traffic-related serious injuries or fatalities on Vancouver streets is
unacceptable and the City of Vancouver should prioritize the safety and well-
being of residents;
3. There is strong evidence that vehicle speed increases both the probability and
severity of motor vehicle crashes, making speed reduction an important part of a
larger Vision Zero strategy. Studies show that if a driver hits a pedestrian at 50
km/h, the pedestrian only has approximately a 20% chance of survival, but that
their chance of survival goes up to 90% if the speed is 30 km/h;
4. In March 2023 the Schools on Arterials Slow Zones pilot launched and reduced
speeds on streets beside nine Elementary Schools, with a focus on reducing
accidents and improving safety for children and families. Henry Hudson
Elementary School is part of this pilot, with speed reduced to 40 km/h on
Cornwall Avenue between Cypress Street and Maple Street from 8:00 am - 5:00
pm on school days;
5. In light of a tragic car crash at the intersection of Cornwall Avenue and Arbutus
Street on July 20, 2022, local residents are asking for Council to expand the
Schools on Arterials Slow Zones pilot to protect all road users on Cornwall
Avenue, recognizing that Cornwall Avenue is used to access not just Henry
Hudson Elementary School, but also Henry Hudson Child Care Society pre-
school and daycare, Kitsilano Beach park, Kitsilano Pool, and several other key
social and cultural institutions in Vancouver and the homes of thousands of
residents; and
6. The Schools on Arterials Slow Zones pilot presents an opportunity to pilot an
expanded reduced speed pilot further along Cornwall, from Burrard Street to
Trafalgar, improving safety for thousands of residents, as well as thousands of
visitors to the area during the summer months, and to collect data to inform
longer term safety improvements for drivers, passengers, pedestrians, people on
bikes, and micromobility users.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
THAT Vancouver City Council direct staff to extend the Schools on Arterials Slow
Zones pilot on Cornwall Avenue, specifically by reducing the speed limit for all of
Cornwall Avenue (Trafalgar Street through to Burrard Street), and reducing the
speed to 30 km/h at all times (24/7), and to so do by July 2023, to maximize
safety benefits for thousands of summer visitors to Kitsilano Beach and Kitsilano
Pool; and

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, April 26, 2023 13
FURTHER THAT staff collect data on the expanded Cornwall slow zone and
report back, as part of the report back on results of the pilot in Spring 2024, to
make other recommendations for improving safety on Cornwall Avenue for
pedestrians, people on bikes, micromobility users, drivers and passengers,
including for:
a. Improving visibility for drivers by removing parking in sections that
obstruct sightlines;
b. Consideration of adding bollards or other barriers to protect Henry
Hudson Elementary School and Henry Hudson Child Care Society, as
well as possible bollards on the NW corner of Cornwall and Arbutus
between the sidewalk and the park space;
c. Prohibiting left turns between 7am and 7pm, unless there is a turning
lane and turn signal or an intersection controlled by stop signs, and
looking to add dedicated turn phases at intersections where possible;
d. Adding leading pedestrian intervals at all controlled crosswalks; and
e. Working with TransLink to incorporate bus priority measures to reflect
the high volume of transit riders that use this corridor and to maximize
the safety benefits of transit use, including considering bus bulbs
and/or bus lanes.

July 2023,” be struck and replaced with “further westward from Maple Street along
Cornwall, as an expansion of the current slow zones pilot adjacent to Henry Hudson
Elementary School between Cypress and Maple Streets, with a speed reduction to 40
km/h as per the slow zones pilot as soon as possible but no later than July 2023,”.
FURTHER THAT the second paragraph the words “data on the expanded Corwall slow

expanded reduced speed pilot further along Cornwall, from Burrard Street to
Trafalgar, improving safety for thousands of residents, as well as thousands of
visitors to the area during the summer months, and to collect data to inform
longer term safety improvements for drivers, passengers, pedestrians, people on
bikes, and micromobility users.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
THAT Vancouver City Council direct staff to extend the Schools on Arterials Slow Zones
pilot on Cornwall Avenue further westward from Maple Street along Cornwall, as an
expansion of the current slow zones pilot adjacent to Henry Hudson Elementary School
between Cypress and Maple Streets, with a speed reduction to 40 km/h as per the slow
zones pilot as soon as possible but no later than July 2023, to maximize safety benefits
for thousands of summer visitors to Kitsilano Beach and Kitsilano Pool;
FURTHER THAT staff report back to Council in the spring of 2024 with any further safety
measures and considerations that may be required following the pilot phase for the
improved protection of pedestrians, people on bikes, micromobility users, drivers and
passengers, including but not limited to such potential measures as:
a. Improving visibility for drivers by removing parking in sections that
obstruct sightlines;
b. Consideration of adding bollards or other barriers to protect Henry
Hudson Elementary School and Henry Hudson Child Care Society, as
well as possible bollards on the NW corner of Cornwall and Arbutus
between the sidewalk and the park space;
c. Prohibiting left turns between 7am and 7pm, unless there is a turning lane
and turn signal or an intersection controlled by stop signs, and looking to
add dedicated turn phases at intersections where possible;
d. Adding leading pedestrian intervals at all controlled crosswalks; and
