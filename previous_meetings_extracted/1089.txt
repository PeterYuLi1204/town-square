8. Creating Optimal Conditions for Small Businesses to Succeed and Thrive in the
City of Vancouver
At the Regular Council meeting on January 16, 2018, Vancouver City Council referred the
motion set out below to the Standing Committee on Policy and Strategic Priorities meeting
on January 17, 2018, to hear from speakers.
The motion below contains amendments to the original Motion on Notice, which were
accepted by the Committee.
MOVED by Councillor Affleck
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. Small businesses make up 95 per cent of all businesses in Vancouver and
are the backbone, and an important driver, of Vancouver’s local
economy, fostering local entrepreneurship and creating jobs;
2. The central mission of Vancouver City Council and the City of Vancouver
is to create a great city of communities, a city that cares about its
people, the environment, and the opportunities to live, work, and
prosper;
3. In June 2013, Mayor Gregor Robertson presented a motion to Council
(title: “Support Local Small Businesses”) – carried unanimously at the
Tuesday, June 25, 2013 Regular Council Meeting – in which he called for
the Vancouver Economic Commission to be asked “to work with City
staff, Vancouver BIAs and the Vancouver Board of Trade to recommend
immediate and long-term actions the City can take to support the
retention and growth of locally owned small businesses, as well as
identify opportunities to expedite recommendations within the
Economic Action Strategy”, and for the Vancouver Economic Commission
to “report back to Council with a proposed scope of work, including
involvement with the local small business community, by September
2013.”;
4. Mayor Gregor Robertson’s June 2013 motion (title: “Support Local Small
Businesses”) noted the following points:
• Small, locally owned businesses are a crucial component of
economic activity and job creation in Vancouver.

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, January 17, 2018 11
• Businesses comprised of 1-4 employees make up 58% of all
businesses in Vancouver, businesses with 5-9 employees make up
18%, and businesses with 10-19 employees make up 11%.
• The retention and expansion of small, local businesses is a
priority for Vancouver within the Vancouver Economic Action
Strategy.
• Small businesses are an integral part of the neighbourhood
character in Vancouver’s commercial areas.
• A wide variety of factors can impact small businesses, such as
affordability, access to space, taxes and regulation, development
pressures, transportation issues, and commercial leases.
• The City has taken a number of steps to support small business
and enable a competitive economic climate, such as moving
towards a mobile business license, reducing the property tax
burden for businesses as recommended by the Property Tax
Policy Review Commission, reducing the number of business
license categories from 636 to less than 200, and reducing the
City’s net debt by $151.4 million in 2012.
5. Similarly, in November 2010, Councillors Woodsworth and Cadman called
for Vancouver City Council “to establish a ‘one stop shop’ to provide a
single destination for services and support for small businesses in
Vancouver, including but not limited to advice, referrals, and permits”;
6. At the Thursday, November 4, 2010 Standing Committee of Council on
City Services and Budgets, Councillor Deal moved to refer Councillor
Woodsworth’s November 2010 motion back to staff as part of “the
Vancouver Service Review”, and to have it noted that “Council reaffirms
its commitment to small business….”;
7. On Thursday, February 2, 2017, the City of Vancouver launched a
“Commercial Renovation Centre” in response to various needs identified
by the business community;
8. The “Commercial Renovation Centre” aims to help new business owners
navigate the process for licensing a small business or renovating a
commercial tenant space by providing hands-on support related to
regulations, permits and procedures;
9. Despite the City of Vancouver’s many efforts over the past decade to
support and retain small businesses, there are numerous indications
that the city’s small business sector is experiencing significant stress
related to widespread unaffordability and high property taxes, leading
to the closure of numerous long-time Vancouver businesses (for
example, West End kitchenware store, Chocolate Mousse, which will
reportedly close in January 2019 after more than 30 years due to an
almost 93 per cent jump in property taxes after the building’s assessed
value more than tripled from $16 million to $52 million);

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, January 17, 2018 12
10. Councillor Louie (as Vision Vancouver’s point person on city taxes and
finances), is quoted in a recent Vancouver Sun article as stating, “What
we have been focusing on is trying to figure out a way to support small
business owners,” and expressed his view that “punishing triple-net
lease agreements made between small business owners and property
owners”, set against sky-high property assessments, are the “culprit”
behind recent and widely anticipated future retail business closures;
11. Actions to date by the City of Vancouver to support the city’s small
business community – the backbone of Vancouver’s local economy – have
not been fully effective in achieving Council’s small business policy
objectives;
12. Vancouver City Council has established numerous agencies, boards, and
committees that focus on particular subjects that have an impact on the
City of Vancouver and its people, thereby harnessing the specialized
expertise of the respective members of these bodies to advise Council
and City staffl; advisory bodies which variously include, among others:
• Children, Youth and Families Advisory Committee
• LGBTQ2+ Advisory Committee
• Persons with Disabilities Advisory Committee
• Renters Advisory Committee
• Seniors' Advisory Committee
• Trans, Gender Diverse and Two-Spirit Inclusion Advisory
Committee
• Urban Aboriginal Peoples Advisory Committee
• Vancouver Food Policy Council
• Active Transportation Policy Council
• Arts and Culture Policy Council
• Public Art Committee
• Mayor's Engaged City Task Force
• Mayor's Task Force on Housing Affordability
• Mayor's Task Force on Mental Health and Addictions
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Vancouver City Council direct City staff to conduct a systematic
and comprehensive review of all existing City of Vancouver programs
and policies designed to support and retain local small business and
report back to Council within 90 days with recommendations for policies
and strategies the City can implement, and actions that can be taken by
the City, to create more optimal conditions for small businesses to
succeed and thrive in the City of Vancouver, including, but not limited
to, the creation of a Small Business Retention Program which could,
among other potential actions, offer targeted property tax reductions to
commercial property owners to help retain existing small business
tenants.

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, January 17, 2018 13
B. THAT Vancouver City Council establish a Small Business Advisory
Committee (not type A or B) with a mandate to advise staff and City
Council on strategic priorities relating to small business in Vancouver;
FURTHER THAT the Small Business Advisory Committee terms of
reference shall include, but not be limited to:
• Provide input to City Council and staff about issues of concern to
the city’s small business community.
• Consider any matters which may be referred to the Advisory
Committee Council by Council or staff.
• Take positions on policy initiatives from other levels of
government within the mandate of the Advisory Committee.
• Work co-operatively with other agencies whose activities affect
constituent small business communities, including initiating and
developing relevant projects.
• Act as a resource for staff coordinating public involvement
processes and civic events.
• Exchange information with constituent small business
communities and the general public about relevant programs and
issues of interest.
• Engage in outreach to disseminate information and encourage
participation from constituent small business communities.
• Produce an annual work plan with specific objectives by no later
than April of each year, in consultation with Council and staff
liaisons, for distribution to Council and civic departments for
information.
• Submit an annual report to Council describing the Advisory
Committee’s accomplishments for the year, including reference
to each objective set out in the work plan and any arising issues
to which the Advisory Committee has responded.

its commitment to small business….”;
7. On Thursday, February 2, 2017, the City of Vancouver launched a
“Commercial Renovation Centre” in response to various needs identified
by the business community;
8. The “Commercial Renovation Centre” aims to help new business owners
navigate the process for licensing a small business or renovating a
commercial tenant space by providing hands-on support related to
regulations, permits and procedures;
9. Despite the City of Vancouver’s many efforts over the past decade to
support and retain small businesses, there are numerous indications
that the city’s small business sector is experiencing significant stress
related to widespread unaffordability and high property taxes, leading
to the closure of numerous long-time Vancouver businesses (for
example, West End kitchenware store, Chocolate Mousse, which will
reportedly close in January 2019 after more than 30 years due to an
almost 93 per cent jump in property taxes after the building’s assessed
value more than tripled from $16 million to $52 million);
10. Councillor Louie (as Vision Vancouver’s point person on city taxes and
finances), is quoted in a recent Vancouver Sun article as stating, “What
we have been focusing on is trying to figure out a way to support small
business owners,” and expressed his view that “punishing triple-net
lease agreements made between small business owners and property
owners”, set against sky-high property assessments, are the “culprit”
behind recent and widely anticipated future retail business closures;
11. Actions to date by the City of Vancouver to support the city’s small
business community – the backbone of Vancouver’s local economy –
have not been fully effective in achieving Council’s small business policy
objectives;

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, January 17, 2018 17
12. Vancouver City Council has established numerous agencies, boards, and
committees that focus on particular subjects that have an impact on the
City of Vancouver and its people, thereby harnessing the specialized
expertise of the respective members of these bodies to advise Council
and City staff, advisory bodies which variously include, among others:
• Children, Youth and Families Advisory Committee
• LGBTQ2+ Advisory Committee
• Persons with Disabilities Advisory Committee
• Renters Advisory Committee
• Seniors' Advisory Committee
• Trans, Gender Diverse and Two-Spirit Inclusion Advisory
Committee
• Urban Aboriginal Peoples Advisory Committee
• Vancouver Food Policy Council
• Active Transportation Policy Council
• Arts and Culture Policy Council
• Public Art Committee
• Mayor's Engaged City Task Force

THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Vancouver City Council direct City staff to conduct a systematic
and comprehensive review of all existing City of Vancouver programs
and policies designed to support and retain local small business and
report back to Council within 90 days with recommendations for policies
and strategies the City can implement, and actions that can be taken by
the City, to create more optimal conditions for small businesses to
succeed and thrive in the City of Vancouver, including, but not limited
to, the creation of a Small Business Retention Program which could,
among other potential actions, offer targeted property tax reductions to
commercial property owners to help retain existing small business
tenants.
B. THAT staff report back to Council within 90 days with recommendations
for establishing a small business advisory body or roundtable, with
proposed structure and terms of reference, to advise City Council on
strategic priorities to support small business in Vancouver, including the
recommendations and actions brought forward in the review in A above.

the city’s small business community.
