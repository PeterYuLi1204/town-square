COUNCIL MEMBERS’ MOTIONS
1. Advocating for Climate-Resilient Housing Standards in Response to Extreme Heat
Events

Prior to introducing Members’ Motion 1. “Advocating for Climate-Resilient Housing Standards in
Response to Extreme Heat Events,” Chair Meiszner and Vice-Chair Dominato relinquished the
Chair to Mayor Sim until the conclusion of the item.
* * * * *
The Committee heard from one speaker who spoke in support of the report recommendations.
MOVED by Councillor Dominato
SECONDED by Councillor Meiszner
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. The City of Vancouver is increasingly affected by extreme heat events which
pose significant and serious health risks for residents, especially those living in
multi-unit residential buildings where adequate cooling is often limited;
2. The Strata Property Act lacks provisions that ensure access to cooling measures
which are vital to the health and well-being of residents living in strata housing,
particularly in the context of rising temperatures due to climate change;
3. In response to rising temperatures and the increase in extreme heat events, a
“right to cool” has emerged as an essential component of housing policy that
ensures the right of residents to access indoor cooling solutions to safeguard

Standing Committee on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, November 27, 2024 11
their health and comfort. This fundamental right is particularly relevant for
individuals living in multi-unit residential buildings where access to adequate
active or passive cooling systems may be restricted by strata by-laws or
structural limitations;
4. Enabling and incentivizing the installation of heat pumps and/or passive cooling
approaches (e.g. external shades, window replacement or coverings, white roofs,
etc.) in strata units and other multi-unit residential buildings including rentals
would provide thermally safe, energy-efficient, and climate-resilient solutions for
cooling homes, reducing the impact of extreme heat on health and quality of life;
5. In 2023, the Province of British Columbia announced updates to the BC Building
Code, effective March 8, 2024, which require that all new residential buildings
provide at least one living space designed to remain at or below 26°C. This
measure aims to protect health and comfort by providing a thermally safe room in
each dwelling unit in extreme heat conditions, marking a step toward climate-
resilient housing for new builds across the Province;
6. The Vancouver Charter (VC) currently authorizes the City to set minimum
temperature standards in residential buildings to protect residents. However, the
VC does not extend this same authority to regulating maximum indoor
temperatures, which limits the City’s ability to protect residents from the serious
health risks posed by extreme heat events such as the 2021 heat dome;
7. On June 11, 2024, Vancouver City Council approved a staff recommendation to
formally request that the Province of British Columbia amend Section 330(k) of
the VC to allow for Council to enact by-laws requiring buildings to maintain a
maximum indoor air temperature, as outlined in the report "Improving the
Effectiveness of the Standards of Maintenance (SOM) By-law.";1
8. The proposed VC amendment aims to enable future by-law amendments for
cooling temperature controls, such as permitting and/or requiring the
maintenance of mechanical air conditioning units or heat-shielding window
coverings. If the VC amendment is enacted by the Province, the City’s ongoing
Multi-family Cooling Study—conducted in partnership with Metro Vancouver,
Vancouver Coastal Health (VCH), and the City of North Vancouver—could inform
future policy levers available to address extreme heat solutions; and
9. By adopting this motion in response to extreme heat events and advocating for
climate-resilient housing standards and measures, and a collaborative, cross-
jurisdictional approach to protect the health and well-being of residents across
the region, Council would be demonstrating its commitment to addressing the
urgent impacts of climate change and extreme heat on housing safety for
residents.
1 "Improving the Effectiveness of the Standards of Maintenance (SOM) By-law." (Vote No. 10045) carried unanimously.

Standing Committee on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, November 27, 2024 12
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
THAT Vancouver City Council call upon the Province of British Columbia to adopt the
following measures to ensure climate-resilient, thermally safe housing for residents in
the City of Vancouver and across British Columbia:
i. Vancouver Charter Amendment for Regulating Maximum Indoor
Temperatures: Reaffirm Vancouver’s request to amend Section 330(k) of the
Vancouver Charter, granting the City the authority to set maximum safe indoor
temperatures in residential buildings to protect residents’ health and safety during
extreme heat events.
ii. Strata Property Act Amendment to Enshrine a "Right to Cool": Urge the
Province to amend the Strata Property Act to recognize a "right to cool," allowing
residents of strata buildings access to cooling solutions, including the installation
of air conditioning, heat pumps, or passive cooling measures, without
unreasonable restrictions from strata corporations.
iii. Incentives for Strata Owners to Install Heat Pumps and/or passive cooling
approaches: Advocate for provincial incentives, grants, or subsidies specifically
for individual strata owners to install heat pumps as energy-efficient, climate-
resilient cooling solutions, and to expand eligibility for these incentives to include
multi-unit residential and strata properties.
FURTHER THAT Council empower the Mayor to write to the Province on behalf of
Council to advocate for enactment of the climate resilience measures and standards
outlined in this motion;
AND FURTHER THAT Council endorse the following resolution for submission to the
2025 Union of BC Municipalities (UBCM) convention for the consideration of the
membership:
RESOLUTION
MOTION: Advocating for Climate-Resilient Housing Standards in
Response to Extreme Heat Events
WHEREAS the Province of British Columbia announced updates to the BC
Building Code in 2023, effective March 8, 2024, which requires that all new
residential buildings provide at least one living space in each dwelling unit
designed to remain at or below 26°C. This measure aims to protect health and
comfort in extreme heat conditions, marking a step toward climate-resilient,
thermally safe housing for new builds across the Province;
AND WHEREAS in response to rising temperatures and an increase in extreme
heat events, a “right to cool” for residents to access indoor cooling solutions to
safeguard their health and comfort has emerged as an essential component of
housing policy, particularly for individuals living in multi-unit residential buildings,
where access to adequate active or passive cooling systems may be restricted
by strata bylaws or structural limitations:

Standing Committee on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, November 27, 2024 13
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT the Union of BC Municipalities (UBCM)
call on the Provincial government to amend the Strata Property Act to recognize
and enshrine a "right to cool" as a fundamental right for residents of strata and
multi-unit residential buildings to access cooling solutions, including the
installation of air conditioning or heat pumps or passive cooling approaches
without unreasonable restrictions from strata corporations, and that the Province
likewise recognize a “right to cool” as an essential component of provincial
housing policy, including – but not limited to – creating provincial incentives for
strata owners to install heat pumps and other cooling measures to ensure that
climate-resilient, thermally safe housing is available for all residents of British
Columbia.

2. Formalizing the 100 Block of Robson Street as a Dedicated Fan Zone
The Committee heard from one speaker who spoke in support of the report recommendations.
MOVED by Councillor Meiszner
SECONDED by Councillor Montague
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. Fan zones create a centralized hub of activity around sporting and other major
events that fosters a sense of community and camaraderie among fans. The
communal atmosphere of a fan zone is not only enjoyable for attendees it also
helps to build a strong, unified fan base for teams that helps to boost team
morale and a winning spirit;
2. Successful fan zones have been implemented in various cities around the world,
each bringing its unique approach to enhancing the fan experience. Fan zones
often feature a variety of entertainment options, including live music and
interactive games, as well as food and beverage stalls, all of which contribute to
a festive and engaging environment for fans;
3. Dedicated fan zones are a strategic enhancement to events that offer a dynamic
and immersive experience for fans, economic benefits for the city and local
businesses, marketing opportunities for brands, and improved safety and
organization for public gatherings;

Standing Committee on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, November 27, 2024 14
4. Examples of successful fan zones include the Liverpool Football Club fan zone
that serves as a gathering place for team supporters before the game and offers
a range of activities and amenities that build excitement and community spirit.
Similarly, Twickenham Stadium in London has the West Fan Village, which
provides an ultimate pre-game fan experience with live bands, acts, and
interviews;
5. Closer to home, Toronto’s Nathan Phillips Square hosts fan zones for various
sports and cultural events. And during the NBA playoffs, Maple Leaf Square
becomes a popular gathering spot for Toronto Raptors fans as “Jurassic Park”;
6. In Vancouver, the 100 block of Robson Street, situated between Beatty Street
and Cambie Street, has evolved organically in recent years into a vibrant and
popular fan celebration zone for events at BC Place, including, but not limited to,
sporting events such as BC Lions games and Vancouver Whitecaps games;
7. The frequent but temporary conversion of the 100 block of Robson Street, from a
vehicle thoroughfare to a pedestrian fan zone, has demonstrated the feasibility
and desirability of such fan zone transformations, contributing positively to the
city's culture and economy and enhancing the celebratory fan experience;
8. Dedicated fan zones such as the 100 block of Robson improve the overall safety
and organization of large public gatherings by providing a designated area for
fans to congregate – before, during and after an event – thereby reducing the risk
of potential disturbances through a better-controlled environment for everyone
involved;
9. Fan zones represent a modern approach to event management, one that
recognizes the importance of fan engagement and community involvement in the
success of events and the vitality of urban spaces;
10. The key to a successful fan zone lies in a design that is focused on the fan
experience and considers such factors as the flow of visitors, the range of
activities offered, and the overall comfort and convenience of the space. In some
cases, more robust temporary structures, such as pop-up shops, kiosks, and
bollards are used to provide a professional appearance to the space and
improved usability for fans; and
11. Once established, the success of a dedicated fan zone can have long-lasting
benefits for a city including increased revenue, not just from direct sales during
events but also from the positive reputation it builds and enhancement of the
city's profile as a vibrant and engaging destination.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council and the City of Vancouver formally recognize the 100 block of
Robson Street as a dedicated fan zone and acknowledge its significance and the
value it adds to sporting and other events in the city.

Standing Committee on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, November 27, 2024 15
B. THAT Council direct staff to explore potential improvements to the 100 block of
Robson Street of a more permanent nature that would facilitate the more rapid
and efficient temporary conversion of this section of Robson Street and its
surrounds into a fan zone on a regular temporary basis, such as enhanced road
surface and sidewalk treatments, as well as street furniture, lighting, and
retractable bollards, thereby ensuring minimal disruption to the surrounding
neighbourhood and maximum enjoyment for fans and other stakeholders;
FURTHER THAT staff be directed to report back before the end of Q2 2025 with
a detailed plan and timeline to formalize and improve the 100 block of Robson
Street as a dedicated fan zone, including:
i. A budget for improvements which could include, but is not limited to:
a. Infrastructure such as electrical connections to support modular fan
zone components, such as kiosks, stages, etc. that can be quickly
assembled and disassembled; as well as infrastructure for overhead
and accent lighting, etc.;
b. improved waste management options and resources;
c. public transportation options and enhancements to and from the zone;
d. accessibility measures; and
e. options to accommodate community activities and events such as
farmers and artisan markets outside of sporting events, thereby
maximizing the use of this public space and the investments made.
ii. Options for delivering the fan zone improvements incrementally in tandem
with the approved bike lane upgrades on Beatty Street and the hotel
project at 828 Cambie, which is obligated to deliver frontage
improvements along Robson Street, in order to achieve project timing
efficiencies, including any other construction projects in the 100 block of
Robson that may coincide with the fan zone initiative; and
iii. Exploration of potential funding contributions from PavCo and/or private
sponsor(s) as part of the options to fund the fan zone project.

FINAL MOTION AS APPROVED
WHEREAS
1. Fan zones create a centralized hub of activity around sporting and other major
events that fosters a sense of community and camaraderie among fans. The
communal atmosphere of a fan zone is not only enjoyable for attendees it also
helps to build a strong, unified fan base for teams that helps to boost team
morale and a winning spirit;
2. Successful fan zones have been implemented in various cities around the world,
each bringing its unique approach to enhancing the fan experience. Fan zones
often feature a variety of entertainment options, including live music and
interactive games, as well as food and beverage stalls, all of which contribute to
a festive and engaging environment for fans;
3. Dedicated fan zones are a strategic enhancement to events that offer a dynamic
and immersive experience for fans, economic benefits for the city and local
businesses, marketing opportunities for brands, and improved safety and
organization for public gatherings;
4. Examples of successful fan zones include the Liverpool Football Club fan zone
that serves as a gathering place for team supporters before the game and offers
a range of activities and amenities that build excitement and community spirit.
Similarly, Twickenham Stadium in London has the West Fan Village, which

Standing Committee on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, November 27, 2024 17
provides an ultimate pre-game fan experience with live bands, acts, and
interviews;
5. Closer to home, Toronto’s Nathan Phillips Square hosts fan zones for various
sports and cultural events. And during the NBA playoffs, Maple Leaf Square
becomes a popular gathering spot for Toronto Raptors fans as “Jurassic Park”;
6. In Vancouver, the 100 block of Robson Street, situated between Beatty Street
and Cambie Street, has evolved organically in recent years into a vibrant and
popular fan celebration zone for events at BC Place, including, but not limited to,
sporting events such as BC Lions games and Vancouver Whitecaps games;
7. The frequent but temporary conversion of the 100 block of Robson Street, from a
vehicle thoroughfare to a pedestrian fan zone, has demonstrated the feasibility
and desirability of such fan zone transformations, contributing positively to the
city's culture and economy and enhancing the celebratory fan experience;
8. Dedicated fan zones such as the 100 block of Robson improve the overall safety
and organization of large public gatherings by providing a designated area for
fans to congregate – before, during and after an event – thereby reducing the risk
of potential disturbances through a better-controlled environment for everyone
involved;
9. Fan zones represent a modern approach to event management, one that
recognizes the importance of fan engagement and community involvement in the
success of events and the vitality of urban spaces;
10. The key to a successful fan zone lies in a design that is focused on the fan
experience and considers such factors as the flow of visitors, the range of
activities offered, and the overall comfort and convenience of the space. In some
cases, more robust temporary structures, such as pop-up shops, kiosks, and
bollards are used to provide a professional appearance to the space and
improved usability for fans; and
11. Once established, the success of a dedicated fan zone can have long-lasting
benefits for a city including increased revenue, not just from direct sales during
events but also from the positive reputation it builds and enhancement of the
city's profile as a vibrant and engaging destination.

3. Ensuring Councillors Motions Maintain Public Confidence in the Good Rule of the
City
The Committee heard from two speakers who spoke in support of the report recommendations.
MOVED by Councillor Carr
SECONDED by Councillor Fry
WHEREAS
1. The City of Vancouver Procedure By-law No. 12577 Section 8.7 (see
https://bylaws.vancouver.ca/12577c.pdf ) states that the Chair may refuse to
open a motion for debate if the Chair decides the motion is out of order
because it:
(a) is not compatible with the purposes and objects of the Vancouver Charter
including the good rule and government of the City, or the health, safety,
and welfare of its inhabitants;
(b) conflicts with a law or by-law;
(c) conflicts with a resolution previously passed and still in force;
However, it can often be difficult for Council members, who normally call a point
of order, and the Chair to make that determination.
2. Vancouver’s Code of Conduct By-Law No. 12886 Part 2 states that a member of
Council must uphold certain standards and values including: (see
https://vancouver.ca/docs/council/12886_Code_of_Conduct_Bylaw.pdf)
• fairness: a member must consider all issues consistently and fairly, and in
light of all relevant facts, opinions and analysis of which a member should be
reasonably aware;
• integrity: a member must avoid improper use of influence and avoid all
conflicts of interest, both apparent and real;
• leadership in the public interest: a member must act in the best interests of
the city as a whole, and without regard to the member’s personal interests;
and
• responsibility: a member must respect and comply with the Acts of the
Parliament of Canada, the Legislature of British Columbia, including the
Vancouver Charter, city by-laws, and applicable city policies, and avoid
conduct that, reasonably, undermines, or has the potential to undermine,
public confidence in city governance, except members may participate in
peaceful civil disobedience.

Standing Committee on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, November 27, 2024 20
3. Vancouver’s Code of Conduct By-Law No. 12886 also states in Section 3.4,
“Without limiting the ability of a Council Member to hold a position on an issue
and respectfully express their opinions, a Council Member must: (b) ensure that
all communications relating to Council business are accurate and not issue any
communication that the member knows, or ought to have known, to be false.”
In a time that is being called the age of disinformation, it is especially important to
disclose sources of information in order to maintain public confidence and trust
that government decision-making is both grounded in accurate information and in
the best public interest.
See: https://www.canada.ca/en/democratic-institutions/services/protecting-
democratic-institutions/countering-disinformation-guidebook-public-servants.html
4. The process to submit a Council member’s motion for a Standing Committee
agenda is covered in the city’s Procedure By-law. The process includes timelines
that enable inclusion of the motion in publicly posted council agendas, giving
sufficient time for the public and media to review and for people to provide input
to Council and register to speak to the motion.
5. During debate on a staff report or other matters for decision at Council, Council
members regularly table motions and amendments without any advance public
notice nor notice to staff or other Councillors during debate on a staff report. In
most cases it is clear and transparent that the motions and amendments arise
from Council discussion and debate of the matter as well as from public input and
speakers. If that is not the case, public trust in good and transparent government
decision-making can be jeopardized.
6. The City of Vancouver Procedure By-law 12577 also states in Sections 13.24
and 13.25 the procedure to follow to enable a Council member who is absent for
part of a public hearing to vote on the matter:
S. 13.24 - A Council member who is absent for part of a public hearing that is
concluded in one day, or for part of the last day of a public hearing that lasts
longer than one day, may only vote on a motion regarding amendment or
approval in principle of the proposed by-law or by-laws if the Council member
first receives or reviews a public hearing summary during a 10 minute recess
called for that purpose, except that the Council member may not vote on the
motion if the public hearing summary cannot be reasonably presented or
reviewed during the 10-minute recess.
S. 13.25 - A Council member who is absent for part of a public hearing that lasts
longer than one day, other than for part of the last day of the public hearing, may
only vote on a motion regarding amendment or approval in principle of the
proposed by-law or by-laws if the Council member first receives or reviews a
public hearing summary, which must include the video recording of that part of
the public hearing that was conducted in the absence of the Council member.

Standing Committee on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, November 27, 2024 21
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED:
THAT Council direct staff to review the City of Vancouver Procedure By-law and other
documents, procedures and training, including, if appropriate, the City’s Code of
Conduct By-Law after the current Council-directed review of the Integrity Commissioner
office is complete, and report back to Council with recommendations to better ensure
that Councillors’ motions and decisions align with the good rule and good governance of
the city including:
i. Processes and procedures to help a member of Council or the Chair of a
Council meeting, including with the obligatory input of staff, determine if a
Council motion conflicts with a law or bylaw or resolution previously passed
that is still in effect;
ii. Criteria related to public trust in good and transparent government decision-
making that identify the type and scope of motions that public consultation;
iii. When, how and for what types of motions, Council members should publicly
disclose the main or most significant sources of information and collaboration,
possibly including meetings with individuals including with the City of
Vancouver’s and/or Mayor’s office staff, in accordance with the Code of
Conduct Sections 2 c) a member must avoid improper use of influence and
avoid all conflicts of interest both apparent and real, and 2.(g) transparency –
a member must conduct their duties in an open and transparent manner;
iv. Criteria and best practices regarding whether and when a Council member’s
amendment or new motion to a Council meeting agenda item should be
made public in advance of a meeting to provide time for staff and Council
members to review the motion and to provide the public with the opportunity
to provide input;
v. Incorporating into the City’s Procedure By-law a similar procedure to that of a
Public Hearing to enable a Council member who is absent for part or all of a
regular Council meeting agenda item and who wishes to vote on that agenda
item to request a briefing on the proceedings and debate that they missed in
the form of a verbal summary from City Clerk staff during a 10-minute recess
called for that purpose; and
vi. Incorporating into onboarding and ongoing training for Council members,
including with the city’s Integrity Commissioner, best practices to achieve
good rule and governance, and leadership in the public interest for the city as
a whole.
