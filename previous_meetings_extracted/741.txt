At the reconvened Council meeting on October 13, 2020, Council heard from speakers and
referred questions to staff, debate and decision on the report dated September 8, 2020, to the
Council meeting on October 20, 2020, as Unfinished Business.
Council also had before a Memorandum from Sandra Singh, General Manager, Arts, Culture
and Community Services, dated October 19, 2020, that informed Council that based on what
was heard at Council on October 13, 2020, the Funder has requested an amendment in the
report to allow for a direct lease with the City for this site to address public concerns. Based
upon discussions with the Funder, staff recommended changes to the report for
Recommendations B, C and D only pertaining to RainCity Housing and Support Society.
MOVED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
SECONDED by Councillor Hardwick
A. THAT Council authorize the Director of Real Estate Services to negotiate and
execute the modification of an existing lease (the “SWAN Lease”) with
Supporting Women’s Alternatives Network (SWAN Vancouver) Society (“SWAN”)

Premises”), to incorporate any required changes to the SWAN Lease to effect the
following modifications:
i. Removing the current 1st floor unit 101 (580 square feet of exclusive use
area) from the Leased Premises, and replacing it with unit 325 on the 3rd
floor (1,654 square feet of exclusive use area), as shown on Appendix A,
thereby increasing the total exclusive use area of the Leased Premises by
1,074 square feet for a new total of 1,654 square feet. The increased floor
area results in a commensurate increase in the amount payable at the
current rate as “Building Operating Costs” as provided for in Sections
1.08 and 1.09 of the SWAN Lease (from currently $4,930/annum to
$14,059/annum, plus applicable sales taxes);
ii. The modification of lease (the “Modification”), including for clarity the
increase to Building Operating Costs referenced in Recommendation A.i
above, shall take effect on November 1, 2020 (the “Effective Date”).
SWAN shall be permitted early possession of the new location of the
Leased Premises beginning October 16, 2020, to accommodate the move
and transition of operations by SWAN from their current unit 101; and
iii. The Modification shall incorporate any changes to the SWAN Lease as
deemed necessary to effect the provisions as set out in this
Recommendation A, but shall otherwise be on the same terms and
conditions set out in the SWAN Lease, and upon such other terms and
conditions to the satisfaction of the Director of Legal Services in

Council Meeting
Minutes, October 20, 2020 5
consultation with the General Manager of Real Estate and Facilities
Management and the General Manager of Arts, Culture, and Community
Services;
FURTHER THAT as the rent for the additional floor area to be included in the
Leased Premises will be below the applicable market rate and includes
rent-in-lieu of property taxes, Recommendation A constitutes a grant valued at
approximately $42,423 per annum for the incremental floor area of 1,074 sq ft,
and approximately $65,333 per annum for the new total floor area of 1,654 sq ft,
based on the current year of the Term.
B. THAT Council approve the following government health agency to occupy and be

Vancouver Coastal Health Authority (“VCH”).
C. THAT Council authorize the Director of Real Estate Services to negotiate and
execute a lease agreement with VCH for #101 – 1101 Seymour Street (the “VCH
Lease”). The VCH Lease shall be based on the following terms and conditions,
and upon such other terms and conditions to the satisfaction of the General
Manager of Real Estate and Facilities Management, the General Manager of
Arts, Culture and Community Services and the Director of Legal Services:
i. Term and Renewal Options: One year and 5 months commencing November
1, 2020, plus one renewal option for a further two (2) years;
ii. Rent and Operating Costs: Total Rent of $27,840 per annum, inclusive of
payment in lieu of property taxes, plus applicable sales taxes.

1101 Seymour Street to staff to explore alternate city-owned locations that are
not directly adjacent to a park, children’s playground or school, including
consideration for locations that have outdoor space for safe inhalation, and to

B. Council Members’ Motions
1. Replacing Gendered and Patriarchal Language in the Vancouver Charter
MOVED by Councillor Fry
SECONDED by Councillor Bligh
WHEREAS
1. The Vancouver Charter (“Charter”) is the provincial statute that incorporates and
empowers the City of Vancouver and its governance;
2. The Charter was first passed in 1953 and has been amended and updated since
that time by acts of the Provincial Legislature;

Council Meeting
Minutes, October 20, 2020 29
3. The Charter variously references gendered language that embeds a historical
patriarchal hierarchy, in particular in Part IV — Duties of Mayor, Director of
Finance, City Clerk, City Treasurer, and Auditors. For example:
a. Section 209. (Mayor)
If at any time the Mayor is absent, or signifies his intention of being
absent, from his duties through illness, departure from the city, or other
cause, or his seat is vacated, the Council may appoint a councillor to be
Acting-Mayor. In the absence of the Mayor, the Acting-Mayor shall, during
the period for which he is appointed, have all the powers and duties of the
Mayor; provided, however, that the Acting-Mayor shall not take the place
of the Mayor as Chairman of the Board of Administration unless the
councillor member of the Board is absent from the city or otherwise
unable to act as Chairman of the Board;
b. Section 211. (Director of Finance)
The Director of Finance may, whenever he thinks fit, and shall, whenever
required by the Council so to do, advise the Council on the financial
position of the city or any phase thereof and make recommendations with
respect to the administration, co-ordination, and efficiency of the city's
affairs and the systems under which they are carried on;
c. Section 222 (City Clerk)
He shall have the custody of all by-laws from the time they are
introduced, and, having seen to their proper completion, he shall preserve
and keep the originals thereof; and
4. Further examples of gendered, patriarchal language can be found in Sections
208, 209, 211, 213, 214, 215, 222, 223, 224, 225, 227, 228, 229, 270, 271, 313,
and 560.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to review the Vancouver Charter and recommend
amendments in order to replace gendered and patriarchal language with gender
neutral and egalitarian language.
B. THAT The Mayor on behalf of Council write to the Provincial Minister of Municipal
Affairs (following the 42nd British Columbia general election, and after such time
as a Minister has been appointed) formally requesting gender neutral and
egalitarian language amendments to the Vancouver Charter as in A above.

2. Mandatory Mask Policy for Vancouver Civic Facilities
MOVED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
SECONDED by Councillor De Genova
WHEREAS
1. The COVID-19 pandemic impact has been significant causing many residents to
severely curtail their activities to adhere to physical distancing and health
guidelines. This has and continues to impact people’s daily lives and social and
mental well-being;
2. Municipalities across Canada are adopting new policies requiring masks to be
worn in all civic facilities including city halls, libraries, recreation and culture
facilities. Delta Council unanimously adopted a mask policy to take effect
October 1 as did Richmond at Committee with the final Council vote slated for
October 13;
3. Other public serving agencies have also introduced mandatory face mask
policies including TransLink, BC Transit and BC Ferries and compliance has
been high to date;
4. A recent Simon Fraser University study looking at mask mandates across
Ontario’s 34 public health units over a two-month period this summer found the
policies were associated with a 25 per cent or larger drop in weekly cases. The
study has not yet been peer-reviewed;
5. While the Province has not implemented a mandatory mask policy, the Provincial
Health Officer recommends wearing masks indoors where distancing may be
challenging, or where people may be for extended periods of time, as a good,
preventive measure;
6. With the fall upon us and winter approaching, people will naturally be spending
more time indoors;
7. The City of Vancouver and Vancouver Park Board closed all civic facilities in
March in response to COVID-19 and a civic declared emergency including civic
theatres, libraries, community centres and recreation facilities. These have been
gradually reopening as the City, Vancouver Park Board and Vancouver Public
Library work towards a return of services. These services play a vital role in the
mental, physical and social well-being of residents;
8. The impact of a second significant shutdown in the City (and Province) would
have devastating impacts on small business and residents;
9. The City has a key role to play in leading by example with safe operations
protocols as we continue through COVID-19 and work towards recovery; and
10. The City also has an obligation to support the health and safety of its frontline
staff.

Council Meeting
Minutes, October 20, 2020 31
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council endorse a mandatory mask policy and direct staff to initiate a
mandatory mask policy for the duration of the COVID-19 response and recovery
as soon as possible for Vancouver Civic facilities.
B. THAT the policy include exemptions for children under five, persons with
disabilities and persons with underlying medical conditions that may inhibit them
from being able to wear masks.
C. THAT staff work with non-profit partners and/or utilize senior government
COVID-19 restart funding to provide masks to support persons who may not be
able to afford them.
D. THAT the policy be widely communicated through social media, communications
and on-site signage at relevant facilities to raise awareness and ask the public for
compliance should they wish to utilize civic facilities.
E. THAT subject to approval of the above, this motion be sent to the Vancouver
Park Board, Vancouver Public Library Board, Vancouver Civic Theatres Board
and PNE Board for their consideration and encouragement to adopt a mandatory
mask policy for civic facilities under their respective jurisdictions.
