WHEREAS

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, October 04, 2023 8
1. TransLink and the Mayors’ Council on Regional Transportation unanimously
endorsed the Access for Everyone Plan (also called Transport 2050: 10-Year
Priorities) in 2022 to urgently expand and improve transit throughout Metro
Vancouver to support record-setting population growth, housing affordability, GHG
emission reduction targets and reconciliation;
2. The fastest and most cost-effective contribution the City of Vancouver can make
to the Access for Everyone Plan is to improve the speed and reliability of existing
buses on city roads that the entire region relies on to keep Metro Vancouver
moving;
3. Traffic congestion makes existing bus service slower and less reliable for transit
riders and more expensive for TransLink to operate, costing the region $80 million
annually with over 35% of delays occurring on streets in the City of Vancouver;
4. TransLink has identified several High Congestion/High Ridership Bus Corridors
in the City of Vancouver: on Hastings Street, Kingsway, 49th Avenue and
Granville Street. Transit riders are experiencing significant travel delays, and
TransLink is shouldering increased operating costs on these streets due to traffic
congestion. Residents would benefit from urgent bus speed and reliability
improvements on these routes; and
5. Improving the speed and reliability of existing buses on these High
Congestion/High Ridership Bus Corridors requires reconfiguring roads for
successful implementation. This requires leadership from the City of Vancouver as
the primary administrator of these roads.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT the City of Vancouver supports urgent implementation of bus speed and
reliability improvements along the High Congestion/High Ridership Bus Corridors
of Hastings Street, Kingsway, 49th Avenue and Granville Street.
B. THAT Council direct City of Vancouver staff to work expediently with TransLink to
plan and deliver Bus Speed and Reliability Projects along the entire length of the
High Congestion/High Ridership Bus Corridors of Hasting Street, Kingsway, 49th
Avenue and Granville Street, addressing the locations of greatest delays with a
goal to improve travel times and service reliability for transit users on these
corridors by at least 10% by 2026.
C. THAT Council affirms that the City of Vancouver support for this project will include:
• Support for prioritizing transit, including willingness to reallocate space from
parking or general traffic, changes to property access, bus stop balancing,
turn restrictions, changes to traffic signal timing and coordination, and transit
signal priority;
• Willingness to support these projects with the allocation of internal resources
and in-kind support;

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, October 04, 2023 9
• Appointing a “Faster Buses Council champion,” and a bus speed and
reliability internal staff lead to support the projects through all phases;
• Willingness to expedite processes, permits and approvals, and to co-lead and
support public engagement as necessary.
D. THAT Council request the Mayor, on behalf of Vancouver City Council, to ask the
Mayors’ Council to replace its commitment in the Access for Everyone Plan to
undertake a Major Transit Network planning study on the 41st/49th Avenue Corridor
with a study on the Hastings Street Corridor between downtown Vancouver and the
PNE grounds, to assess its longer-term capacity needs and evaluate potential
Rapid Transit technology alternatives.
E. THAT the City of Vancouver work with TransLink to plan and implement a
RapidBus on Southwest Marine Drive to connect the Canada Line in South
Vancouver and the Expo Line in New Westminster with bus lanes that could also
benefit the other routes along the corridor.

3. Enabling the Rapid Deployment of Additional Childcare Spaces Combined with
Essential Worker Housing in the City of Vancouver
The Committee heard from five speakers who spoke in support of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Klassen
SECONDED by Councillor Dominato
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. Childcare is an essential component of community life in our city;
2. A lack of access to childcare limits economic opportunities for Vancouver families
and has overarching impacts for women in our city;

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, October 04, 2023 10
3. Childcare services support working families, bolster workforces, and help build
healthy complete communities;
4. Notwithstanding the fact childcare is largely the jurisdiction of senior levels of
government, the City of Vancouver has facilitated the creation of over 4,400
childcare spaces, including preschools, since the 1970s;
5. In spite of efforts by all levels of government to make childcare more available, it
is estimated that demand in the city exceeds supply by approximately 15,000
spaces;
6. Multiple Vancouver school properties and public lands could provide space for
structures to support vital community childcare needs;
7. Early childhood educators (ECEs) are an integral part of offering quality childcare
services;
8. ECEs often struggle to find affordable accommodations within the communities
that need them, which is why 45% of ECE employers are losing more staff than
they can hire, and 27% of childcare operators turn away children due to lack of
staff;
9. As demand for childcare spaces far exceeds supply, innovative approaches are
needed to address the lack of available childcare by combining childcare with
attainable housing for ECEs;
10. ECEs are among a class of essential workers who must clear a Vulnerable
Sector Check as a condition of employment, as do teachers, nurses, police
officers, social workers, and care aides; and
11. Prefabricated construction that combines childcare with residences above would
expedite the availability of spaces and housing units by months or even years.
THERFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to engage with the Vancouver School District to identify
available public land where new childcare spaces could be located;
FURTHER THAT priority is given to sites located within Vancouver communities
that have been identified as having the most acute shortages of childcare
spaces, and that non-profit childcare providers be sought out to operate these
facilities on the City’s behalf.
B. THAT Council direct City staff to engage with the Provincial Government and BC
Housing to seek financial support for a pilot program using prefabricated
construction to significantly increase childcare spaces and essential workforce
housing in a timely manner within the City of Vancouver.

4. Modernizing the City’s View Protection Guidelines to Unlock New Housing and
Economic Opportunities
The Committee heard from six speakers who spoke in support of the motion, and two speakers
who spoke in opposition to the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Meiszner
SECONDED by Councillor Bligh
THAT the Committee recommend to Council

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, October 04, 2023 13
WHEREAS
1. In a speech to the Greater Vancouver Board of Trade in January 2023, Mayor
Sim noted that the City’s view cones policy would be reviewed by his
administration, given its impacts on the viability and the potential supply of new
housing and job spaces in the central areas of the city, all of which are well
served by public transit. Mayor Sim also noted that height restrictions due to
building shadowing considerations on public parks, plazas, intersections, and
retail streets would also be reviewed;
2. The downtown peninsula has limited land available for development due to its
geographic boundaries. Although the City seeks to protect Vancouver's
spectacular ocean and mountain views, it also promotes density in the downtown
area to reduce urban sprawl in alignment with sustainability goals;
3. The City of Vancouver View Protection Guidelines, containing 26 protected view
corridors, date from 1989. These protected view corridors have served since that
time to determine the site location and design of buildings;
4. Every view corridor in the city – also called view cones – has a set of elements
that define it. For example, the “View Extent” defines how far and wide a view
corridor is while the “View Origin” establishes the view point that an average
person (i.e., 5'6" tall) would have of the corridor;
5. The City has a Higher Buildings Policy which was adopted by City Council on
May 6, 1997, and subsequently amended on February 1, 2011, November 20,
2013, June 25, 2014, February 13, 2018, and most recently on July 11, 2018. In
accordance with the City’s View Protection Guidelines, higher buildings that do
not impact the protected view corridors are considered;
6. Public benefits are the amenities a city needs such as day care facilities,
affordable housing, parks, cultural facilities, and historic building restoration.
Benefit capacity is a function of additional density – as approved by Council
through a rezoning – from which the City derives public benefits; and
7. The City of Vancouver is currently facing an unprecedented housing crisis,
resulting in soaring house prices, an acute shortage of affordable rental units,
and a significant increase in homelessness, all of which exacerbate social
inequality, result in serious consequences for the well-being and quality of life of
Vancouver residents, and all the while hindering economic growth, attracting
talented individuals, and affecting the city's overall sustainability and liveability.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to initiate a review of the City’s View Protection
Guidelines to determine the amount of additional housing, job space, and public
benefits that could potentially be built on sites currently impacted by view cone
restrictions if various view cones deemed to be obsolete and/or no longer
functionally relevant were to be eliminated, and for staff to report back on

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, October 04, 2023 14
preliminary assumptions and scope of work by Q4 2023, to be followed by a full
report by the end of Q2 2024;
FURTHER THAT the review and report back include a comprehensive list of all
enforced framed and panoramic views and/or view cones in the city.
B. THAT Council direct staff to initiate a review of framed views that can be
eliminated to unlock additional housing and job space over the immediate short
term and report back by Q4 2023;
FURTHER THAT staff’s report back in Q4 2023 will specifically seek Council’s
endorsement of the specific framed views to be eliminated, prior to bringing
forward the necessary bylaw changes.

7. The City of Vancouver is currently facing an unprecedented housing crisis,
resulting in soaring house prices, an acute shortage of affordable rental units,
and a significant increase in homelessness, all of which exacerbate social
inequality, result in serious consequences for the well-being and quality of life of
Vancouver residents, and all the while hindering economic growth, attracting
talented individuals, and affecting the city's overall sustainability and liveability.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to initiate a review of the City’s View Protection
Guidelines to determine the amount of additional housing, job space, hotel space
and public benefits, that could potentially be built on sites currently impacted by
view cone restrictions if various view cones deemed to be obsolete and/or no
longer functionally relevant were potentially removed from the view protection
guidelines, and for staff to report back on preliminary assumptions and scope of
work by Q4 2023, to be followed by a full report by the end of Q2 2024;
FURTHER THAT the review and report back include a comprehensive list of all
enforced framed and panoramic views and/or view cones in the city.
B. THAT Council direct staff to conduct a review of framed views with the intent of
reviewing, refining and/or considering for removal from the view protection
guidelines with clear criteria to unlock additional housing and job space over the
immediate short term while highlighting the view cones that should be retained
for the public benefit of protecting Vancouver’s spectacular mountain and ocean
views and report back by Q2 2024;
FURTHER THAT staff’s report back in Q4 2023 will specifically seek Council’s
endorsement of the specific and well-considered framed views be adjusted or
removed, prior to bringing forward the necessary bylaw changes.
5. Enabling Purpose-Built Affordable Student Housing
The Committee heard from two speakers who spoke in support of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Dominato
SECONDED by Councillor Klassen
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. Vancouver is a well-regarded academic hub with numerous world-renowned
accredited educational institutions that attract thousands of students every year.
These students come from diverse backgrounds and cultures seeking quality
education and personal and professional growth;
2. Vancouver’s world-class education institutions contribute greatly to the city’s
growth, diversity, and prosperity;

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, October 04, 2023 17
3. Vancouver’s lack of affordable student housing options is known to be a
significant barrier for students pursuing higher education. It often leads to
financial stress that burdens students and hampers their academic pursuits.
Ultimately, it hinders our city’s potential for cultivating and attracting talent and
fostering innovation;
4. At present, the City of Vancouver does not have a policy framework to enable
purpose-built, affordable student housing forms;
5. The ability to enable and actively promote the development of purpose-built
affordable student housing projects is within the land use powers of the City of
Vancouver granted under the Vancouver Charter: housing that would cater to the
specific needs of students by offering cost-effective accommodations while
ensuring a safe and inclusive environment for learning and personal growth;
6. Housing Vancouver is the City’s 10-year housing strategy. It seeks to reduce
Vancouver’s housing affordability gap and to provide a strong foundation for the
future of the city. It guides all policy decisions related to housing;1
7. Purpose-built student housing on and off campus has proven to be an affordable
option for many academic institutions such as University of British Columbia,
Simon Fraser University, and University of Victoria. Purpose-built student housing
enhances the overall academic experience while fostering a sense of community
and positively impacting student retention and success rates. Additionally, it will
help to reduce existing pressures on the general Vancouver housing market; and
8. Enabling purpose-built affordable student housing in Vancouver is not only an
investment in the future of our city, it is also a commitment to social equity and
educational progress. By enabling the construction of previously untapped forms
of student housing we are paving the way for a thriving, inclusive, and dynamic
student community that contributes significantly to our city’s growth and
prosperity in ways that bolster its reputation as a innovative, knowledge-driven
city.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to report back with policy
options for enabling more purpose-built student housing projects, including but not
limited to, a range of policy levers such as housing covenants and affiliations with public
or accredited post-secondary institutions;
FURTHER THAT Council direct staff to provide an update as part of the Housing
Targets Refresh/3 Year Action Plan in Q2 2024.
1 The Housing Vancouver strategy is intended to provide a strong foundation for the
future for the city, one where neighbourhoods are full of families, young people can
afford to buy a home, and people of all incomes and backgrounds can participate in their
communities. https://vancouver.ca/people-programs/housing-policies.aspx
