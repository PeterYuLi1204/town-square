FINAL MOTION AS APPROVED
WHEREAS
1. The COVID-19 pandemic has inflicted significant negative economic impacts with
many Vancouver residents being laid off or experiencing wage and salary

2. Lost operating revenues have already forced the City of Vancouver to lay off
1500 highly-valued workers;
3. Additional revenue losses or property tax defaults could bring additional

2. Ensuring All Vancouver Residents Can Comply with Public Health Guidance
MOVED by Councillor Swanson
SECONDED by Councillor Boyle
WHEREAS
1. COVID-19 is an unprecedented public health emergency;
2. Dr. Bonnie Henry, the Provincial Health Officer, has directed British Columbians
to practice physical distancing and to “stay at home as much as possible” in
order to slow the spread of COVID-19;
3. The City’s 2019 Homeless Count identified 2,223 residents as homeless, and
these residents will likely be unable to follow Provincial health directives without
additional assistance because they have no homes;
4. Mayor Kennedy Stewart has called upon the Provincial and Federal governments
to provide “additional shelter capacity/temporary housing for up to 3,000 people
currently unable to self-isolate”;
5. The Provincial Government and Provincial agencies, including BC Housing and
Emergency Management BC, have significantly more flexibility in obtaining
resources and, therefore, are better positioned than the City to address the
housing needs of City residents during the COVID-19 crisis;

Council Meeting
Minutes, April 28, 2020 27
6. To date, the Provincial Government and Provincial agencies have not secured
enough housing to allow for Vancouver’s homeless population to practice
appropriate physical distancing and self-isolation;
7. There have been numerous COVID-19 outbreaks in congregate settings like
prisons and long term care facilities;
8. Shelters are congregate settings where people have even less chance to self-
isolate than people in prisons and nursing homes because they do not have
private rooms or even cells with toilets;
9. There have been COVID-19 outbreaks in shelters in the US with large numbers
of people testing positive even when they have few if any symptoms;
10. The continued use of shelters as spaces for people who are homeless increases
risk of COVID-19 transmission among people who are and are not homeless;
11. Western Aboriginal Harm Reduction has a list of 92 people living in Oppenheimer
Park who want to move indoors; and
12. The BC Hotel Association estimates that 60 per cent of hotels in British Columbia
have closed due to the COVID-19 crisis, indicating that there are enough empty
rooms to address the isolation needs of City of Vancouver residents.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council urge the Province of British Columbia to acquire hotel rooms as
soon as possible to offer to all unhoused people in Vancouver so they have
the same opportunity for self-isolation as people with homes.
B. THAT, if the Province is unwilling to take this action, the City itself will acquire
hotel rooms for unhoused people and work with BC Housing and Coastal Health
to provide supports so unhoused people have the same opportunity for self-
isolation as people with homes.

4. Strengthening Representative Democratic Practices in the City of Vancouver
MOVED by Councillor Hardwick
SECONDED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
WHEREAS
1. In democratic theory, representatives are elected to represent the people within
jurisdictional boundaries. So, representatives must know what their constituents
think in order to best represent the ‘will of the people’;
2. Under the laws and traditions of Canada, the fundamental principles of
representative democracy apply to the City of Vancouver, its elected Council,
and the various legislative processes conducted by Council and the City on
behalf of the city’s constituents and within the City’s jurisdictional and physical
boundaries;
3. Municipal councils in British Columbia typically have full discretion to set policies,
adopt bylaws, and establish direction for their communities, in accordance with
legislation and other legal rules, and they do so within the established principles
and traditions of representative democracy and consistent with the Canadian
democratic tradition;1
4. The Vancouver Charter lays out the boundaries of the city, as well as the
electoral process by which our representatives are elected, and responsibilities to
the inhabitants of the City.
1
The City of Vancouver, as with other municipalities in British Columbia, is empowered to control land use and
development within the city through a variety of processes and tools, and is also responsible for providing essential
municipal infrastructure and services including drinking water, roads, fire protection, and sewage collection and
treatment.

Council Meeting
Minutes, April 28, 2020 29
5. In a representative democracy, all eligible citizens have the right to participate,
either directly or indirectly, in making the decisions that affect them, most
commonly by voting in an election and/or by making their views known to their
elected officials on issues of importance to them and their community, for
example, at Public Hearings of Council;2
6. In order to ensure that constituent and community feedback is fully, fairly, and
transparently articulated and considered, it is incumbent in a representative
democracy to ensure that the will of the people, as expressed by its constituents
through the various feedback mechanisms and processes in place, is accurately
and fairly presented;
7. To be effective stewards of the City and best represent constituents, members of
a City Council must receive and consider feedback representing a wide range of
views obtained through a variety of means and processes. Specifically:
● in person (e.g. at public hearings and from delegations to Council)
● on paper (e.g. letters, petitions)
● online (e.g. emails, online petitions, social media)
8. Public Hearings are a quasi-judicial process of Council where, at the start of a
public hearing, the City Clerk reads a summary of the application under
consideration along with a summary of correspondence received. For example,
the Clerk’s opening statement variously takes the form of, “The following
correspondence has been received since referral to public hearing and prior to
the close of the speakers list and receipt of public comments: x pieces of
correspondence in support and x pieces of correspondence in opposition. This
represents all correspondence up to 5:00 PM today.”;
9. The summary of correspondence presented at public hearings and for other
Council processes is intended to quantify and convey the level support or
opposition to a matter under consideration. Council is reliant on the quality and
2
Sections 22 through 24 of the Vancouver Charter, under Division 5 (Electors), specifies the eligibility criteria for
“resident electors” (i.e., those who live in the city) and “non-resident property electors” (i.e., the registered owner of
real property in the city) to vote in a City of Vancouver election, all of whom must be, among other requirements and
restrictions, 18 years of age or older on the day of registration or on the general voting day for the election, a
Canadian citizen, and a resident of British Columbia for at least 6 months immediately before the day of registration
or on the general voting day for the election.
Section 38 of the Vancouver Charter under Division 5 (Qualifications for Office) lays out the requirements that must
be met for holding office on Council or Park Board and states, among other criteria, that the person “must be an
individual who is, or who will be on general voting day for the election, 18 years of age or older,” a Canadian citizen,
and “must have been a resident of British Columbia, as determined in accordance with section 25 [of the Charter], for
at least 6 months immediately before the relevant time.”

Council Meeting
Minutes, April 28, 2020 30
reliability of the summary information to ensure that the decision making process
is sound and sufficiently representative in its scope;
10. Those persons wishing to address Vancouver City Council on a matter, either as
a delegation to Council or at a Public Hearing, including through written
correspondence, are currently not required to indicate or state where they live in
the city, what their home address may be, or whether they may in fact reside in
another municipality altogether;
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT individuals providing public feedback related to
items of Council meetings, Standing Committees, and Public Hearings be requested to
state the following:
● Their full name;
● Whether they are a resident of the City of Vancouver, or are non-resident, or if
they are homeless; and
FURTHER THAT unregistered migrant and refugee residents are exempt from this
policy.
