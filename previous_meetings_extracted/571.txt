1. Streamlining Rental Around Local Shopping Areas – Amendments to the C-2,
C-2B, C-2C and C-2C1 Zones and Creation of New Rental Zones for Use in Future
Rezoning Applications in Surrounding Low Density Areas Under the Secured
Rental Policy
An application by the General Manager of Planning, Urban Design and Sustainability was
considered as follows:

Public Hearing
Minutes, November 2, 4, and 9, 2021 2
Summary: For Council’s consideration:
• Amendments to the Zoning and Development By-law for C-2, C-2B, C-2C
and C-2C1 district schedules to allow new secured rental buildings up to six
storeys outside of areas subject to recent and ongoing community planning
programs and other minor changes to the C-2 zones that will apply city-wide.
• Amendments to the Zoning and Development By-law to introduce three new
standard rental district schedules (RR-1; RR-2A, RR-2B and RR-2C; and RR-
3A and RR-3B) to enable the consideration of future rezoning applications
under the Secured Rental Policy. No properties are proposed to be rezoned
to a new rental (RR) district schedule at this time. Each future rezoning
application considered under the Secured Rental Policy would require a
decision by City Council following a separate Public Hearing.
• Amendments to C-2 design guidelines, new design guidelines for secured
rental projects in C-2 and RR zones, and consequential amendments to the
Sign By-law, Noise Control By-law, Parking By-law and Subdivision By-law.
• Amendments to the Secured Rental Policy (2019) to reflect the proposed
zoning changes and to update the locational criteria that will be used to
determine eligibility for future rental rezoning applications.
The General Manager of Planning, Urban Design and Sustainability recommended approval
subject to conditions set out in the summary and recommendation of the Public Hearing
agenda.
