THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT the City of Vancouver Renters’ Advisory Committee recommend and request
that the Mayor and Council of the City of Vancouver amend, improve, and adopt the
Vancouver Plan, subject to the following:

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, July 6 and 22, 2022 16
• Inclusion of AAA Bike Lane & Active Transportation Infrastructure
on all Arterials and Greenways, because Renters are most likely
to not have alternative modes of transportation such as personal
vehicles;
• Introduction of Parking Maximums City-wide;
• Allowing Low Rise Construction (up to 6 Stories), as of right,
everywhere in the city;
• Allow Mid Rise Construction (up to 12 Stories) for Affordable and
Supportive Housing, as of right, everywhere in the city;
• Allowing Corner Stores and mixed Commercial Uses across more
areas of the City;
• Recommending a narrowing of lot width down to 16 feet, including
exterior walls, to facilitate construction of Fee Simple Row
Houses, and Stacked Townhouses of up to 6 stories on Single
Family Lots, as of right;
• Allowing Fee Simple Row Houses, Stacked Townhouses, and Co-
Op Housing, as of right, everywhere in the city;
• Including as of right land use approvals, everywhere in the City,
for proposals that meet form and character guidelines of a “21st
Century Vancouver Special”;
• Introducing policy to encourage the densification of High Streets
off Arterials by focusing density one lot back across the laneways
in order to move density away from noisy and polluted
transportation corridors;
• Amend policy 1.6.1 to read: “Increase the supply of new purpose
built market and below market rental housing and co-op housing
through supportive land use policy and zoning, financial
incentives, additional height and density, and streamlined hearing
and approval processes;
• Expanding Broadway Plan Renter Protections including Right of
Return and Right of First Refusal in the Vancouver Plan;
• Expanding 25% 2 bedroom plus unit requirement and 10% 3
bedroom plus unit requirement for all Multiplexes over 6 units;
• Basing housing planning in the Vancouver Plan on the Housing
Needs Report for the City of Vancouver.
B. FURTHER THAT the City of Vancouver Renters’ Advisory Committee
recommend and request that Mayor and Council direct staff to perform
financial feasibility testing on vacancy control to determine its impact on
rental supply.
O. THAT Council direct staff to explore and report back on the development of a
heritage values map of the City’s neighbourhoods that will serve as a basis for a
Historic Context Statement of the Vancouver Plan to ensure the city’s heritage,
both tangible and intangible, is recognized, rejuvenated, and sustained.

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, July 6 and 22, 2022 17
P. THAT, in order to achieve our Climate Emergency Action Plan goals, which are
currently not on track to reduce Vancouver’s Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions
by 50% by 2030 and become a net zero carbon city by 2050, Council direct staff
to explore and report back to Council on accelerated and additional measures in
the Vancouver Plan’s Implementation and Phasing Plan that most deeply reduce
carbon emissions including expanding active transportation and transit
infrastructure, reallocating a minimum of 11% of streets for non-car
neighbourhood amenities, zoning for a range of higher density affordable
housing options with access to transit, requiring low carbon construction
materials, restoring natural ecosystems, increasing green space and the city-
wide tree canopy , and developing walkable, complete neighbourhoods city-wide.
Q. THAT Council direct Staff to explore a Pre-emptive Right By-law (aka Right of
First Refusal By-Law) which gives the municipality the priority to purchase
buildings or lands to provide more affordable housing choices equitably
distributed throughout the city, and report back with opportunities and challenges
related to applying this approach to Vancouver;
FURTHER THAT Staff consider the Pre-emptive Right By-law application and
implementation in other cities; including but not limited to Montreal.
R. THAT Council instruct Staff to consider approaches to improving livability in multi-
family housing, including new requirements for minimum unit sizes, and updates
to the High Density Housing for Families and Children Guidelines; and report
back with strategies and implications to Council as an early action through the
implementation of the Vancouver Plan.
The Committee adjourned on July 22, 2022 at 2:29 pm
