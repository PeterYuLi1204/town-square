Agendas and Reports
MOVED by Councillor Swanson
WHEREAS
1. Council members often wish they had more time to study, evaluate and research
responses to staff reports that require Council decisions;
2. Members of the public frequently complain that they lack sufficient time to read
staff reports, consult with others in the community to develop a response and
notify other interested parties who might want to address council on the issue;
3. Most members of the public are alerted that Council is to consider an item of
interest to them by media reports in newspapers, radio and TV which are not
published until Thursday or Friday, and social media posts or emails from
knowledgeable sources are often not circulated until the weekend;

Council Meeting
Minutes, November 2, 2021 11
4. Tight timelines create an advantage for organizations with paid staff, who are
then disproportionately represented in public responses to Council items; and
5. Management is responsible for organizing and allocating the workload for City
employees that respects labour laws and contract requirements.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct the City of Vancouver
management to organize staff and City resources to ensure that Council members and

Prior to Councillor Swanson introducing the motion and receiving a seconder, Councillor
Kirby-Yung rose on a point of order to ask for a ruling from the Chair as to whether the motion
was in order, under Procedure By-law section 8.7, as it was similar to a motion which was put
and failed at the September 21, 2021, meeting.
Following a brief recess, the Mayor ruled the motion Out of Order due to the previous vote on
the matter. The Mayor also noted the motion could be brought back through rescinding the
September 21, 2021, motion.

3. Plant-Based Purchasing Savings for City and Climate
MOVED by Councillor Fry
SECONDED by Councillor Boyle
WHEREAS
1. Anthropogenic climate change is forcing governments and systems to consider
how human behaviour and consumption can be modified in order to help meet
the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2018 target to limit
global warming to 1.5 °C;
2. The IPCC has advised that a plant-based diet can help flight climate change,
specifically as the West's high consumption of meat and dairy produce is fuelling
global warming;
Livestock farming (the management and breeding of domestic, livestock, or farm
animals for the purpose of obtaining their meat and products) is estimated to take
up around 30% of the earth’s surface and contribute 18% of all global
greenhouse gas emissions;

Council Meeting
Minutes, November 2, 2021 12
3. The City of Vancouver declared a Climate Emergency in January 2019, and on
November 17, 2020, Council approved the Climate Emergency Action Plan
(CEAP). The Big Moves articulated in the Plan focus on zero emissions in
transportation, heating systems, and construction;
The CEAP Report acknowledges one main lever to reduce food system
emissions is adopting diets low in animal products (particularly beef, pork and
dairy) and working towards a low-carbon food system for Vancouver will require:
a. Identifying potential changes to City procurement and practices through
the new Green Operations Plan; and
b. Actions to support urban agriculture as one means of increasing
opportunities for sustainable food production and the harvesting and
availability of plant-based foods;
4. The City of Vancouver’s Healthy City Strategy articulates the goal of Feeding
Ourselves Well: through a healthy, just, and sustainable food system;
5. Plant-based diets are increasingly seen as a healthier option by Canadians, as
excessive meat consumption has been shown to increase saturated fat intake
and is linked to obesity and a variety of diseases;
6. Plant-based diets are driving profits and growth in the grocery and food services
industry 1 and creating a variety of local business success stories. Vancouver is
consistently named as a global plant-based foodie capital;2
7. Vancouver’s status as an economic centre for plant-based products is growing.
Setting targets for plant-based options in the City’s food procurement can send a
powerful signal to the food production and processing industries of further growth
potential;
8. The Vancouver Humane Society (VHS) report Increasing Plant-Based
Purchasing at the Municipal Level 3 is urging the City of Vancouver to incorporate
meat-reduction efforts into the City’s greater ecological objectives.
In the report, VHS has conducted an analysis of the City of Vancouver’s current
food purchasing activities including: Vancouver Civic Theatres concessions, City
event catering contracts, low-cost meal programs, Parks Board concession
services and golf course food service, and the Vancouver School Board’s
Food4School program;
9. The Vancouver Humane Society analysis has proposed three alternative City of
Vancouver procurement/replacement options for a 20% reduction in animal-
based products. Implementing just one of these options would save up to
$99,000 in procurement costs, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more
than 500 tonnes. Additionally, the replacement of 20% animal-based options with
plant-based options is projected to increase sales revenues by 14% ($400,000)
and save the equivalent of nearly 400 farmed animals a year.

Council Meeting
Minutes, November 2, 2021 13
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council declare that plant-based procurement can result in cost and
budget efficiencies, help to promote healthier choices for Vancouverites, support
local plant-based businesses, meet demonstrated food and dining trends, and
respond to the Climate Emergency.
B. THAT Council direct staff to report back with policy on how a partial shift to plant-
based procurement can save the City on costs and greenhouse gas emissions,
and consider one or all of the Vancouver Humane Society proposed policy
change options, including:
a. a 20% reduction in all animal-based products;
b. a 20% reduction in the most cost-intensive animal-based products; or
c. a 20% reduction in the most carbon-intensive animal-based products.
C. THAT Council direct staff to share the report back with Vancouver Board of Parks
and Recreation, Vancouver Economic Commission, and Vancouver School
Board for information.
