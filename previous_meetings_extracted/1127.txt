WHEREAS
1. The City of Vancouver is the owner of all the streets and lanes lying within
the limits of the City of Vancouver;
2. A building for market rental purposes has been approved by the City and
constructed on Lot 349 False Creek Plan EPP26177 (“Lot 349”) for market
rental purposes (the “Building”);

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, Tuesday, September 19, 2017 17
3. The Building includes a five storey underground parking structure within a
volumetric portion of Georgia Street abutting Lot 349 (the “Volumetric
Portion”);
4. On March 12, 2013 Council resolved that the Volumetric Portion be closed,
stopped-up and leased to the owner of Lot 349 for 99 years;
5. The owner of Lot 349 currently leases the Volumetric Portion from the City;
6. The Volumetric Portion is defined on the Explanatory Plan registered in the
Land Title Office as Plan EPP27876 and the lease is registered in the Land
Title Office as CA3096875;
7. During the development application process the City requested the owner
to revise the original design of the underground parking structure to include
an additional exiting stairway in order to meet the Vancouver Building By-
Law, to add an elevator to provide adequate access to bicycle rooms on
various levels of the parkade, and to increase the size of the easterly exit
stairs to accommodate integration with the East Tower and Rogers Arena
(the “Additional Structures”);
8. The Additional Structures have now been surveyed and they are found to be
beyond the boundaries of the Volumetric Portion and therefore it is
necessary to stop-up and lease additional volumetric portions to the owner
(the “Additional Volumetric Portions”);
9. The Additional Volumetric Portions are shown on Plan EPP73737 attached
hereto;
10. The Additional Volumetric Portions consist of a portion of Georgia Street for
which title was raised and registered currently as PID: 029-060-141; That
Part of False Creek Shown on Plan EPP27872.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT all that volumetric portion of Georgia Street
included within heavy bold outline and illustrated isometrically on Plan EPP73737
prepared by Jesse Morin, B.C.L.S., completed on the 4th day of September, 2017,
be closed, stopped-up and leased to the owner of abutting Lot 349 False Creek
Plan EPP26177. The lease arrangements to be to the satisfaction of the General
Manager of Engineering Services and the Director of Legal Services.

Minutes, Tuesday, September 19, 2017 20
2. Non-Market Housing Projects Dataset
MOVED by Councillor Affleck
SECONDED by Councillor De Genova
WHEREAS
1. Vancouver City Council is committed to making City information freely
available – while balancing privacy rights – to ensure transparency,
accountability, and good governance;
2. The City’s Open Data catalogue provides free and open access to over 145 City
datasets, and new datasets are added regularly;
3. The available Open Data datasets are diverse and include – among others –
employee remuneration and expenses (over $75,000/year), 3-1-1 contact
centre metrics, locations of installed bike racks on City property, parking ticket
records data, locations and attributes of public washrooms on city streets and
in public parks (in CSV, XLS, and KML formats), individual Council member
voting records for Regular Council, Special Council, Standing Committee, and
Public Hearing meetings, as well as a dataset that inventories street trees in
the city;
4. City of Vancouver housing staff keep a complete inventory of non-market
housing projects – both the buildings owned by the City and the buildings
provided by other agencies – which allows Vancouver residents who are unable
to pay market-level rents to locate social and co-op housing and easily find any
facility (see: http://vancouver.ca/people-programs/find-subsidized-and-co-op-
rental-housing.aspx);
5. The non-market housing inventory information kept by City of Vancouver
housing staff includes many details about each building, including: exact street
address, number of units, types of units available (families, seniors, singles,
etc.), a photo, name of the building's sponsor, original occupancy date, and
links to related City of Vancouver documents such as lease agreements,
development permits, and rezoning approvals;
6. Social housing units typically originate from two types of projects: mixed
market/social housing projects, and 100% social housing projects;
7. Due to the nature of major project rezoning approvals, which are typically
large, phased developments taking 10 or 15 years to build out, public benefit
contributions such as social and/or non-market housing units may take a
decade or more before they are available for occupancy;
8. In response to Vancouver’s housing crisis, the City of Vancouver is re-setting its
Housing and Homelessness Strategy to better meet the needs of residents (see:
Housing Vancouver Strategy: http://vancouver.ca/people-programs/housing-
vancouver-strategy.aspx and “The Big Conversation” Discussion Guide: The
Future of Housing in Vancouver, June 17, 2017
http://vancouver.ca/files/cov/housing-vancouver-discussion-guide.pdf);

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, Tuesday, September 19, 2017 21
9. Access to clear, easily referenced, transparent data relating to the City’s
non-market and social housing inventory (current and planned inventory) is
crucial to any discussion of housing and homelessness in the City of Vancouver
and is in accord with governance best practices.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Vancouver City Council direct staff to compile a
comprehensive non-market housing / social housing dataset, to be made available in
basic CSV/XLS formats that can be opened by many applications including Excel and
other spreadsheet applications, and for this dataset to be made available on the City
of Vancouver Open Data Catalogue, with information fields to include (but not limited
to) the following:
• Project name
• Exact street address
• Status (i.e., completed and occupied, under construction, approved)
• Original occupancy date
• Number of units
• Types of units (i.e., Standard, Accessible, Adaptable, Supportive, etc.)
• Number of units by bedroom (i.e., Room, Studio, 1-Bed, 2-Bed, 3-Bed, 4-Bed)
• Housing focus (i.e., families, seniors, singles, etc.)
• Ownership (i.e., City-owned or privately-owned)
• Name of the building's sponsoring agency
• Links to related City of Vancouver documents and reports such as lease
agreements, development permits, and rezoning approvals
• Other explanatory comments
BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED THAT the non-market housing in this Dataset be clearly
categorized as either proposed, approved, under construction, or occupied (as the
case may be) to account for non-market housing that is planned and/or approved,
housing that is under construction, and housing that is already built and occupied.

REFERRAL MOVED by Councillor Reimer
SECONDED by Councillor Stevenson
THAT Council refer this motion to staff in order for staff to bring a recommendation

providing the information requested in an open data format with the least amount of
duplication.

Minutes, Tuesday, September 19, 2017 22
NEW BUSINESS
1. 2018 Budget Enhancements Pertaining to Littering and Residents’ Safety
MOVER: Councillor Affleck
SECONDER: Councillor De Genova
WHEREAS
1. The mission of the Vancouver Board of Parks and Recreation is to provide,
preserve, and advocate for parks and recreation services to benefit all people,
communities, and the environment;
2. The Vancouver Board of Parks and Recreation (Park Board) is established under
the Vancouver Charter and has possession, jurisdiction and control of all areas
designated as permanent public parks of the City;
3. Section 496 of the Vancouver Charter states that “Every warden, lifeguard,
patrolman, or watchman employed in the parks by the Board shall, while in the
performance of his duties within the parks, be ex officio possessed of all the
powers and authority of a police constable”;
4. In May 2000, The Vancouver Board of Parks and Recreation established the
Park Ranger program in response to a) growing competition for space and the
increased intensity of activity in many public spaces in the downtown, and
b) an expectation on the part of park users that competing interests be
moderated and balanced as part of park stewardship;
5. Since 2000, the Park Ranger program has grown and expanded in scope and
responsibilities: for example, to include by-law enforcement for the ban on
smoking in Vancouver parks as introduced in September 2010;
6. In recent years, the Park Board and its budget have experienced significant
challenges related to drug use and garbage in various Downtown parks, notably
Andy Livingstone Park, Emery Barnes Park, and Stanley Park, and increasingly
at Hinge Park, Creekside Park, and others;
7. Used syringes, in particular, represent an ongoing safety risk in a number of
Vancouver parks, especially for children, and Park Board Commissioners and
Staff, as well as members of Council, have received numerous expressions of
concern from parents and others who frequent Vancouver parks;
8. An estimated 28,000 person-hours were allocated to Park Ranger services in the
2017 Park Board budget, which is the equivalent of 22 FTE Park Ranger
positions to patrol 240 Vancouver parks;
9. Vancouver parks are open from 6:00 A.M. to 10:00 P.M. daily, and often
accessed and used 24 hours a day, while Park Rangers are typically not on duty
after 8:00 P.M., which places the burden and cost of by-law enforcement in
City parks on the Vancouver Police Department (VPD) during the overnight
hours;

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, Tuesday, September 19, 2017 23
10. The existing Park Board budget for Park Rangers and park maintenance is
inadequate to address the significant challenges related to drug use and
littering in various parks.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Vancouver City Council direct staff to include, on a priority basis as part
of the 2018 Operating Budget process, additional funding for the Vancouver
Board of Parks and Recreation to enable 24-hour-a-day Park Ranger patrols at
all Vancouver parks impacted by the significant challenges of drug use and
littering, as well as additional funding to maintain the cleanliness and safety of
impacted Vancouver parks on an ongoing basis.
B. THAT Vancouver City Council direct City staff to continue to liaise with their
Park Board staff counterparts to explore ways in which Park Board can assist in
efforts to locate appropriate housing and supports for those struggling with
mental health and addiction challenges.

Councillor Jang called notice on this motion under section 10.3(d) of the Procedure By-law.

ENQUIRIES AND OTHER MATTERS
1. Bid for Amazon Headquarters
Councillor Carr requested information on the bid for the proposed Amazon Headquarters,
including how and when Council would be informed of any bids in Vancouver, and the analysis
around the impacts of such a development on housing and affordability, brick and mortar
stores, small businesses, and transportation.
The Mayor and the City Manager responded noting that the Vancouver Economic Commission
(VEC) is leading the bid as this currently sits within their work and that the VEC is working
with regional stakeholders. The City Manager also noted that the VEC is preparing a memo
which should explain most of these enquiries, and that he would ensure Council receives a
copy of the memo.

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, Tuesday, September 19, 2017 24
2. False Creek Flats Transit Station
Councillor Reimer noted that the Great Northern Way campus was approved prior to knowing
what TransLink’s plans for routing the Millennium Line Extension were. Now that these plans
are known, they could have a significant impact on 525 Great Northern Way. She requested
information on how and when TransLink came to their decision, and what options are
available for retaining the existing building.
3. By-election 2018
Councillor Affleck requested information regarding voter outreach especially the impact of no
voter cards, the type of identification required to vote, and when results of the election
would be available. The Chief Electoral Officer responded, noting that flyers will be
distributed to all households in Vancouver containing information on how, when and where to
vote, and the results would be available shortly after the close of the voting places on
election day.
