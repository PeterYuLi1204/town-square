2. Catalysing Planning for the Future of Central Waterfront District
MOVED by Councillor Fry
SECONDED by Councillor De Genova
WHEREAS
1. Vancouver’s Central Waterfront is a natural focal point for the city: with
commanding views of the ocean and mountains; where the central business

Council Meeting
Minutes, April 26, 2022 19
district and historic old city meet; a gateway to Vancouver for hundreds of
thousands of cruise ships and convention centre tourists; and the busiest
transportation hub in the region with the convergence of air, marine and rail
transportation alongside over 18 million public transit passengers a year
travelling by SeaBus, Skytrain, and the West Coast Express;
2. From its incarnation as the Pacific terminus for the CPR transcontinental railway
in the early twentieth century, the Central Waterfront district has been
contemplated for massive urban renewal and planning around transportation by
sea and by rail. The 1960s Project 200 waterfront freeway plan contemplated an
automobile-oriented approach that was ultimately supplanted with the
introduction of the SeaBus in the 1970s; with further transformational change in
1986 and the introduction of the SkyTrain Expo line and Canada Place, followed
by the Helijet and seaplane terminals, the West Coast Express, and the Canada
Line in later decades;
3. Today, the Central Waterfront planning area involves a number of landowners
and interests including the Vancouver Fraser Port Authority (Port of Vancouver),
TransLink, PavCo/Vancouver Convention Centre, CP Rail, GHD Equity Holdings,
Cadillac-Fairview, and across all levels of government including the Musqueam,
Squamish and Tsleil-Waututh host nations, Federal government, Provincial
government, Board of Parks and Recreations, and City of Vancouver;
4. In 1979, the City of Vancouver approved the Central Waterfront Official
Development Plan.1 In reviewing stakeholder positions both port and rail
functions indicated an interest in co-existing and co-operating with the City’s
objectives, summarized thus:
“The basic objectives of the City in planning the Central Waterfront are to make
the area more accessible and enjoyable to the people of Vancouver while
maintaining a viable port operation and, to ensure future development of the area
is compatible with the adjacent Downtown and Gastown. The introduction of
urban uses such as commercial, recreational and light industrial in the Central
Waterfront, integrated with essential port and rail operations would be most
appropriate to achieve these objectives.”
5. In July 2009, Council endorsed the Central Waterfront Hub Framework 2 to
supplement existing policy and guide future planning for the area, with direction
for staff to develop a strategy for seeking the support and involvement of senior
levels of government, area landowners, and other stakeholders for
implementation of the Waterfront Hub framework;
6. In October 2017, Council approved the City Core 2050 and Related Planning
Programs 3 report, which directed a Central Waterfront Review to focus on the
iconic northern shore of Vancouver’s downtown waterfront, one of the most
diverse and multi-modal transportation nodes in the world. Building on the
Central Waterfront Hub Framework (2009) and exploring the broader waterfront
interface with the Port Lands and Convention Centre activities, working together
with Port of Vancouver and TransLink, on a work plan to:

Council Meeting
Minutes, April 26, 2022 20
a. Clarify the extent of waterfront lands to be included in the review;
b. Identify optimum infrastructure to service changing demands;
c. Explore ways to better integrate transit services and increase capacity to
meet growing needs;
d. Explore ways to transform the hub into a world-class transportation
interchange and a dynamic extension of the downtown to the waterfront;
and
e. Advance a framework for a possible larger master plan process (future
phase);
7. July 2019, Council approved Expanding Downtown Eastside Greenspace and
Waterfront Access 4, which included staff direction to work with the Port, Park
Board, host nations, and urban indigenous communities to identify planning and
partnership opportunities, including the development and construction of an
indigenous-focused healing, wellness and/or cultural centre at CRAB Park, as
part of an overall goal to expand waterfront access;
8. To date, there remains confusion and uncertainty about the future of the Central
Waterfront with a number of incompatible and competing aspirations for the area.
Recent public forums with Simon Fraser University, and Vancouver City Planning
Commission led by the Downtown Waterfront Working Group (DWWG) have
engaged and inspired stakeholders, community members and other interested
parties to re-imagine the future of the Central Waterfront District; 5
9. A February 4, 2022, memo from the General Manager, Planning, Urban Design
and Sustainability outlined work between City of Vancouver and Vancouver
Fraser Port Authority since a 2018 Letter of Intent to work together on a planning
framework for the Central Waterfront. The first phase of this work has so far
identified common goals, opportunities, and necessary infrastructure
improvements – and engaged key stakeholders (landowners and agencies)
including CP Rail, GHD Equity Holdings, Cadillac-Fairview, PavCo and
TransLink.
The memo concludes with acknowledgement that commencement of a
comprehensive planning program for the Central Waterfront is not currently
funded or resourced within the Planning and Engineering departments’ 2022
work programs but, “the City is well-placed to launch a full program in 2023,
pending Council direction to do so”;
10. The City of Vancouver does not have jurisdiction over the entire Central
Waterfront District, however, the City is uniquely empowered with the authority
and mandate to convene, collaborate, and envision complex land use decisions
and development proposals with senior governments, landowners, and
stakeholders as part of comprehensive area planning. The Central Waterfront
presents an opportunity for world class city-building and benefits to
Vancouverites and visitors for generations to come; and

Council Meeting
Minutes, April 26, 2022 21
11. Advancing plans for the Central Waterfront District serves many city goals related
to liveability that include: increasing public spaces, enhancing pedestrian and
cycling infrastructure, climate change resilience, reconciliation, connecting East
Vancouver waterfront, and supporting tourism and the local economy.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council re-affirms the intention to embark on planned regeneration and
renewal of the Central Waterfront in collaboration with federal and provincial
levels of government, the three host nations, private and community sectors;
FURTHER THAT this intention and planning inform future development
proposals for the Central Waterfront District.
B. THAT Council direct staff to re-engage partners, stakeholders, and the public
with the intent to reinvigorate a comprehensive plan for the Central Waterfront
District;
FURTHER THAT Council direct staff to report back with necessary budget and
resourcing to commence a comprehensive planning program for the Central
Waterfront District in the 2023 budget.

3. Increasing the Empty Homes Tax to Five Percent and Improving Compliance
MOVED by Mayor Stewart
SECONDED by Councillor Fry
WHEREAS
1. Most recent Statistics Canada data show the City of Vancouver continues to
have one of the lowest vacancy rates in the country at 1.1 percent;1
2. The Empty Homes Tax (EHT), also known as the "Vacancy Tax", was introduced
in 2017 to return empty and under-utilized properties to the market as long-term
rental homes for people who live and work in Vancouver;
3. The program requires residential property owners in Vancouver to self-declare
their property status each year;
4. Properties declared, determined, or deemed vacant are currently subject to a tax
of three percent of the property’s assessed taxable value;
5. Most residential properties are not subject to EHT, including homes that are
principal residences for at least six months of the year, homes rented out for at
least six months of the year, or homes that are eligible for other exemptions such
as death of the registered owner or major renovation activity;
6. According to the Empty Homes Tax Annual Report 2020, 5,854 of 195,012 (three
percent) of Vancouver homes were deemed vacant, of which 4,227 were
exempted under current council bylaw provisions and 1,627 deemed not exempt
and subject to the tax;2

Council Meeting
Minutes, April 26, 2022 23
7. Also, according to the Empty Homes Tax Annual Report 2020, “There is strong
evidence that the Empty Homes Tax is reducing the number of vacant residential
properties in Vancouver.” and, according to a recent Canadian Mortgage and
Housing Corporation report, “...of the 8,824 units converted to long-term rental in
the Vancouver CMA in 2019, an estimated 5,097 (58 percent) were located in the
City of Vancouver;3 and
8. Additional information provided by staff shows City of Vancouver staff performed
over 8,000 audits in 2019 and over 9,000 in 2020, with an average of 6.4 percent
of those audited found to be in non-compliance.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT the Empty Homes Tax will be increased from three percent to five percent
for the 2023 vacancy tax reference year.
B. THAT the number of audits will be doubled from the current rate of 9,000, and
increased to 20,000 for the 2023 vacancy tax reference year.
C. THAT staff be directed to report back to council by Q1 2023 regarding:
● How the Empty Homes Tax might be used to reduce the large number of
short-term rental properties;
● How the Empty Homes Tax exemptions might be altered to improve fairness
so that those with legitimate reasons for vacancy are not penalized;
● What additional measures the City may need to counteract the Empty Homes
Tax avoidance;
● How the Empty Homes Tax will be affected by the new federal anti-flipping
measures that tax profits from properties sold within 12 months of a
purchase; and
● How increasing the rate to 10 percent might further increase rental stock.

4. CCTV Cameras for the Purpose of Public Safety and Deterring and Solving Violent
Crime
MOVED by Councillor De Genova
SECONDED by Councillor Hardwick
WHEREAS
1. Many large cities worldwide, including London and New York, utilize CCTV
cameras as a means of surveillance to help deter and solve violent crimes;
2. Technology has advanced in the United Kingdom, and the Metropolitan Police
have moved beyond CCTV cameras by implementing Facial Recognition
technology. The Metropolitan police have stated, “Facial Recognition (FR)
technology can be used in a number of ways by the Met, including to prevent and
detect crime, find wanted criminals, safeguard vulnerable people, and to protect
people from harm.”;
3. Washington, New York and Orlando are among the cities in the United States of
America piloting and implementing Facial Recognition technology;
4. During the 2010 Olympics, CCTV cameras were installed and recorded in
specific public areas. These cameras and their footage helped maintain public
safety and solve violent crime in the City of Vancouver.
For example, CCTV footage helped bring justice to a violent crime committed on
Granville Street during the 2010 Olympics when a man attacked a stranger,
slashing his throat with a box cutter;
5. Smartphones equipped with video recording are common, and in many countries,
including Canada, there are no laws precluding people from filming people in
public spaces;
6. Expanding CCTV cameras in public spaces in the City of Vancouver was
debated by Vancouver City Council in 2018. However, violent crime has since
increased;
7. The City of Vancouver currently uses public safety cameras to ‘support public
safety operations during planned events like the Celebration of Lights and assist
first responders during emergencies.’ The City of Vancouver website includes
maps with the locations of these cameras; and
8. Privately owned and installed CCTV cameras have assisted police in
investigations to solve crimes. However, the coverage of these cameras cannot
be relied on for consistency or coverage city-wide.

Council Meeting
Minutes, April 26, 2022 25
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to engage the Vancouver Police Department and
determine critical areas where CCTV cameras could be installed in public, yet not
monitored live, to deter violent crime and collect evidence to help solve violent
crime;
FURTHER THAT Council direct staff to report back to Council in Q3 2022 with
recommendations, including recommendations to fund CCTV cameras, to
prioritize public safety.
B. THAT Council direct staff to engage the Vancouver Police Department and the
Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner to conduct a Privacy Impact
Assessment;
FURTHER that staff work with the Vancouver Police Department to develop a
strategy to educate property owners, businesses and residents about the value
of using CCTV cameras to deter crime and help solve incidents of violent crime
occurring in the City of Vancouver and report back to Council with an update by
Q3 2022.

vehicles as soon as possible, to the extent possible given our
jurisdictional powers.
5. The governments of Canada and British Columbia are both signatories to this

ENQUIRIES AND OTHER MATTERS
1. Update: Sustaining Vancouver’s Chinatown
Councillor Fry requested an update on the Motion entitled “Sustaining Vancouver’s Chinatown”,
approved by Council at the Standing Committee on City Finance and Services meeting on
November 25, 2020, specifically staff’s work to prepare an expedited, innovative tenanting and
activation strategy for the City-owned Chinatown Plaza (106 Keefer Street) with the goal of
creating a vibrant hub in this historic neighbourhood that also enables ongoing programming
and placemaking. The City Manager provided a brief update which included staff’s previous
recommendation to repurpose the property as a destination food hall; however due to the
Covid-19 pandemic, staff was unable to further pursue this option. The City Manager agreed to
follow up with staff and provide an update.
2. Licensing for Food Courier App Delivery Riders
Councillor Fry enquired whether the Vehicles for Hire By-law No. 6066 could be updated to also

3. Update: Winters Hotel Fire
Councillor Fry enquired whether Council will receive an update from Fire Chief Fry in regards to
the Winters Hotel fire incident. The City Manager noted further updates to Council are
forthcoming.
4. Elected Officials Intergovernmental Collaboration
Councillor Wiebe enquired whether it would be possible for staff to look at new models of
collaboration between other levels of governments’ elected officials and the City’s
Intergovernmental team, in order to deal with inter-jurisdictional issues. The City Manager noted
that the City is always communicating with the Federal and Provincial governments, for
example, through the Mayor’s conversations with other elected officials, and staff working at
other staff levels within those governments. The City Manager also noted that if Council is
interested in engaging with other elected officials, City staff would be happy to facilitate.
5. Update: Budget and Spending on UNESCO in Chinatown
Councillor De Genova enquired whether staff have had a chance to reply to this enquiry,
previously made at the last Council meeting on April 12, 2022. City Manager noted that staff

and Rescue Services department provides inspections twice a year, and members of the public
are encouraged to report any fire detector malfunctions to 3-1-1, and those reports will be
communicated to the Fire teams to further investigate. The City Manager agreed to follow-up
with a written response.
