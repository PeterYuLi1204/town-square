5. Formalize the False Creek to the Fraser River Blueways
On May 14, 2019, Vancouver City Council referred the following item to the Standing Committee
on Policy and Strategic Priorities meeting on May 15, 2019, in order to hear from speakers, with
a start time of 3pm.
The Committee heard from one speaker in support of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Wiebe
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. A blueway is a network of bodies of water, either on the surface (like rivers,
creeks and lakes) or subsurface (aquifers). All blueways exist within a watershed
– an area of land that catches rain/snow and where water flows downward into a
specific river, stream, lake or acquifer. Blueways either exist in the present or
formerly existed in the past. Present day blueways can be managed from the
perspective of ecological preservation and stormwater management while former
blueways are treated by restoring or daylighting them. Existing blueways and
restored/daylighted blueways revive and protect ecosystems within our urban
communities to help cities deal with the impacts of climate change. They improve
water quality, absorb carbon and heavy rainfall, buffer floods, protect and expand
urban forests, and increase biodiversity and wildlife habitats. By incorporating
trails and bike paths, blueways can improve health and wellbeing, connect us to
each other, and provide active ways of moving around the region. Currently,
various creek networks exist within two watersheds: the China Creek Watershed
and the Brunette Watershed;
2. Much of the creek network runs alongside the existing Central Valley Greenway
and BC Parkway and is within close proximity to public transit at all points.
Connecting and formalizing this blueway would increase access to water for local
residents across three of BC’s largest communities. By advancing the use of
blueways in urban areas, the City of Vancouver can limit its biodiversity loss while
educating the public on the value and benefits of reconnecting habitats and
rehabilitating natural areas in order to allow species not only to survive, but
thrive;
3. Significant work has already been done to create the Central Valley Greenway
and BC Parkway through a collaborative effort by Translink, MetroVan, and the
cities of Vancouver, Burnaby, and New Westminster. Many environmental
stewardship groups have also kept the restoration of Still Creek and the Brunette
River as a high profile issue. This blueways transformation process will enhance,
restore and connect ecologically important systems along these paths;
4. In July 1988, Council endorsed Still Creek to be maintained as an open
watercourse, and committed to pursuing daylighting, alongside a continuous
pedestrian/bicycle pathway linking Burnaby Lake to the BC Parkway at 29th
Avenue Station. In July 2000, Council established the Still Creek Greenway
Enhancement Fund. In July 2002, Council adopted the Grandview Boundary

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, May 15, 2019 9
Industrial Area Rezoning and Development Policies and Guidelines which
contain specific guidelines and a 10 and 50 year action plan to protect and
enhance Still Creek. In December 2006, Council endorsed the Integrated
Stormwater Management Plan (ISMP) for the Still Creek Watershed which
identifies private and public actions to improve stormwater management,
recreational opportunities, and creek health. In April 2008, Council authorized
that the annual income from the lease of 2500 Skeena Street be held in the Still
Creek Greenway Enhancement Fund for ongoing initiatives. Still Creek illustrates
successful collaboration on ecosystem restoration between the cities of
Vancouver and Burnaby in Metro Vancouver. Partnership, creative governance,
community engagement, and innovative funding approaches were all essential
components that helped the two cities come together to invest in ecosystem
health and restore Still Creek, one of only two daylit streams in the City of
Vancouver. After decades of pollution and neglect, this collaboration led to many
benefits, including the return of spawning salmon, yet there still remains a lot of
work to do;
5. Over the past 30 years, Burnaby and New Westminster have demonstrated
strong leadership in creek restoration, natural asset protection, and ecosystem
rehabilitation along this blueway. This intermunicipal work in the rehabilitation of
the creek helped chum salmon return to the Vancouver section of Still Creek in
2012 for the first time in nearly 80 years. With the renewal of the Burnaby Lake
lease there is an opportunity for Metro Vancouver to create a Regional Blueway
that supports this effort;
6. The majority of work that remains lies in daylighting China Creek in Vancouver,
expanding natural ecosystems and habitats along the entire blueway, and
connecting it to other Green spaces along the way. The first step is developing a
blueway transition plan to ensure the retention and protection of Vancouver’s
existing natural assets and real property along the route. The plan will aim to
daylight creeks, expand biodiversity, create amenities and public spaces, and
develop sub trails connecting it to other natural assets such as Trout Lake and
Renfrew Ravine. There are many opportunities for different stakeholders, cities,
regions, and nonprofits to join in a collaborative effort to realize a complete
Blueway from False Creek to the Fraser River
7. China Creek is currently buried in the False Creek flats. False Creek Flats may
see significant redevelopment in the coming years under the False Creek Flats
Area Plan (approved by Council on May 17, 2017), which can be built around or
upon the daylighting of China Creek;
8. In 2019, Vancouver City Council passed a Watershed Revival Plan, directing staff
to report back with a scope of work to develop a comprehensive watershed
management plan that includes prioritized strategies, including new land
acquisition, protecting existing waterway and habitat connections, daylighting
streams, and intergovernmental coordination with local First Nations and
neighbouring municipalities;
9. The Vancouver Park Board’s Parks and Recreation Services Master Plan set 10
goals to shape the next 25 years of Vancouver’s parks and recreation. Goal 6 is

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, May 15, 2019 10
to “create a green network that will connect our parks, waterfront and recreation
areas” and includes a draft concept for an interconnected green network;
10. The Vancouver School Board (VSB) approved the first ever Environmental
Sustainability Plan in 2019 to advance five key themes: sustainability in
education, green spaces, resource conservation and climate change,
sustainability transportation and leadership in sustainability. Multiple schools will
have connections to outdoor learning on the blueway, with Nootka Elementary
having the potential to enhance a portion of the creek on VSB land;
11. Metro Vancouver develops and manages municipal components of the Regional
Recreation Greenway Network, working with municipalities and First Nations to
identify where appropriate measures to protect, enhance and restore ecologically
important systems, features, corridors and establish buffers along watercourses,
coastlines, agricultural lands, and other ecologically important features;
12. The British Columbia Salmon Restoration and Innovation Fund, a contribution
program funded jointly by the federal and provincial government, will deliver up to
$142.85 million over 5 years to support BC’s fish and seafood sector, and to
ensure the restoration, protection and maintenance of healthy and diverse
salmon populations and their habitats;
13. Infrastructure Canada will deliver $3.917 Billion to municipalities through a
bilateral agreement with the Province of British Columbia under four funding
streams, including green infrastructure, over the next ten years;
14. The findings of a United Nations-backed report from the Intergovernmental
Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) were
approved by representatives of 132 governments in Paris in May 2019. The
report warns that nature is declining globally at rates unprecedented in human
history – and the rate of species extinctions is accelerating, with grave impacts
on people around the world. The report also tells us that it is not too late to make
a difference, but only if we start now at every level from local to global.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct City staff to develop a blueways
transformation plan from False Creek to the Fraser River through Trout and Burnaby
Lake and report back to Council in November 2019. The Plan is to:
1. Honour, respect and learn from the Musqueam, Squamish, Tsleil-Waututh and
Kwikwetlem First Nations traditional and contemporary relationship to the land
and waterways and to explore opportunities to collaboratively plan for the future;
2. Align with current and developing City plans, policies and strategies, including
the Shore to Core work already underway and to include this plan as part of the
report back to Council in November 2019;
3. Clarify roles and responsibilities amongst the City of Vancouver, the Vancouver
Park Board and the Vancouver School Board, in the delivery of the blueways
from False Creek to Boundary Road;

Minutes, Wednesday, May 15, 2019 11
4. Explore opportunities for collaborative planning with Metro Vancouver, the City of
Burnaby and the City of New Westminster on a regional strategy; and
5. Outline appropriate resourcing and coordination of staff, including exploring the
establishment of a Blueways Enhancement Fund.

12. The British Columbia Salmon Restoration and Innovation Fund, a contribution
program funded jointly by the federal and provincial government, will deliver up to
$142.85 million over 5 years to support BC’s fish and seafood sector, and to
ensure the restoration, protection and maintenance of healthy and diverse
salmon populations and their habitats;
13. Infrastructure Canada will deliver $3.917 Billion to municipalities through a
bilateral agreement with the Province of British Columbia under four funding

14. The findings of a United Nations-backed report from the Intergovernmental
Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) were
approved by representatives of 132 governments in Paris in May 2019. The
report warns that nature is declining globally at rates unprecedented in human
history – and the rate of species extinctions is accelerating, with grave impacts
on people around the world. The report also tells us that it is not too late to make
a difference, but only if we start now at every level from local to global.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to develop a scope of work for a blueways
transformation plan from False Creek to the Fraser River through Trout Lake and

and Kwikwetlem First Nations traditional and contemporary relationship to
the land and waterways and to explore opportunities to collaboratively

6. Considering Animal Welfare in Vancouver’s Procurement Policies
On May 14, 2019, Vancouver City Council referred the following item to the Standing Committee
on Policy and Strategic Priorities meeting on May 15, 2019, in order to hear from speakers, with
a start time of 3pm.
The Committee heard from one speaker in support of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Fry
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. Procurement of goods and services by the City of Vancouver are guided
by the Ethical Purchasing Policy (AF-014-01) and the Supplier Code of
Conduct: these policies ensure that purchases by the City are informed
by values like ethics and fair trade, fair wages and environmental impacts;
2. The City of Vancouver Procurement Policy, Ethical Purchasing Policy and
Supplier Code of Conduct are not currently or explicitly informed by
animal welfare, specifically but not limited to pest control, or animal
related businesses;
3. The City of Vancouver purchases animal food products for hosted events
can source third-party certified products;
4. Animal welfare is the scientific assessment of an animal’s physical and
mental state in relation to its quality of life, including experiences in life
and death;
5. The basic necessities to ensure the welfare of animals under human
control are legally enshrined and internationally recognized by the BC
SPCA, Humane Canada, the Canadian Medical Veterinary Association,
and many other professional groups as the Five Freedoms:
i. freedom from hunger, malnutrition and thirst;
ii. freedom from fear and distress;
iii. freedom from physical and thermal discomfort;
iv. freedom from pain, injury and disease; and
v. freedom to express normal patterns of behaviour;
6. Animal welfare accreditation and certification programs serve to further
improve animals’ quality of life in addition to the basic Five Freedoms. For
example, auditing animal-related businesses (e.g. pest control, dog
training, boarding, etc.) to ensure they follow a set of evidence-based
standards, and use the kindest, most humane methods. Many of these
said animal-related business services are accessed by the City of
Vancouver, for building maintenance contracts and animal control
directives;

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, May 15, 2019 17
7. Animal welfare farm certification programs offer third-party certification for
the animal farming industry with assurance that the food products come
from farms with “higher welfare” standards in place;
8. Foods such as foie gras (fatty liver of force-fed ducks or geese) or shark
fin (slicing off a shark's fin and discarding the rest of the still-living animal
to die) are harvested in an inherently inhumane manner and inconsistent
with animal welfare practices;
9. In February 2019, the BC Ministry of Agriculture acknowledged the value
of animal welfare by adopting into legislation the NFACC codes of
practice for the care and handling of farm animals, which outline minimum
care standards for animals;
10. In 2013, Vancouver became the first city in Canada to embrace "Meatless
Monday," encouraging residents to forego meat for one day a week for
the sake of the planet and their health, including lighter environmental
footprint, and animal welfare.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council affirms a commitment to progressive animal welfare as part
of any ethical purchasing policies by the City of Vancouver.
B. THAT staff review the City of Vancouver’s Ethical Purchasing Policy and
report back to Council with recommendations on how to incorporate
animal welfare language into it.
C. THAT staff review the City of Vancouver’s Supplier Code of Conduct to
ensure that City suppliers and their sub-contractors will operate, where
applicable, within recognized animal welfare accreditation standards,
specifically but not limited to pest control, or animal related businesses.

UNFINISHED BUSINESS
1. Supporting the Call for Changing the Cheque Day Paradigm
At the Regular Council meeting on May 14, 2019, due to time constraints, Council referred the
above-noted motion to the Regular Council meeting following the Standing Committee on Policy
and Strategic Priorities meeting to be held on May 15, 2019, as Unfinished Business.
MOVED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
SECONDED by Councillor Hardwick
WHEREAS
1. MLA Jane Thornthwaite submitted a private bill titled the Welfare Payment System
Reflection Act calling upon the Province of BC to change the practice for distribution
of social assistance cheques;
2. The bill asks the Province of British Columbia to call upon the Minister responsible
for the processing of income assistance to prepare a report on alternatives in
payment processing to individuals receiving assistance, and states the report must
consider but is not limited to considering the following:
(a) Providing welfare, disability assistance or other income assistance in
multiple payments throughout a month as opposed to single monthly
payment;
(b) Alternative payment systems that enable responsible spending of
assistance;
3. Further, the bill indicates that the Ministers conducting this consultation must consult
with, but are not limited to consulting with, individuals receiving welfare, disability
assistance or other income assistance, groups advocating for those receiving
welfare, disability assistance or other income assistance, and the Union of BC
Municipalities;
4. In April 2016 the Province of BC declared the increase in overdose deaths a public
health emergency. Vancouver has been at the center of this crisis. Fentanyl-
detected overdose deaths were 152 in 2016, 306 in 2017 and 337 in 2018. BC
Coroners confirmed Vancouver overdose deaths were 232 in 2016, 376 in 2017 and

Regular Council
Minutes, Wednesday, May 15, 2019 3
387 in 2018. In conjunction with the overdose health emergency, the practice of
distributing social assistance cheques on the same day/s creates acute service
demand peaks for first responders, putting a strain on first responder and City staff
resources that can exceed capacity to deal with incidents. This has created
increasing job and emotional stress on our first responders;
5. Medical health experts and first responders know there is a significant spike in drug-
related deaths within days of people receiving their social assistance cheques. On
average, overdose deaths can be 40% higher during income assistance payment
week according to the BC Coroners Service report on Illicit Drug Overdose Deaths
in BC (2009-2019);
6. Vancouver averaged about 22 overdose calls a day to B.C. paramedics in 2017 and
has averaged about 20 calls a day in 2018 according to BC Emergency Health
Services. Insite once averaged a couple of overdoses a day but in 2018 saw closer
to seven a day after the fentanyl crisis took hold, and recorded 16 overdoses on a
cheque day and 11 the following day;
7. The call to change the current cheque day distribution practice has been endorsed
by Vancouver Fire and Rescue Services;
8. In December 2018, Council unanimously adopted the Mayor’s Overdose Emergency
Task Force - Recommendations for Immediate Action on the Overdose Crisis
recognizing it will take concerted efforts to change the course of the crisis. The
report included calling for collective action for systemic changes;
9. Dr. Lindsey Richardson, Research Scientist at BC Centre on Substance Use and
Associate Professor, Sociology at the University of BC, was the principal
investigator leading a study on the impact of alternative social assistance
disbursement on drug-related harm or TASA ‘cheque day’ study. Initiated in 2012,
the study recognized that synchronized payments have been linked to escalations in
drug use and unintended but severe drug-related harms, including overdose, as well
as spikes in demand for health, social, financial and first responder services;
10. Vancouver needs continued concrete action on prevention, treatment and recovery
options for mental health and addictions to turn the tide on the number of deaths.
Changing and varying cheque schedules may be one small brick in a bigger wall
that could break down the social phenomenon of a one approach distribution
practice. Further, change will help alleviate the strain on overdose services, and the
significant physical and emotional toll on our first responders, city staff and support
organizations.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council endorse the Welfare Payment System Reflection Act bill for the
Province of BC to consider alternatives in payment processing to individuals
receiving welfare, disability or other income assistance.
B. THAT the Mayor, on behalf of Council, write to the Premier, Minister of Social
Development and Poverty Reduction as well as the Minister for Mental Health and

Regular Council
Minutes, Wednesday, May 15, 2019 4
Addictions, stating Council’s endorsement and encouragement to consider
alternative cheque day distribution practices.
C. THAT the Mayor, on behalf of Council, write to the Union of BC Municipalities
(UBCM) stating Council’s endorsement and encouraging them to ask member
municipalities to endorse the call for the Province of BC to consider alternatives in
payment processing to individuals receiving welfare, disability or other income
assistance.

WHEREAS
1. Annually, 420 Vancouver has refused to respect the requirements of the City of
Vancouver and the Vancouver Board of Parks and Recreation and the decisions
carried by Vancouver City Council and the Vancouver Park Board;
2. Organizations, companies, businesses or individuals must obtain permits for large
events or festivals held in a park and any public spaces located in the City of

are conditional to permit approval. This includes non-profit organizations and private
events that donate proceeds directly to charities or non-profit organizations;

Regular Council
Minutes, Wednesday, May 15, 2019 5
3. The medical use of cannabis was legalized in 2001 and on October 17, 2018, the
recreational use of cannabis was legalized when the federal “Cannabis Act” came
into effect;
4. The City of Vancouver has issued municipal development permits and business
licenses to three private non-medical cannabis retail store locations, working within
the regulations required by the Provincial Government. Currently, the City of
Vancouver holds the most locations with this type of license issued by the Provincial
Government’s Liquor and Cannabis Regulation Branch in British Columbia;
5. On April 18, 2018, before recreational cannabis was legalized in Canada, 420
Vancouver Organizer Dana Larsen was quoted in the Georgia Straight as saying "I
feel that with legalization, we should see that there are more cannabis-related
events, and that you can have cannabis events that aren't political protests—just
events where people are enjoying cannabis, like the way you can enjoy alcohol at
so many events in Vancouver";
6. Since legalization in 2018, 420 Vancouver organizers have not obtained a permit
and have refused to comply with the City of Vancouver and the Board of Vancouver
Parks and Recreation by-laws and Large Event and Festival requirements, including
the Park Board Smoking Regulation By-Law;
7. The 420 Vancouver website (420vancouver.com) advertises “25th Annual 420
Protest + Farmer’s Market” at Sunset Beach Park in Vancouver on Saturday
April 20, 2019. The page “About” self identifies as a “Protest Festival & Farmer’s
Market”, however it does not state what is being “protested”. Each year’s event is
noted with a sentence in chronological order, and this year is described as “2019 will
mark Vancouver’s 25th Annual 4/20 Protest Festival. The amazing free cannabis
market, which we have created together is absolutely unique”;
8. The 420 Vancouver website advertises three options for sponsorship packages
ranging from $1,000 to $5,000 dollars. Sponsorship packages include: logo to be
displayed on banner in prominent location, video screens, shout-outs on stage and
the ability to send online-promos to social media followers. Live Broadcast packages

interviews, shout-outs, company logo on pillow “on-set”, main stage and vendor
screen displays;

spaces at Sunset Beach Park at three price points ranging from $550 to $1000
each;

Beach Park in “Vancouver, Canada”;
11. The City of Vancouver and Vancouver Park Board Application for large events and
festivals requires detailed information for categories including: sales of any kind,
entertainment (noting commercial third-party liability insurance requirements),
sponsors-vehicle access/parking requirements and other proposed activities.
Applicants must attach a site-plan, route map, budget and waste management form.

Regular Council
Minutes, Wednesday, May 15, 2019 6
The permit agreement requires Comprehensive General Liability Insurance (starting
at $2 million and increasing subject to event size and characteristics) protecting the
City of Vancouver, Vancouver Board of Parks and Recreation, and the Vancouver
Police Board against liability for bodily injury, death or property damage, arising out
of the event;
12. The Canada Day Parade, Davie Street Party, and St. Patrick’s Day Parade are all
events that complied with the conditions and costs of the City of Vancouver permit
process. Organizers have stated in the media that increased costs related to the
permitting requirements significantly contributed to the cancellation of these events.
CBC reported on May 26, 2018, the concern of organizers for both Car Free Day
Vancouver and Italian Day on The Drive to accommodate rising City of Vancouver
costs in their event budgets;
13. A statement issued on April 23, 2018, on the City of Vancouver website notes
property damage to Sunset Beach Park from 420 Vancouver was confirmed to be
significant and required closing and fencing the park for several weeks and
described the required stages of restoration, including drying, cleaning, aerating,
topdressing, seeding and germination. The statement goes on to explain Sunset
Beach Park field was closed for 10 weeks after the 420 Vancouver event in 2017;
14. A public memo dated July 13, 2018, to Mayor, Council and Park Board
Commissioners, from the City Manager and Park Board General Manager stated the
Park Board invoiced 420 Vancouver organizers $64,870, for costs described as
restoring the grass in Sunset Beach Park, park event fees, staffing expenses,
sanitation costs, lost revenues and parking. The City of Vancouver invoiced

Vancouver Police Department (VPD), Engineering (Parking Enforcement, Street
Operations, Sanitation, and Traffic Operations), Emergency Management, and 311,
in the amount of $170,796. Combined the invoices total $235,666. News1130
reported and posted on their website an article dated September 10, 2018, stating
420 Vancouver organizer Dana Larsen confirmed $63,000 was paid to the City of
Vancouver and the Park Board;
15. The Vancouver Park Board passed a motion on April 15, 2019, by Commissioner
John Coupar to ask the organizers of 420 Vancouver to cancel the Cypress Hill
performance. The organizers stated in the media they did not plan to cancel the
event;
16. On April 16, 2019, in an interview with Stephen Quinn on the CBC Early Edition, 420
Vancouver organizer Dana Larsen confirmed that he could not get insurance for the
event because it did not have a permit.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to review options for legal action against “420 Vancouver

so many events in Vancouver";
