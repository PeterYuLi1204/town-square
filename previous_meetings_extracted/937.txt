Chauffeur’s Permit Appeal Hearing
Minutes, Tuesday, May 21, 2019 3
Mr. Dixon further explained that this was an appeal by Mr. Bagri, pursuant to section 36(7) of
the Motor Vehicle Act, from the decision of the Chief Constable to cancel the appellant’s
Chauffeur’s Permit under section 36(5) of the Motor Vehicle Act.
The refusal of the Permit application by the Chief Constable is pursuant to s. 6 of the City of
Vancouver’s Vehicles For Hire By-law No. 6066. The Chief Constable has refused the Permit
application based on the following, as documented in the Notice of Hearing dated May 6, 2019,
that was sent to Mr. Bagri by Registered Mail:
• the Applicant is a subject of multiple allegations of misconduct while employed as a taxi
driver; and
• the Applicant has exhibited a pattern of behavior which indicates that he is unfit to act as
a chauffeur.
Mr. Dixon noted that after hearing the appeal, Council may uphold or overturn the Chief
Constable’s decision to cancel the Chauffeur’s Permit issued to Kanwaljit Singh Bagri. He noted
the Panel should consider whether the Chief Constable correctly interpreted and applied the
applicable legislation to this particular set of circumstances in determining whether or not a
refusal of the Chauffeur's Permit was appropriate.
Mr. Dixon called Sergeant Jeff Rice, Taxi Detail, Vancouver Police Department, as a witness in
support of the allegations as set out in the documents considered by the Chief Constable in
refusing to issue the Permit, and contained within the Evidence Brief.
The Panel asked questions of the witness.
Mr. McLachlan asked follow-up questions of the witness.
Mr. McLachlan provided the Panel with a transcript from a conversation between Mr. Bagri and
Constable John Braithwaite, as recorded by Mr. Bagri and transcribed by Coast Reporting
Services.
In opening, Mr. McLachlan noted that Mr. Bagri, prior to working for Yellow Cab was a driver of
Richmond Taxi for six years, working the night shift, and never received a complaint during that
time. Mr. McLachlan also noted that Mr. Bagri was trialed in relation to one of the charges and
was acquitted.
Mr. McLachlan provided additional material to the Panel (copy on file). Subsequently, Mr.
McLachlan called Mr. Bagri, as a witness in opposition to the allegations as set out in the
documents considered by the Chief Constable in refusing to issue the Permit, and contained
within the Evidence Brief.
The Panel asked questions of Mr. Bagri.
Mr. Dixon asked follow-up questions of Mr. Bagri.
In closing, Mr. Dixon indicated the case takes on a “he-said, she-said” tone, and had this been
one or perhaps two incidences, the allegations could have perhaps gone unnoticed, but the fact

Minutes, Tuesday, May 21, 2019 4
that there are six complaints of a similar nature presents a pattern. Mr. Dixon also noted that
Mr. Bagri’s explanations of the accounts are convenient and that the summary provided by
Mr. Bagri seems to embellish details of incidents that occurred a number of years prior.
Mr. Dixon suggested the Panel uphold the decision of the Chief Constable.
A panel member asked questions to Mr. Dixon.
In closing, Mr. McLachlan summarized the difficult decision the Panel had and reminded the
Panel of ensuring fairness while taking into account that this is the livelihood of the defendant.
Mr. McLachlan reminded the Panel that the Provincial court acquitted Mr. Bagri and that he
passed a Polygraph test and noted that the VPD did not make Mr. Bagri aware of a number of
the complaints.
The Panel asked questions to Mr. McLachlan.
PANEL MEMBERS DECISION
In discussion, Panel members, after hearing all the evidence before them, concluded that the
Chief Constable’s cancellation of Mr. Bagri’s Chauffeur’s Permit be upheld.
