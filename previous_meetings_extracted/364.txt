3. Establishing an Inter-Municipal Business Licence for Home Healthcare Support
Workers
MOVED by Councillor Klassen
SECONDED by Councillor Zhou
WHEREAS
1. In 2014, the provincial government created a single mobile business license for
multiple municipalities for construction, trades, catering, and mobile (hair) salons.
These were created for multiple regions in BC including the Lower Mainland. See
information here: https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/employment-
business/business/small-business/mobile-business-licence-program;
2. Mobile business licences allow some types of businesses to work across
participating communities. They are also known as "inter-community business
licences" or "inter-municipal business licences.";
3. The City of Vancouver has an ongoing program of work to support older adults
and vulnerable populations. For example, many of Vancouver's seniors live on
limited incomes, and have been affected both by increased costs for health care,
and decreased access to services, such as home support;
4. The City of Vancouver has an Age-friendly Action Plan with a series of over 60
actions the City can take to help make Vancouver a more safe, inclusive, and
engaging city for seniors. The City’s goal is to improve facilities and services for
seniors across the full spectrum, from fully independent older adults and seniors,
to those who are more vulnerable and need additional support;
5. As part of the City’s ongoing efforts to support Vancouver's families, Council and
staff collaborate with the community and all levels of government to provide a
range of programs and facilities that keep seniors active, engaged, and
connected to the health services they need. Many seniors are also recent
immigrants who face significant language barriers. City staff therefore work to

Council Meeting
Minutes, May 9, 2023 19
increase access to services for these seniors, and support networking for seniors
across all cultures;
6. Home health (support) workers are employed by both public and private
companies. Most, but not all, support workers help seniors and people with
disabilities (often providing relief for family caregivers) and variously provide
shopping, meals, housekeeping, medicine allocation, and personal hygiene;
7. There are dozens of small and medium sized companies across Metro
Vancouver who manage teams of home support workers who drive to
appointments throughout the day. Many clients pay out of pocket for support
services unless they receive support through the health authorities or by
WorkSafeBC or ICBC claims; and
8. There is a strong rationale for the Provincial government, through the Ministry of
Jobs, Economic Development and Innovation, to expand the inter-municipal
business licence categories to include home support workers.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to explore the establishment
of an inter-municipal business licence (i.e., mobile business license) for home healthcare
support workers in coordination with their provincial and municipal counterparts, and in
consultation with relevant stakeholders, toward the expansion of home health support
workers as an eligible mobile business license category.
referred
REFERRAL MOVED by Councillor Carr
SECONDED by Councillor Montague
THAT the motion entitled “Establishing an Inter-Municipal Business Licence for Home
Healthcare Support Workers” be referred to the Standing Committee on City Finance
and Services meeting on May 10, 2023, to hear from speakers, followed by debate and
decision.

4. A People-Focused Gastown: A Bold, Forward-Looking Vision for a Vibrant and
Prosperous Neighbourhood
MOVED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
SECONDED by Councillor Klassen
WHEREAS
1. Gastown is the birthplace of our city, located within the unceded territories of the
Musqueam, Squamish, and Tsleil-waututh First Nations. It is a beloved historic
destination for locals and visitors alike;

Council Meeting
Minutes, May 9, 2023 20
2. Gastown is Vancouver’s oldest commercial district, becoming a booming hub
following the completion of the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1886. Many of the
current structures were built in the 1890s and are now preserved as heritage
buildings;
3. Historically Gastown has been at the centre of many of the city’s defining
moments, such as the Great Fire of 1886 when First Nations paddled across the
Burrard Inlet to help rescue people from the fire. The fire on June 13, 1886
largely destroyed the city, but it also created an opportunity to rebuild anew;
4. The Gastown area has long been a diverse and vibrant neighbourhood.
However, the streets of Gastown have been in need of major repair and
rehabilitation for some time and have now deteriorated to a state of critical
disrepair;
5. Planning and engagement processes have been ongoing over the course of
many years to explore how Gastown might be made an even better place for
people. For example, the Imagine Gastown Streets – Phase One Engagement
Summary 2017-2018;
6. Likewise, the Gastown Complete Streets Project outlined various goals and a
planning process, building in part from the Transportation 2040 plan and
Downtown Eastside Plan. The Complete Streets project notably identified four
key goals:
• Celebrate and acknowledge Gastown’s complex history and work towards
reconciliation
• Explore Vancouver’s first car-light area
• Address a major gap in the all ages and abilities cycling network
• Enhance transit service for buses and future streetcar;
7. And most recently, the Gastown Business Improvement Society (GBIS) released
an Urban Design Study in March 2020 to provide insight into how public realm
changes may affect Gastown business members, workers, residents, and visitors
alike and highlight community priorities for focused action. Community feedback
from the study included suggestions for more programming such as art
exhibitions and farmers markets, jazz festivals and chalk-art festivals, public
seating, a First Nations monument, covered meeting spaces and patios, art in a
variety of styles from First Nations and local artists reflective of the industrial
history of the neighbourhood, as well as a desire to keep with the historic vibe of
the neighbourhood; https://gastown.org/tomorrow/
8. In the 2023-26 Capital Plan, Council identified Gastown Streets as a priority and
approved $10 million in funding to support enhanced Host Nations visibility,
immediate repairs and improvements in Gastown, and the planning and design
process to guide the renewal of Water Street and Maple Tree Square as Phase
1; i

Council Meeting
Minutes, May 9, 2023 21
• Specifically, it was moved as an amendment at the 2023-2026 Capital
Plan Special Council Meeting on Wednesday, June 29, 2022 (by
Councillor Kirby-Yung and seconded by Councillor Dominato): “THAT
Council add $3 million to the Capital Budget for the Gastown/Water Street
project from emerging priorities funding, with overall funding increasing
from $7 million to $10 million, to advance additional targeted sidewalk
repairs and projects to enhance public realm in Gastown including
visibility of Host Nations.”
CARRIED (Vote No. 08621)
9. Additionally, at the Special Council meeting on June 29, 2022, on the 2023-26
Capital Plan, consistent with the identification of Gastown and Water Street as a
core infrastructure major renewal project and the motion to more quickly address
the significant degradation of the street and public realm in this historic
neighbourhood and the bigger overall project funding requirements, it was
determined that the Capital Plan Mid-term Update in 2024 provides the
opportunity to allocate funding to advance construction as Phase 2 (estimated at
$13M) and that the remainder of the work (estimated at $15M) could be included
in the 2027-30 Capital Plan;
10. In terms of planning for the major repair and rehabilitation the Gastown’s streets,
Council has received updates from staff advising on work with the Gastown BIA
and other stakeholders, including identifying alternatives for immediate repairs
and improvements in the neighbourhood;
11. More specifically, staff have advised that they have been developing a work
program for Gastown, and have made advances on some components such as
priority sidewalk repairs that began in 2022 and continue in 2023. Blood Alley
Square construction is also well underway and some restoration work for
Trounce Alley is scheduled for 2024; and
12. Staff have nevertheless identified that there is a gap in Council direction for the
long-term vision for Gastown Streets and public space, and that given the
recognition that the streets are in need of major repair and rehabilitation, and as
that planning and engagement processes that have been ongoing over the
course of many years to explore how Gastown might be made an even better
place for people, it is incumbent on Council to provide staff with direction on the
long-term vision for Gastown to help guide planning and investment in the area
and to move forward with revitalizing this historic and valued neighbourhood.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to proceed immediately with urgently needed patching
repairs and improvements to Water Street to address known deficiencies and
safety hazards and that staff not proceed with a larger asphalt treatment plan at
this time to be funded from the existing current Capital Plan allocation.

Council Meeting
Minutes, May 9, 2023 22
B. THAT Council direct staff to initiate, as quickly as possible, a streets and public
realm planning and design process for Gastown that brings in an external urban
place-making lens and expertise to the Gastown planning and engagement
process(es) toward a bold vision to pedestrianize Water Street and make it car-
free or car-light either on a seasonal or year-round basis, with the overarching
goal being a more vibrant, people-friendly destination and the enabling of
ongoing activations including patios, music, events, festivals and active
transportation opportunities.
C. THAT Council direct staff to seek to work with the Gastown Business
Improvement Society (GBIS) to pilot a car-free shut down of Water Street during
a month or on select weekends in the summer of 2023 and/or in summer 2024,
as desired by and in partnership with the GBIS and other Gastown stakeholders.
D. THAT staff planning efforts for Gastown shall include bringing potential strategic
directions to Council by the end of Q2 2024 with options to restore and expand
the irreplaceable public realm of this historic neighbourhood and enhance it as a
vibrant, people-friendly place.
E. THAT Council acknowledge the longer-term potential of changing the
configuration of Cordova Street from a one-way to a two-way street from the
Powell Street Overpass to Waterfront Station to support traffic flow in the area,
and to complement a more pedestrian-friendly Gastown;
FURTHER THAT Council direct staff to seek to engage with TransLink on related
bus infrastructure needs and requirements and report back to Council with high-
level considerations for a shift to a two-way street by the end of Q3 of 2023.

SECONDED by Councillor Carr
WHEREAS
1. The Broadway Plan is a thirty-year strategic plan to manage growth,
development, and displacement over an approximately 500 block area
surrounding the Broadway Subway. Envisioned as a future second downtown for
Vancouver, the area expects construction of significantly more job space and

Council Meeting
Minutes, May 9, 2023 24
services, and some 30,000 new homes;
2. The Broadway Plan area includes a large amount of existing older rental housing
and some of the City’s most affordable housing, with 30,000 exiting renter
households making up 59% of the local housing stock. These conditions require
a balanced development approach delivering new rental supply, providing
options for retention and renewal, and minimizing displacement;
3. Vancouver City Council approved the Broadway Plan in June 2022 and
recommended a specific “pace of change” approach for the rental apartment
areas, including direction:
“THAT Council direct staff to report back at a future date on a pace of change
approach for the Broadway Plan, including further study on an appropriate
number of applications and criteria for prioritizing applications based on their
merits.”;
4. The Broadway Plan Implementation report on March 29, 2023 included a Pace of
Change policy to manage the rate of redevelopment in existing (typically older,
affordable) apartment areas (RM zoning districts) only, while allowing projects in
all other areas to proceed in the usual course, enabling significant construction in
station areas before displacing exiting tenant areas;
5. Staff recommended a Pace of Change policy for RM-zoned areas that
anticipated:
a) Restricting redevelopment of tenanted multi-dwelling use buildings to
approximately 150 households / year over three years;
b) Broadway-plan specific Tenant Relocation Protection Policies and local
vacancy rates to accommodate the relocation of 110 households per
year;
c) Limiting the otherwise redevelopment and displacement of some 2,000
households per year; and
d) Enough enquiries and interest to develop as much as 6,300 units of
housing outside the RM-zoned Pace of Change areas with no
displacement;
6. In essence, the Broadway Plan’s proposed Pace of Change is synonymous with
Pace of Demoviction. A demoviction is when a tenant is displaced as a result of
their home being demolished for redevelopment. A renoviction is when a tenant
is displaced as a result of their home being renovated;
7. Staff reported that members of UDI and Landlord BC were strongly opposed to
the Pace of Change policy as they felt the tenant protections applicable to the
Broadway Plan area are sufficient protection and the market would be able to
address issues of redevelopment and relocation without further regulation;

Council Meeting
Minutes, May 9, 2023 25
8. The Tenant Relocation and Protection Policy (TRPP) offers robust length-of-
tenure based buy out options and rights of first refusal as applies to
demovictions: rezoning and development permit applications only;
9. Building permits for the purpose of renoviction: renovation or repairs that may
require a tenant to relocate, do not necessarily or explicitly trigger the TRPP. The
resulting renoviction under a building permit provides limited compensation but a
right to return at new (future) rents;
10. Real estate economics and opportunities have incentivized the redevelopment of
even newly renovated and newly tenanted buildings. 1 This loophole, if exploited
either by intent or by happenstance could allow for buildings to be emptied under
a building permit for renovation, then re-tenanted, and then subsequently cleared
for demolition and redevelopment -- thereby circumventing length-of-tenure and
right of return based TRPP;
11. In recent months Council has rejected both the Renters Office that would
otherwise track (non TRPP) renovictions, and the Broadway Plan Pace of
Change designed to limit demovictions; and
12. As part of the March 2023 Council approved Broadway Plan Implementation
report Council directed staff to provide an ongoing quarterly memo to:
“outline the number of housing projects that have progressed beyond the letter of
enquiry stage to the active application stage, including the number and tenure
type of housing units for these active applications, in order for Council to monitor
progress and trends, and to stay apprised of opportunities and challenges as the
Broadway Plan progresses.”
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council affirm a commitment to protect affordable rental stock in the
Broadway Plan area and seek staff support with data and strategies to manage
the pace of demoviction.
B. THAT Council direct staff to include as available annually, and as part of the
Council-directed Broadway Plan Implementation quarterly memo:
a. Building permits issued for multiple dwelling use renovations;
b. Demolition permits issued for multiple dwelling buildings;
c. Number of residents identified in City’s mandatory Needs Assessment
that are being considered under Tenant Relocation plans; and
d. Vacancy rates with average rents.
C. THAT Council direct staff to report back on a Broadway Plan area strategy to
identify:
a. Building permits issued for renovations that will require vacancy;
b. Number of tenants given Notice to End Tenancy for renovation;

6. The Bird is the Word: Elevating Vancouver’s Strategy
MOVED by Councillor Fry
SECONDED by Councillor Carr
WHEREAS
1. World Migratory Bird Day is celebrated twice a year in North America, on the
second Saturday of May and October. In 2023, these dates fall on May 13 and
October 14, respectively. Additionally, the Greater Vancouver Bird Celebration

Council Meeting
Minutes, May 9, 2023 27
takes place from May 13 to May 31; 1
2. The Greater Vancouver Bird Celebration is organized by the Vancouver Bird
Advisory Committee (VBAC). VBAC is a collaborative partnership of non-profits,
artists, and other institutions, in partnership with City of Vancouver and
Vancouver Park Board to assist on policies and strategies and to celebrate birds
throughout the region;
3. Over 250 species of resident, migratory and over-wintering birds are regularly
observed in greater Vancouver: from robins off Robson, to herons over Stanley
Park, eagles in Strathcona, Stellar Jays in Shaughnessy, and nightly migrations
of Northwestern Crows over East Van;
4. Vancouver is important for bird populations given our location on the Fraser River
delta, a major stop along the Pacific Flyway, which extends north to Alaska and
south to Central and South America. Locally, Fraser River Estuary; English Bay,
Burrard Inlet and Howe Sound; Greater Vancouver Watershed; and Pacific Spirit
Regional Park are considered Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas (a worldwide
conservation initiative coordinated by BirdLife International);
5. Birds play a crucial role in the mental wellbeing of Vancouver's population.
Studies have shown that the sounds and sights of birds help people connect with
nature, providing long-lasting stress relief and mental health benefits. During the
pandemic, birdwatching became a popular outdoor hobby due to its safety, low
cost, and calming nature. 2 According to researchers, regular encounters with
birdlife can improve mental wellbeing for up to eight hours. 3 Furthermore, birds
serve as a barometer of environmental health, serving as first responders in
detecting environmental pollution, much like the figurative canary in the coalmine;
6. Birds play a critical role in our environment as they serve as pollinators,
predators, seed dispersers, and scavengers. They are often referred to as
"ecosystem engineers" because of their mobility, which enables them to travel
long distances and connect various ecosystems. Birds contribute significantly to
the natural biotic diversity of ecosystems by consuming insects and pests,
reducing the spread of diseases, and enhancing the functioning and stability of
ecological systems;
7. Birdwatching is a viable tourism generator in keeping with Vancouver’s green
and natural brand. One birding conference, the 27th International Ornithological
Congress in August 2018 brought 1300 guests and $8 million in spending to
Vancouver alone. Birding tourism across the US accounted for an estimated $41
billion in 2016;
8. Birds in our urban environment face a number of significant threats and
challenges however, most notably:
a. Habitat loss: including tree canopy, green space, and waterways.
b. Climate crisis: extreme changes to weather, ecosystem and biodiversity
loss.

Council Meeting
Minutes, May 9, 2023 28
c. Invasive species: outcompeting native flora, domesticated predators like
cats.
d. Building collisions: a top ranking causes of bird mortality, with 16-42
million birds colliding with clear and reflective glass on buildings every
year in Canada.
e. Direct human disturbance: including pesticide use, excessive light and
noise pollution, and litter;
9. Globally, cities are taking up the challenge with efforts to protect birds: putting
stickers on windows, planting bird and pollinator friendly plants and trees, turning
off office building lights at night to avoid migrating birds from crashing into them,
and designing buildings and fenestration that are more bird friendly, as parts of
comprehensive bird strategies;
10. Under the leadership of the Park Board’s first Environmental Planner, the late
Alan Duncan, Vancouver became the first Canadian city with a council-approved
comprehensive bird strategy. The Vancouver Bird Strategy (first approved by
Council in 2015 and updated 2020) 4 identified five conditions for native birds to
thrive in the City:
a. Habitat: Protect, enhance and create habitats for a diversity of native
birds;
b. Threat Reduction: Reduce threats to birds in the urban environment;
c. Access: Improve access to nature for residents and visitors to the city;
d. Awareness: Increase awareness of the importance of birds and their
needs; and
e. Tourism: Encourage bird tourism and economic development
opportunities related to birding;
11. Resulting from the Strategy, the Bird Friendly Design Guidelines 5 were
implemented as a voluntary guide for applicants mainly on applicable Rezoning
and Conditional Development permit applications. In 2017, the Guidelines were
updated to include some lessons learned and to be ‘encouraged’ performance
objectives rather than ‘voluntary’ strategies. Since then, staff have gained a much
more detailed understanding of the strategies the industry finds are easily
implementable and others which may be more difficult or rarely utilized;
12. Despite efforts, many of the recommendations from the updated 2020 Vancouver
Bird Strategy remain unfulfilled, and human settlement, habitat loss,
development, and climate change are exacerbating further stress on birds in
Vancouver;
13. Vancouver was among the initial cities in Canada to receive the Bird Friendly City
certification in May 2021. 6 However, to maintain this certification, the city needs
to reapply every two years. As of now, there is a risk of Vancouver losing its
certification as a Bird Friendly City by September; and
14. In the last 50 years, North American bird populations have dropped by more than
25%. The 2022 edition of BirdLife International’s flagship report State of the
World’s Birds warns that nearly half of all bird species are in decline, with more

Council Meeting
Minutes, May 9, 2023 29
than one in eight at risk of extinction, and only a few years to collectively and
globally address and reverse the crisis by 2030. 7
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council proclaims May 13 - 31, 2023, as Vancouver Bird Celebration.
B. THAT Council direct staff to reapply for certification as a Bird Friendly City.
C. THAT Council affirms its commitment to the Vancouver Bird Strategy updated in
2020 including but not limited to the following specific recommendations that the
Council would like to reiterate, and direct staff to review and report back on:
a. Bird Friendly Design Guidelines to improve building and landscape
design, and in particularly sensitive zones of the city;
b. Updated Bird Friendly Landscape Operational Guidelines for approval by
Council and Park Board to ensure the most effective bird friendly
management practices in parks and other public open spaces;
c. Seek to work with Tourism Vancouver, Tourism Richmond, and
Destination BC to incorporate Vancouver focused content into the BC
Bird Trail initiative, as a means of growing bird tourism in Vancouver and
the region.
D. THAT Council affirm its commitment to the Vancouver Bird Strategy and Bird
Friendly Design Guidelines in emergent and future initiatives that consider green
roofs, increasing tree canopy, rewilding, greenways, country lanes, stream
daylighting, bio swales, and similar urban-natural interfaces.
E. THAT Council direct staff to report back with an evaluation of the impact of Bird
