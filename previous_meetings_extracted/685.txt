workers of colour and women workers who are over-represented in frontline jobs,
with low pay, few benefits, and without the ability to work from home.

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, February 24, 2021 7
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct the Mayor to call on the Province
to legislate a minimum of ten (10) permanent, paid sick days for all workers and

full-time equivalent (FTE), type of work, or immigration status. Legislated, with no
exemptions;
• Paid: fully paid to ensure workers are not financially penalized for following public
health advice;
• Adequate: at least ten (10) paid sick days provided on a permanent basis, with
additional paid sick days as required during public health emergencies;
• Permanent: Available during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond; and
• Accessible: No barriers to access. Prohibit employers from requiring sick notes;
ensure no disruption of income or unnecessary applications; and provide
sufficiently flexible leave that reflects the reality of workers’ lives, healthcare
needs, and caregiving responsibilities.

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, February 24, 2021 10
MOVED by Councillor Bligh
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. The City of Vancouver faces growing needs and funding pressures related to
social services, affordability and housing, public health, environmental
sustainability, amongst other areas;1
2. Large Canadian cities need access to additional revenue and diversity of funding
sources, like their U.S. and European counterparts, if they are to meet their
growing funding requirements;2
3. Traditional municipal funding tools (i.e., the combination of property tax and user
fees) are not the most equitable or strategic approach to funding many types of
services currently provided by local governments, which has been echoed by
UBCM which highlights its failure to respond to economic growth;34
4. Relative to senior levels of government, Canadian cities have limited debt
capacity to finance significant investment in maintaining and renewing public
works, utilities, affordable housing, social and community facilities, etc. while also
addressing climate resilience and other emerging needs;
5. There is a pattern of government underinvestment in preventative services with a
longer-term “payback period”, which may in part be related to short-term
budgeting pressures;5
6. Nascent social initiatives with limited empirical evidence available to-date, yet
high potential for social and economic benefits, often struggle to secure the
required seed funding;6
7. Several global jurisdictions are leveraging innovative “social impact funding”
strategies, combining charitable, private, and government capital to fund services
not well supported by traditional funding mechanisms;7
8. Social impact funding strategies have been used in London in a variety of areas,
such as the London Energy Efficiency Fund which leveraged capital investments
and external financing towards low carbon innovation projects that reduced
carbon emissions by 40K tons and grew into the more expansive Mayor of
London’s Energy Efficiency Fund;8

Minutes, Wednesday, February 24, 2021 11
9. There have been growing interests in social impact investment opportunities with
a focus on environmental, social, governance (ESG) from private and institutional
investors, and philanthropic and charitable organizations in Canada that seek
both financial and social return on their investment;
10. Social Impact Bonds have been utilized in Canada by organizations like the
Heart and Stroke Foundation, which has worked with MaRS Impact Investing to
create a ‘pay-for-success’ model that funds their ‘Activate’ program and
generates returns tied to reduced blood pressure;9
11. Social Impact Bonds have also been used by provincial governments, such as in
Manitoba, where they are funding the ‘Restoring the Sacred Bond’ program that
matches indigenous doulas with at-risk mothers to support them through
pregnancy and childbirth, aiming to reduce the number of days children spend in
provincial care;10
12. Social impact funding can be utilized by the City of Vancouver to leverage
additional funding from social impact investors to fund services the City is already
paying for, or may plan to procure, for social outcomes;
13. The City of Vancouver, from time to time, awards grants to, and procures
services from, certain not-for-profit organizations in order to achieve outcomes
that have social and environmental benefits in the city and beyond; and
14. The City may be able to leverage its relationships with these organizations and
bridge them with third party social impact investors to amplify the social and
environmental benefits that may be achieved. This can potentially minimize the
need for more City debt, higher property taxes or further budget pressure in order
to achieve these benefits and helping nurture a local social impact investment
community.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to develop a framework as
part of the Municipal Finance Reform work to identify and expand the set of City tools
(which may include specific fiscal tools and ability to leverage the City’s relationships)
that may be used to achieve and potentially amplify, our social and environmental policy
goals and outcomes by leveraging the resources and expertise of third party social
impact investors while enabling them to earn a reasonable return. The framework and
plan should address the following criteria:
(a) encourage collaboration and partnerships between organizations that need
funding and third-party social impact investors;
(b) foster the growth and maturity of social impact investing in Vancouver;
(c) identify criteria, challenges, success factors, and innovative ways (e.g. special
purpose vehicles) that enable social impact investing to have the most significant
impact in terms of achieving policy outcomes and potential reduction in future
costs for the City, while achieving reasonable returns for the social impact
investor community; and

14. The City may be able to leverage its relationships with these organizations and
bridge them with third party social impact investors to amplify the social and
environmental benefits that may be achieved. This can potentially minimize the
need for more City debt, higher property taxes or further budget pressure in order
to achieve these benefits and helping nurture a local social impact investment
community.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to report back on potential
opportunities to leverage and nurture social impact investing that may be used to
achieve and potentially amplify, our social and environmental policy goals and
outcomes. The report should address the following criteria:
(a) encourage collaboration and partnerships between organizations that need
funding and third-party social impact investors;
(b) foster the appropriate growth of social impact investing in Vancouver;
(c) identify criteria, challenges, success factors, and innovative ways (e.g. special
purpose vehicles) that enable social impact investing to have best possible
impact in terms of achieving policy outcomes and potential reduction in future
costs for the City;
(d) identify service areas that have potential for delivering reasonable investment
and social return that could attract social impact investments;
