6. Declaring a Homelessness Emergency: Making an Emergency Plan to Drastically
Reduce Homelessness
The Committee heard from two speakers in support of the recommendations.
MOVED by Councillor Swanson
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. At least 2,223 people were counted as homeless across Vancouver in 2019;
2. At least 7,655 were counted as homeless across British Columbia;
3. At least 30,000 are homeless in Canada in any one day with 235,000
experiencing homelessness in a year;
4. Homelessness robs people of their security, dignity, rights and lives - homeless
people have about half the life expectancy as housed people;
5. Canadians are upset by the fact that we have homelessness in a rich country,
and that people have to live on the streets. On June 21, 2019, the Governor
General of Canada signed into law Bill C-97, which contained the National
Housing Strategy Act, and the federal right to housing legislation - which
enshrines “adequate housing as a fundamental human right;
6. Numerous academic studies have established that providing secure housing is a
more cost-effective solution to homelessness than maintaining temporary
shelters and incurring additional policing, mental health service, and health care
costs;
7. The full continuum of housing needs far outweigh local government’s available
resources and funding required to effectively address this issue, and desperately
needs the support of both the Provincial and Federal governments;
8. BC Housing and other social housing providers have long wait lists and a lack of
available housing, while:
a. Low rent housing is being lost to rent increases when tenants
move out;
b. Not enough social housing at welfare rate is coming on-stream to
make up for the loss of low rent housing; and
c. Modular housing works well to house people who have been
homeless, but the province isn’t funding enough of them to meet

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, February 26 and Tuesday, March 3, 2020 10
the demand;
9. Single Room Occupancy (SRO) hotels are often the last resort before
homelessness. SROs are being bought by investors who are evicting current low
income tenants by renovating and increasing the rents. Vancouver could lose
hundreds of SRO rooms to this practice;
10. Welfare and disability shelter rates as determined by the province are too low at
$375 per month to even cover operating costs for an SRO room;
11. Skyrocketing prices for housing and land over the past 10 years, spurred by low-
interest rates and financial speculation, have turned Vancouver into one of the
most expensive housing markets in the world, far out of reach of most local
incomes;
12. On January 29, 2020, following a unanimous council vote, Ottawa became the
first city in Canada to declare a housing and homelessness emergency; and
13. The circumstances and extent of homelessness in Vancouver constitute a crisis
and emergency situation.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Vancouver City Council declares a Homelessness Emergency.
B. THAT Council urge the federal and provincial governments as well as regional
and local governments along with other partners, to make a Homelessness
Emergency plan to build or find dignified, affordable housing for at least 80
percent of counted homeless people within three years.
C. THAT Council direct staff to incorporate this target into the existing Housing and
Homelessness Strategy and be a key focus of the Housing and Homelessness
Strategy ongoing.
D. THAT this Homelessness Emergency plan includes raising social assistance
shelter rates so people can afford to pay rent.
E. THAT this Homelessness Emergency plan includes recommendations for
implementing vacancy control as a tool to preserve existing lower rent
accommodation.
F. THAT Council direct staff to prepare and submit the following Homelessness
Emergency declaration and request for a plan, along with whereas clauses 2, 4
and 5, as a resolution to the Lower Mainland Local Government Association
(LMLGA) and the Union of BC Municipalities (UBCM):
i. THAT the UBCM declare a province-wide Homelessness
Emergency and call upon the Province to work with local
governments, BC Housing and other partners on a Homelessness
Emergency Plan to build or find dignified, affordable housing for at

least 80 percent of counted homeless people within three years;
and
ii. THAT the UBCM recommends the province implement vacancy
control as a tool to preserve existing lower rent accommodation.
G. THAT Council direct staff to prepare and submit this Homelessness Emergency
declaration and request for a plan, along with whereas clauses 3, 4 and 5, as a
resolution to the Federation of Canadian Municipalities (FCM):
i. THAT the FCM declare a nation-wide Homelessness Emergency
and call upon the Federal Government to work with local and
provincial governments, and other partners on a Homelessness
Emergency Plan to build or find dignified, affordable housing for at
least 80 percent of counted homeless people within three years.

9. Single Room Occupancy (SRO) hotels are often the last resort before
homelessness. SROs are being bought by investors who are evicting current low
income tenants by renovating and increasing the rents. Vancouver could lose
hundreds of SRO rooms to this practice;
10. Welfare and disability shelter rates as determined by the province are too low at
$375 per month to even cover operating costs for an SRO room;
11. Skyrocketing prices for housing and land over the past 10 years, spurred by
low-interest rates and financial speculation, have turned Vancouver into one of
the most expensive housing markets in the world, far out of reach of most local
incomes;
12. On January 29, 2020, following a unanimous council vote, Ottawa became the
first city in Canada to declare a housing and homelessness emergency; and
13. The circumstances and extent of homelessness in Vancouver constitute a crisis
and emergency situation.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Vancouver City Council declares a Homelessness Emergency.
B. THAT Council urge the federal and provincial governments as well as regional
and local governments along with other partners, to make a Homelessness
Emergency plan to build or find dignified, affordable housing for at least 80
percent of counted homeless people within three years.
C. THAT this Homelessness Emergency plan includes raising social assistance
shelter rates so people can afford to pay rent.
D. THAT this Homelessness Emergency plan includes recommendations for
implementing targeted vacancy control as a tool to preserve existing lower rent
accommodation.
E. THAT Council direct staff to prepare and submit the following Homelessness

Minutes, Wednesday, February 26 and Tuesday, March 3, 2020 16
Emergency declaration and request for a plan, along with background
information (see below) as a resolution to the Lower Mainland Local Government
Association (LMLGA) and the Union of BC Municipalities (UBCM):
WHEREAS British Columbia has at least 7,655 homeless people, and
homelessness robs people of their security, dignity, rights and lives, as homeless
people have about half the life expectancy as housed people;
AND WHEREAS Bill C-97 (June 21, 2019) containing the National Housing
Strategy Act, and the federal right to housing legislation enshrines “adequate
housing as a fundamental human right.”
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
THAT the UBCM call upon the Province to declare a Homelessness Emergency
and work with all orders of governments, BC Housing and other partners on a
Homelessness Emergency Plan to build or find dignified, affordable housing for
at least 80 percent of counted homeless people within three years.
F. THAT Council direct staff to prepare and submit this Homelessness Emergency
declaration and request for a plan along with background information (see
below), as a resolution to the Federation of Canadian Municipalities (FCM):
WHEREAS Canada has at least 30,000 people who are homeless on any one
day with 235,000 experiencing homelessness in a year, and homelessness robs
people of their security, dignity, rights and lives, as homeless people have about
half the life expectancy as housed people;
AND WHEREAS Bill C-97 (June 21, 2019) containing the National Housing
Strategy Act, and the federal right to housing legislation enshrines “adequate
housing as a fundamental human right.”
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
THAT the FCM call upon the Federal Government to declare a Homelessness
Emergency and work with all orders of governments, and other partners on a
Homelessness Emergency Plan to build or find dignified, affordable housing for
at least 80 percent of counted homeless people within three years.
Background information
Declaring a Homelessness Emergency: Making an Emergency Plan to Drastically
Reduce Homelessness
From 2013–2016, the estimate of the number of Canadians experiencing homelessness rose
from 200,000 to 235,000. More recent federal data is not available, but growing counts in
Vancouver suggest that homelessness is on the rise across the country
( https://www.homelesshub.ca/sites/default/files/attachments/SOHC2013_execsummary_web.p
df 2016 report: https://homelesshub.ca/sites/default/files/SOHC16_final_20Oct2016.pdf ). In

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, February 26 and Tuesday, March 3, 2020 17
addition, most counts show that Indigenous comprise over one third of people who are
homeless, despite being only a tiny percentage of the population.
Studies have shown that people who are homeless have about half the life expectancy as
people with homes and that its cheaper to house homeless people than leave them on the
street. Local government agencies are often the first point of contact for concerns about people
being homeless in their area, or ask that something be done to help people who are homeless.
Local governments spend millions of property tax dollars on police, clean up services, homeless
services, and shelters because we have so much homelessness.
We haven’t always had a lot of homelessness in Canada. In the 1970’s when tens of thousands
of units of social housing were being built each year, and when welfare was high enough to pay
rent and eat, homelessness was much much lower, so low that it wasn’t even counted. It wasn’t
until the 1990s, when the federal government backed out of most housing programs and
stopped contributing half of province’s social assistance revenue, that homelessness began
escalating. We can’t allow ourselves to accept homelessness when it is doable to house
everyone who needs dignified housing, as the modular housing has shown. While local
governments feel the brunt of complaints about homelessness and while it’s our precious
residents who are suffering and homeless, local governments have one main source of
revenue, property tax, that is not progressive.
That’s why it’s so important that local governments unite on a call for a plan that will actually end
homelessness in a measurable way, with contributions from all orders of government that have
access to progressive taxation.
While homeless counts are not able to account for everyone who is actually homeless, they do
provide a way to measure whether or not we are making progress in ending homelessness. If
we count 7655 homeless people in BC in 2018 and, say 5000 in 2021, we’ll know that progress
is being made.
However if we count progress based on the number of new units constructed and don’t take into
account units lost to people who have low incomes because rents are going up or because new
people coming on social and disability assistance can’t afford rents, we won’t have an accurate
way of measuring progress on homelessness.
This motion calls for a plan that deals with the three main drivers of homelessness: lack of
decent affordable housing for people with low incomes, inadequate social and disability rates
(which provide a mere $375 a month for shelter), and loss of units due to rising rents. If all
orders of government act on these three homelessness drivers, we could see homeless
numbers falling soon.
Why did we pick reducing counted homelessness by 80% in three years? The 2018 provincial
allocation of 2000 modular housing units for the province could have worked wonders for
reducing homelessness if low social and disability rates and rising rents hadn’t increased the
demand for affordable housing units. One third of 80% of 7655 is about 2000, the number of
units of modular housing the province put in the budget for 2018, which is doable because it has
been done.
Now all we need is for the new units to be built, hopefully with contributions from all orders of
government and for changes in social and disability rates and restrictions on rising rents in low
income units. This resolution calls for us to unite in this call on all orders of government for an

homelessness.

THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. Cost is a significant barrier to people accessing contraception, particularly to
people with low incomes, youth, and people from marginalized communities;
2. Providing free prescription contraception has been shown to improve health
outcomes for parents and infants by reducing the risks associated with
unintended pregnancy, and is likely to reduce direct medical costs on the
provincial health system; and
3. Contraceptive methods targeted at men (such as condoms or vasectomies) are
available at low cost or are covered by BC’s Medical Services Plan, whereas
contraceptive methods for people with uteruses (such as birth control pills,
intra-uterine devices, or hormone injections) have high up-front costs, making
access to contraception unequal and gendered.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council directs the Mayor to urge the Provincial
Government to make all prescription contraception in BC available at no cost under the
Medical Services Plan.

MOVED by Councillor De Genova
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. On November 26, 2019, Council adopted a resolution directing staff to prepare a
report for consideration for referral to public hearing to amend the Rental
Housing Stock Official Development Plan to extend rental replacement
requirements to the C-2, C-2C, C-2B and C-2B-1 zoning districts;
2. The motion was moved and adopted without consulting land owners in these
zoning districts, and, if enacted, the proposed by-law will have significant impacts
on the land and development rights of these owners;
3. The Rental Housing Stock Official Development Plan already covers
approximately 80% of purpose-built rental housing in the City;
4. The C-2 zoning districts account for only 4% of purpose-built rental units in the
City, and the vast majority of these buildings are not rental apartments, but
include a few rental units above the commercial shops (e.g. units for shop
owners to live above businesses); and
5. There has been no net loss of rental units in the C-2 zones, but a net gain of 420
rental units in C-2 zoned areas over the last decade.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council rescind the resolution regarding
extending the Rental Housing Stock ODP to the C-2 zoning districts, adopted at the
November 26, 2019, meeting (Vote No. 05196);
FURTHER THAT Council direct staff to continue to monitor the rental housing stock in
C-2 areas, and report out on the overall net gain or loss of rental housing, and the
implementation of the TRPP and tracking of tenant impacts (eg. displacement due to
lack of right of first refusal) as part of the Annual Progress Report in Q2 of 2020.

Stock Official Development Plan to extend rental replacement requirements to

Prior to discussion on the above amendment, Councillor Boyle rose on a point of order to
inquire if the amendment was in order as it conflicts with the motion itself and it is frivolous as it
is an issue Council already voted on. Vice-Chair Fry sought advice from staff and the City
Manager and ruled the amendment out of order.

Councillor De Genova rose on a point of order to ask if her motion to rescind carried, would
Council then vote on the original amendment. Vice-Chair Fry consulted with staff and the City

Councillor Kirby-Yung rose on a point of order to ask if the motion could be amended.
The Vice-Chair consulted with staff and the City Manager and noted that it could be amended,

out of order earlier in the meeting. Following the Vice-Chairs ruling, the Vice-Chair again
consulted with staff and ruled instead that it is not possible to amend a motion to rescind.

At the Standing Committee on City Finance and Services meeting on February 26, 2020, the
Committee referred debate and decision on this item to the reconvened Council meeting
following the Standing Committee on City Finance and Services meeting on March 3, 2020.
MOVED by Councillor Fry
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. The area of Vancouver commonly referred to as the East Side: roughly and
generally-speaking Columbia Street to Victoria Drive and 1st Avenue to the
waterfront; is a distinct locality that supports a diverse ecosystem of residential,

Council
Minutes, Wednesday, February 26 and Tuesday, March 3, 2020 5
industrial, commercial, and cultural uses;
2. Of all major Canadian cities, Vancouver has the highest population of artists and
cultural workers (Hill Strategies: “Artist and Cultural Workers in Canadian
Municipalities” 2014). The highest concentration of artists in Vancouver are found
in the East Side, specifically postal region neighbourhoods V6A and V5L (Hill
Strategies: “Artists by Neighbourhood in Canada” 2005);
3. The Eastside Culture Crawl is an annual 4-day visual arts festival that involves
artists on Vancouver’s East Side opening their studios to the public, the event
serves to highlight and advocate the importance of the arts as a cultural and
economic driver for the region;
4. Since the Eastside Culture Crawl started in Strathcona in 1997, the event has
grown to include over 500 artists, crafts-people and designers, attracting an
audience of more than 45,000 people. Today, the Eastside Culture Crawl has
partnerships with a variety of local venues, galleries, studios and maker-spaces
and has become a prominent feature of the East Side’s cultural identity and
place-making;
5. The Eastside Culture Crawl Society recently reported that almost 400,000 square
feet of artist studio spaces have disappeared in the last 10 years in their
catchment. The Society’s 2019 “A City Without Art? No Net Loss, Plus!” report
also went on to document that of 1,612 artists with studios in the area, 1,332 face
an imminent threat of displacement due to future property development;
6. Vancouver’s 2019 Culture|Shift Strategy and Making Space for Arts and Culture
specifically identifies the need to secure affordable industrial spaces for arts and
culture; the insecure rental tenure coupled with an affordability crisis have
exacerbated the displacement of cultural spaces and artists;
7. Vancouver’s 2019 Culture|Shift Strategy and Making Space for Arts and Culture
Action 19 specifically identifies “cultural districts” along with density bonusing and
commercial linkage fees as a potential tool to prevent displacement and secure
spaces for affordable non-profit arts and cultural space in commercial and
industrial zones;
8. In its National Cultural Districts Exchange Toolkit Americans for the Arts (the US’
leading arts advocacy non-profit) describes the importance of cultural districts to
strengthen local economies, create an enhanced sense of place and deepen
local cultural capacity. The toolkit further advises the use of local partnerships
and consultants, engagement, planning, placemaking, and funding as
imperatives to developing and advancing a cultural district;
9. The official recognition of the Eastside Arts District along with policies and
dedicated funding would serve as a catalyst for building community identity,
tourism, and economic growth. (Eastside Culture Crawl Society: “A City Without
Art? No Net Loss, Plus!” 2019); and

b) (A) FURTHER THAT Council endorse that the Prior/Venables Street
underpass include an all-ages-and-abilities route for the Adanac Bikeway,
provide accessible walking connections, facilitate access to local
businesses via Raymur Avenue, and be integrated with public spaces and
an enjoyable public realm.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to report back on recommendations for the declaration
of an Eastside Arts District.
B. THAT Council direct staff to consult with the Eastside Culture Crawl Society, as
well as local artists, residents and businesses on scoping an Eastside Arts
District Strategy, complimentary to the report back on recommendations for the
declaration of an Eastside Arts District, and include:
i. Determining district boundaries and scale;
ii. Identifying resources, stakeholders and partners;
iii. Considerations around land use policy and regulatory frameworks;
iv. Look for potential sources of long term funding, programming and
sustainability, including but not limited to incentives, density bonusing and
partnerships.
C. THAT this Declaration and Strategy be developed in conjunction with existent
and ongoing work on the Vancouver Plan, Making Spaces for Arts and Culture,
Employment Lands and Economy Review and overlapping local area plans;
FURTHER THAT staff provide an interim report back on the declaration of an
Eastside Arts District as part of the larger culture plan update later this year.
D. THAT pursuant to Council direction from October 22, 2019, staff include planning
and implementation of an Eastside Arts District and Strategy as one of the
possible recommendations in a summary of capital investment priorities and
integration of public spaces and an enjoyable public realm.

Committee referred debate and decision on this item to the reconvened Council meeting
following the Standing Committee on City Finance and Services meeting on March 3, 2020.

Council
Minutes, Wednesday, February 26 and Tuesday, March 3, 2020 8
MOVED by Councillor Fry
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. The City of Vancouver Animal Control By-law, By-Law No. 9150, (“the By-law”)
establishes the pound with the ability to license and regulate dogs and other
animals:
a) The By-law defines “aggressive dog” to mean:
i. a dog with a known propensity, tendency, or disposition to attack
without provocation other domestic animals or human beings; or
ii. a dog which has bitten another domestic animal or human being
without provocation;
b) Section 4.3 of the By-law states that a person who keeps an “aggressive
dog” must not permit, suffer, or allow the dog to be on a street or other
public place or on any other property that such person does not own or
control unless such person has muzzled the dog to prevent it from biting
another animal or a person;
2. Under the authority of Section 324.1 of the Vancouver Charter an animal control
officer may opine that a dog is “dangerous;” and
a) An animal control officer is authorized to enter a premise with or
without a warrant and seize a “dangerous dog;” and
b) In addition to any other authority, if an animal control officer has
reasonable grounds to believe that a dog is a “dangerous dog”,
the officer may apply to the Provincial Court for an order that the
dog be destroyed in the manner specified in the order;
3. The By-law codifies the designation of “aggressive” dog as a life-sentence of
muzzling, restricted socialization, reduced exercise, and reduced training
opportunities, which is a detriment to both animal welfare and the long term
assurance of public safety;
4. The Vancouver Charter codifies the designation of “dangerous dog” as a death
sentence, unless the dog guardian is able to succeed in court to save the dog’s
life;
5. Muzzles, restricted socialization, and restricted off-leash opportunities are only a
part of a comprehensive strategy to adequately and humanely manage and
rehabilitate aggressive dogs;
6. Neither the By-law nor the Vancouver Charter distinguish between the various
reasons dogs can be aggressive, nor do these laws provide the potential to
recognize the prognosis of dogs. These laws also do not recognize that there are
different types of management and rehabilitation tools available to meet the

Council
Minutes, Wednesday, February 26 and Tuesday, March 3, 2020 9
needs of specific dogs;
7. Animal behaviourists identify at least a dozen underlying causes for aggressive
behaviour such as past trauma, fear, anxiety, inadequate socialization, medical
issues, resource-guarding, and others. Dogs can also bite because of prey drive;
8. Current evidence suggests that in many cases, positive reinforcement-based
behaviour modification techniques under the guidance of a qualified Animal
Behaviorist can be used to effectively rehabilitate and manage dogs labeled as
“aggressive” or “dangerous;”
9. Qualified Animal Behaviourists have earned a minimum MSc, or PhD in animal
behaviour, and typically work closely with veterinarians to provide expertise in:
a) behaviour modification, so they know the techniques that produce
changes in behavior;
b) the normal behaviour of the species they’re treating, so they can
recognize how and why an animal’s behavior is abnormal; and
c) teaching and counseling people, so they can effectively
understand and work with their pet;
10. The By-law does not specifically allow for appeal, relief or reversal of the
designation “aggressive dog” following successful behaviour modification;
however;
a) The Judicial Review Procedure Act does allow for appeal of
“aggressive dog” designation before a provincial court, however in
precedent setting Lee vs City of Vancouver and Cristofoli 2002
BSC 240 (paragraph 40) the Judge states that an aggressive dog
designation is not a “decision” subject to judicial review;
b) Other municipalities have developed an appeal process after an
aggressive designation has been issued. The City of New
Westminster allows the owner of an “aggressive dog” to apply to
the supervisor for relief from the requirements of the bylaw with
respect to aggressive dogs; after one year, no additional
complaints, and proof that the owner and the dog have
successfully completed a course by a recognized and accredited
institution or trainer to address the dog’s aggressive behaviour;
and
11. For the last 15 years, provincial court judges released “dangerous dogs” on
conditions pursuant to the Vancouver Charter. However, as result of a recent
B.C. Court of Appeal decision, this is no longer allowed. “Dangerous dogs” are
now at much greater risk of being euthanized instead of being given a chance to
be properly rehabilitated and managed.

Council
Minutes, Wednesday, February 26 and Tuesday, March 3, 2020 10
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT the designation of “dangerous” or “aggressive” dog and attendant
regulations can be an important tool for the protection of the public and other
animals.
B. THAT after working with a qualified professional Animal Behaviourist to assess
and modify the behaviour of a dog, a dog custodian should be allowed to apply
for a re-assessment and possible re-evaluation of an “aggressive dog” to the
satisfaction of and at no cost to the City of Vancouver Animal Control authority,
no less than one year after such a designation is made.
C. THAT prior to the final determination of an “aggressive dog” by authorized City
Official, a qualified Animal Behaviourist should be consulted to provide an opinion
on whether the dog is aggressive.
D. THAT Council direct staff to prepare appropriate legal language and present a
by-law change to allow relief of “aggressive dog” designation per resolution B.
E. THAT Council direct staff to prepare appropriate legal language and present a
by-law change to redefine the definition of “aggressive” such that an “aggressive
dog” is one that a qualified animal behaviourist believes is an aggressive dog,
after an assessment is done by that behaviourist and a full investigation is
conducted by the City’s animal control department, per resolution C.
F. THAT before any sections of the by-law are updated, staff report back with any
recommendations, and include considerations of other jurisdictions where
modernized, progressive animal control by-laws have been enacted, including
New Westminster, Coquitlam and Fraser Valley Regional District.
