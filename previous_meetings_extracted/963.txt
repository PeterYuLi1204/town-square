On February 27, 2019, the Committee heard from speakers and referred debate and decision on
this motion to the reconvened meeting on March 5, 2019. Due to time constraints, the matter was

MOVED by Councillor Fry
WHEREAS
1. On January 29, 2019, Vancouver City Council approved the technology for
a 7 km Broadway Subway Project extension to UBC: A Rail Rapid Transit
(RRT / SkyTrain) from Arbutus to UBC;
2. A condition of Vancouver City Council’s approval of the subway extension to UBC
was equitable transit oriented development that encourages creation of housing
options near transit with priority given to affordability;
3. The City has undertaken a number of policies, directives and by-laws, including:
a. In a measure to limit displacement, On April 17, 2007, Vancouver City
Council unanimously approved the Protection of Rental Housing Stock:
Rate of Change Regulations (April 5, 2007, VanRIMS No. 11-2200-21),
which mandates a one for one replacement of rental housing;
b. In a measure to limit speculation, On June 20, 2018, Vancouver City
Council approved the Broadway Planning Program: a two year planning
process to consider the surrounding land use for the 6 km route Millennium
Line Broadway Extension, from Clark Drive to Vine Street;
c. In a measure to encourage the development of rental housing, On
July 3, 2018, the Province of British Columbia passed the Residential
Rental Tenure Zoning Amendment Act: legislation that provides local
governments with a new authority to zone for residential rental tenure (i.e.
rental housing) in areas where multi-family residential use is permitted; and
enact zoning bylaws that require that new housing in residential areas be
developed as rental units; and ensure that existing areas of rental housing
are preserved as such;

November 14, 2018, Vancouver City Council unanimously passed a motion
directing staff to expedite the development of a city-wide plan;

2019.

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, February 27, March 5 and 6, 2019 25
4. Vancouver currently has an extremely low vacancy rate of 0.8% and Planning
Department staff have identified that there are approximately 30,000 older
affordable rental units along the Broadway corridor from Clark to Vine, and even
more from Vine to UBC;
5. Transit-oriented development leads the speculative real estate market in most
major North American metropolitan areas, especially and including Vancouver;
6. City staff have previously advised that “Land speculation can contribute to rising
land costs, impact housing and job space affordability, and hurt the City’s ability to
deliver affordable rental housing and provide community amenities to serve the
needs of our growing population.”; and
7. The potential for land speculation in the Arbutus to UBC Subway Extension
planning area poses a dangerous risk to the housing security of tens of thousands
of renting Vancouverites, requiring an emergency interim zoning policy.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to identify an Arbutus to UBC Subway Extension
planning area, along the new proposed potential route and surrounding proximity of
at least or close to 800 meters on either side to the north and south, except for the
MST-owned land area as identified in the concurrent Jericho Lands Policy Planning
Program.
B. THAT Council direct staff to explore the use of rental only zoning in the Broadway
Plan area and in the Arbutus to UBC Subway Extension planning area through the
Broadway Planning Process, the City-wide plan process or other robust,
collaborative and equitable planning processes to enhance the protection of
renters and limit speculation in response to transit infrastructure investment.
C. THAT Council direct staff to extend the Broadway Plan interim rezoning policy
(Policy on Consideration of Rezoning Applications and Heritage Revitalization
Agreements during the Broadway Planning Process) to the Arbutus to UBC
Subway Extension planning area, that generally rezonings will not be considered
while the planning process is underway, with the following exceptions:
a. Where, at the time of adoption of this rezoning policy, there is an active
rezoning application or where a recent application for rezoning advice has
been received, and the applicant has received a written response stating
that a rezoning application would be considered (within the past three
years), the application will be considered;
b. Rezoning applications will be considered for projects involving 100% social
and supportive housing, or community care facilities or group residences or
100% below market rental housing or 100% affordable student housing
associated with educational institutions; and

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, February 27, March 5 and 6, 2019 26
c. Rezoning applications which seek relief from any of the terms of this
rezoning policy may be considered under exceptional circumstances once
reported to Council for, at the discretion of the Director of Planning.
D. THAT Council direct staff to report back on a Development Cost Expectation (DCE)
policy for the Arbutus to UBC Subway Extension planning area.

FINAL MOTION AS APPROVED
WHEREAS
1. On January 29, 2019, Vancouver City Council approved the technology for a 7 km
Broadway Subway Project extension to UBC: A Rail Rapid Transit (RRT /
SkyTrain) from Arbutus to UBC;
2. A condition of Vancouver City Council’s approval of the subway extension to UBC
was equitable transit oriented development that encourages creation of housing
options near transit with priority given to affordability;
3. The City has undertaken a number of policies, directives and by-laws, including:
a. In a measure to limit displacement, on April 17, 2007, Vancouver City
Council unanimously approved the Protection of Rental Housing Stock:
Rate of Change Regulations (April 5, 2007, VanRIMS No. 11-2200-21),
which mandates a one for one replacement of rental housing;
b. In a measure to limit speculation, on June 20, 2018, Vancouver City
Council approved the Broadway Planning Program: a two year planning
process to consider the surrounding land use for the 6 km route Millennium
Line Broadway Extension, from Clark Drive to Vine Street;

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, February 27, March 5 and 6, 2019 32
c. In a measure to encourage the development of rental housing, on
July 3, 2018, the Province of British Columbia passed the Residential
Rental Tenure Zoning Amendment Act: legislation that provides local
governments with a new authority to zone for residential rental tenure
(i.e. rental housing) in areas where multi-family residential use is permitted;
and enact zoning bylaws that require that new housing in residential areas
be developed as rental units; and ensure that existing areas of rental
housing are preserved as such;
d. In a measure to engage a more robust public planning process, on
November 14, 2018, Vancouver City Council unanimously passed a motion
directing staff to expedite the development of a city-wide plan;

pros and cons of land value capture (LVC) mechanisms to collect on behalf
of the public a percentage of the land value wealth being created by City of
Vancouver decision making, and report back in July 2019.
4. Vancouver currently has an extremely low vacancy rate of 0.8% and Planning
Department staff have identified that there are approximately 30,000 older
affordable rental units along the Broadway corridor from Clark to Vine, and even
more from Vine to UBC;
5. Transit-oriented development leads the speculative real estate market in most
major North American metropolitan areas, especially and including Vancouver;
6. City staff have previously advised that “Land speculation can contribute to rising
land costs, impact housing and job space affordability, and hurt the City’s ability to
deliver affordable rental housing and provide community amenities to serve the
needs of our growing population.”;and
7. The potential for land speculation in the Arbutus to UBC Subway Extension
planning area poses a dangerous risk to the housing security of tens of thousands
of renting Vancouverites, requiring an emergency interim zoning policy.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council refer the Emergency Interim Zoning
Policy for Broadway Corridor motion as amended and as set out below, to staff on a
priority basis to report back to Council by the end of April 2019, with interim zoning policy

C. THAT Council direct staff to explore the implications of extending the
Broadway Plan interim rezoning policy (Policy on Consideration of

active rezoning application or where a recent application for
rezoning advice has been received, and the applicant has
received a written response stating that a rezoning application
would be considered (within the past three years), the
application will be considered;
b. Rezoning applications will be considered for projects involving
100% social and supportive housing, or community care facilities
or group residences or 100% below market rental housing or
100% affordable student housing associated with educational

City of Vancouver has an opportunity to apply for funding for major watershed and
greenway projects;
2. Metro Vancouver’s Integrated Liquid Waste and Resource Management Plan has a
target to eliminate combined sewer overflows (CSO) by 2050. Clark Drive CSO
pipes release over 10 million cubic meters a year of combined sewer overflow into
Burrard Inlet alone; this can be reduced with better watershed management;

average rainfall to be captured, infiltrated or treated, before discharge into the
marine environment, with only extreme storm events to rely on pipes and road-side
gutters;

number of residents who can access the shoreline within a 10 minute walk, which
is currently only 25%;
5. New local area plans, such as the Northeast False Creek Plan, establish high
standards for habitat creation and enhancement of biodiversity in marine and
intertidal zones to developed areas;
6. The Vancouver Park Board’s Biodiversity Strategy has a target to restore or
enhance 25 ha of natural areas by 2020 and emphasizes connecting habitats for
biodiversity such as through the daylighting of creeks. The Vancouver Park Board
is also working on a strategy to foster a greater understanding of past and present
use of local waterways, from pre- to post-colonization, and impacts on the future of
local waterways; and
7. Vancouver City Council unanimously approved on February 13, 2019, that staff
report back in Q3 of 2019 with recommendations from the Waterfront Initiative to
create an action plan to improve water quality. This includes restoring aquatic and
riparian ecology and traditional First Nation’s food sources along major natural
waterways, such as Burrard Inlet, False Creek, Lost Lagoon, Fraser River and
Trout Lake, by engaging with communities, industry, local First Nations, adjacent
municipalities, regional, provincial and federal governments.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to report back with a scope of
work to develop a comprehensive watershed management plan that includes:
i. Goals to recognize cultural importance and use of waterways, to increase
water quality and biodiversity, to naturalize waterways, to increase flood
and storm water management, to increase community access to
waterways, including the creation of surface water features, and to reduce
utility costs;

UNFINISHED BUSINESS
1. Canadian Pride in Vancouver’s Chinatown Memorial Square
On February 12, 2019, Vancouver City Council referred the motion below to the Standing
Committee on City Finance and Services meeting on February 13, 2019, to hear from speakers.
On February 13, 2019, the Committee heard from speakers and referred debate and decision to
the Regular Council meeting to be held on February 26, 2019, as Unfinished Business.
Subsequently, at the Regular Council meeting on February 26, 2019, due to time constraints,
Council referred the matter to the Regular Council meeting following the Standing Committee on
Policy and Strategic Priorities meeting on February 27, 2019, as Unfinished Business.
MOVED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
SECONDED by Councillor Hardwick
WHEREAS
1. At the November 1, 2017, Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic
Priorities meeting, City Council unanimously approved the Administrative Report
dated October 20, 2017, entitled: “Historical Discrimination Against Chinese
People in Vancouver”, including the following key actions:
i. Adoption of the “Preliminary Research on Historical Discrimination
Against Chinese People in Vancouver” report that provides context and
background for the initiative; and
ii. A request for a public acknowledgement and a formal apology for past
legislation, regulations and policies of previous Vancouver City Councils
that discriminated against residents of Chinese descent.
2. Recommendation #2 in the Historical Discrimination Report aims to Strengthen
Relations with the Chinese Canadian Community through Legacy Actions that
can confirm the values of a just and inclusive community;
3. The City of Vancouver values opportunities to celebrate our rich multiculturalism
through public arts, installations and events that instill civic pride. There is no
greater symbol of unity than the Canadian flag;
4. Council has previously provided support for a redesign of the Keefer Memorial
Square and reimagined it as a future gateway to Chinatown as part of a
UNESCO Heritage site application. Such a redesign is a number of years away
from completion;
5. An engaged community group wishes to create a legacy action through the
funding and installation of a flagpole at Chinatown Memorial Square that can
proudly fly the Canadian flag. The Vancouver Chinatown Lions Club is prepared
to underwrite the purchase and installation of a 30-foot flagpole, believing that
the display of this symbol of Canadian pride would complement the resident
statue that is dedicated to Chinese Canadian pioneers and veterans;

Regular Council
Minutes, February 27, and March 6, 2019 3
6. Installation of a flagpole would contribute to the continued work of building
connected communities that celebrate Vancouver’s cultural diversity, and
positively recognize the contributions of Chinese people to the history, fabric, and
success of our city and country;
7. The Vancouver Chinatown Lions Club will be celebrating its 65th anniversary in
2019 and sees an opportunity to bring the community together for a public
flag-raising event on May 5, 2019;
8. The initiative is supported by Pacific Unit 280 of the Army, Navy and Air Force
Veterans in Canada as well as the Chinese Canadian Military Museum Society;
9. Acceptance of funding to support the installation of a flagpole in partnership with
Vancouver’s Chinese community is a timely and significant gift opportunity.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council endorse the installation of a flagpole for flying the National Flag of
Canada at or in proximity to Chinatown Memorial Square through the acceptance
of a flagpole and support base gift from the Vancouver Chinatown Lions Club as
a symbol of unity and cross-cultural pride.
FURTHER THAT such acceptance be subject to review by Planning, Urban
Design and Sustainability; Arts, Culture and Community Services; External
Relations and Protocol; and Engineering Services staff.
B. THAT Council direct staff to discuss the potential for installation of a flagpole now
with a moveable base vs. the consideration of waiting for the installation as part
of the Memorial Square redesign.
C. THAT Council direct staff to prepare an estimate and funding model for ongoing
maintenance and any nighttime lighting costs.
D. THAT staff work with the donor, the City’s Chinatown Transformation planning
team, and Chinatown community organizations on flagpole siting options.

MOVED by Councillor De Genova
SECONDED by Councillor Dominato
WHEREAS
1. i) The City of Vancouver website, lists "Fighting" as a City of Vancouver
by-law fine;
ii) The City of Vancouver Street and Traffic By-Law No. 2849 section 69.A
states under the section titled "Fighting" that "A person must not fight or
engage in any other similar physical confrontation with one or more other
persons in, on, or near a street or other public place";
2. An overwhelming majority of fighting fines are issued in Vancouver's
Entertainment District and specifically, in the Granville Entertainment District
(GED). Issuing, enforcing and collecting unpaid fines under bylaw No. 2849
Section 69.A requires the Vancouver Police Department (VPD) and City of
Vancouver resources; and the cost is funded by taxpayers, residents and
businesses in the City of Vancouver;
3. Persons who are street homeless, individuals with no fixed address and
individuals challenged with debilitating mental illness are not among the
demographics typically issued fines for fighting under By-Law 2849 section 69.A
in Vancouver's Entertainment District;
4. Marginalized individuals are less likely to possess British Columbia Identification
(BCID), British Columbia Driver's Licenses (BCDL), and or motor vehicle
insurance. For this reason, they are less likely to be impacted by any fines or
penalties require payment, in advance of renewing identification or insurance;
5. The City of Vancouver and the VPD have no certainty that fines will be collected
for tickets issued for fighting under By-Law 2849 section 69.A;
6. There is general knowledge among people who receive fines for "fighting" under
By-Law 2849 section 69.A, that ramifications are minimal, and are not on the
same scale as tickets or fines issued under the Motor Vehicle Act (e.g. requiring
payment of outstanding fines as a condition of a renewing BCDL, BCID or car
insurance in British Columbia.);
7. Vancouver Police Department data shows that in 2015 (66%) and 2016 (64%) of
individuals who are the subject of police calls in Granville Entertainment District,
and were booked in the Vancouver Jail between Friday-Saturday nights between
10pm-4am and the early hours of Sunday morning reside outside of the City of
Vancouver.

Regular Council
Minutes, February 27, and March 6, 2019 7
8. Pursuing the payment of a fine issued for "fighting" in the Street and Traffic
By-Law No. 2849 Section 69.A may result in a greater cost to the City of
Vancouver if sent to collections, than revenue the fine would generate, if
collected;
9. The British Columbia Ministry of Public Safety and Solicitor General require
penalties and fines for an Immediate Roadside Prohibition (IRP) including
prohibition from driving for 3, 7 or 30 days in the case of a warn IRP, or for 90
days in the case of a fail or a refusal IRP, as outlined on a served IRP Notice of
Prohibition. Total costs also include driver license reinstatement fees and all
costs associated with a vehicle impoundment. Fees for review are $200 for an
oral review and $100 for a written review;
10. The British Columbia Ministry of Public Safety and Solicitor General require
penalties and fines for the use of an electronic device for communicating with
another person or another device by email or other text-based message, e.g.,
texting, emailing, talking or dialing. Fines are $368 and 4 penalty points. As of
March 1, 2018, drivers who have two or more distracted driving tickets in a
three-year period will pay a Driver Risk Premium (DRP) and could see their total
financial penalties rise to as much as $2,000 – an increase of $740 over the
existing penalties. This is in addition to their regular insurance premium, and all
fines must be paid before a driver's license and or car insurance will be renewed;
11. The City of Vancouver faces issues of affordability, homelessness and the City of
Vancouver operating budget annually faces increased costs for public safety, by
Vancouver residents, business and property owners;
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to consult with the
Vancouver Police Department and the Province of British Columbia, in the interest of
public safety to:
i. Consider policies or enact by-laws to help the City of Vancouver achieve
greater success collecting fines issued and/or recovering costs
associated with offences under By-Law 2849 section 69.A and other
related offences in the City of Vancouver Entertainment District.
ii. Consider the benefit of requesting amendments to provincial legislation,
that may require fines issued for fighting or similar offences to be paid
before the individual can:
• renew or purchase motor vehicle insurance in British Columbia
• renew British Columbia Driver's License (BCDL)
• renew British Columbia Identification (BCID)
iii. Explore the authority of the City of Vancouver to associate outstanding
fines for By-Law 2849 section 69.A and an individual’s credit rating.

Regular Council
Minutes, February 27, and March 6, 2019 8
FURTHER THAT staff report back to Council and present their findings and any
recommendations before the end of Q4 2019.

motion.
