Minutes, March 10, 2020 26
2. Taking Steps Towards a National Cost-shared Universal Healthy School Food
Program
MOVED by Councillor Bligh
SECONDED by Councillor Wiebe
WHEREAS
1. The City of Vancouver recognizes that access to sufficient, safe, nutritious, and
affordable food is fundamental to health and equality;
2. The Vancouver Food Charter, dating from January 2007, states that food is “a
basic human right” and that all residents need accessible, affordable, healthy,
and culturally appropriate food, with children in particular requiring adequate
amounts of nutritious food for normal growth and learning;
3. In January 2013, Vancouver City Council adopted the Vancouver Food Strategy,
an official plan and road map that integrates a full spectrum of urban food system
issues within a single policy framework that includes food production, food
processing, distribution, food access and food waste management, and builds on
years of food systems initiatives and grassroots community development that
considers all aspects of the food system. Vancouver's food strategy goals
express how the City wants the food system to take shape in the future;
4. In October 2014, Council adopted the Healthy City Strategy, which includes a
goal to ensure that Vancouver’s children and youth, up to age 24, have the best
chance of enjoying a healthy childhood;
5. In December 2014, Council unanimously adopted a motion asking City staff to
identify $400,000 in the City’s operating budget to expand access to healthy
foods for school-aged children. These funds enabled meal programs through
Vancouver School Board and the Strathcona Community Centre Association
between 2015 and 2018;
6. The Vancouver School District’s Food4School program, which was established in
2015/2016, received $222,895 from the City during that school year and received
$320,000 from the City in the 2016/2017 and 2017/2018 school years;
7. In June 2017, Council unanimously adopted a motion for submission to the Union
of BC Municipalities and the Federation of Canadian Municipalities (UBCM)
calling on UBCM to advocate for a Universal Healthy School Food Program to
the provincial and federal governments, in light of the ongoing fact that Canada is
one of the only industrialized countries without a national school meal program;
8. In September 2017, the City of Vancouver made a submission to the Federal
Government’s National Food Policy consultation process, noting the City’s
concern regarding increasing levels of food and income insecurity among
Vancouver residents and stating that “Individuals living with food insecurity report
poorer health, higher rates of obesity, poorer mental health and more mood and

Council Meeting
Minutes, March 10, 2020 27
anxiety disorders” as well as observing that health care costs are 76% higher for
individuals who are food insecure;
9. Among the City of Vancouver’s recommendations to the Federal Government’s
National Food Policy consultation in September 2017, there was a
recommendation for the Federal Government to work with the Provinces and
Territories to create a cost-shared universal healthy school food program to
ensure that all school children learn basic food skills and have access to healthy,
nutritious meals every day, in accordance with the view that school meal
programs not only benefit classroom learning, but also model healthy eating,
teach food skills, and serve to eliminate stigma through universality;
10. At the April 2018 Annual General Meeting of the BC School Trustees Association
(BCSTA), the membership passed a resolution calling on the BCSTA to, among
other things, “endorse the Coalition for Healthy School Food’s national Universal
Healthy School Food Program campaign” and for the “Ministry of Health and the
provincial Ministry of Health [to] provide new money to invest in a cost-shared
Universal Healthy School Food Program,” in recognition of the fact that ensuring
the life-long health and success of children and youth is proper nutrition and that
the establishment of healthy eating habits, along with the provision of appropriate
foods during a student’s developmental years, is critical to building not only a
base for success in school but a foundation for life-long health;
11. In addition to the BC School Trustees Association’s official endorsement of the
Coalition for Healthy School Food and its call for the development of a universal,
cost-shared School Food Program for Canada, numerous other organizations
have officially endorsed the Coalition and its call including the Vancouver District
Parent Advisory Council (DPAC), Family Services of Greater Vancouver, the
Federation of Canadian Municipalities, IUOE Local 963, and the City of Victoria
among others;
12. In 2018, the City of Vancouver proclaimed March 1, 2018, as “Great Big Crunch
for Healthy School Food Day” in Vancouver, and did so again in 2019. The Great
Big Crunch is a national movement and annual moment of anti-silence in which
students, teachers, parents and others passionate about food join the food
movement and crunch into apples (or other crunchy fruit or vegetable) to make
noise for healthy school food;
13. A September 18, 2018, staff report to Vancouver City Council entitled “City
Support for Healthy School Meal Programs” cites research showing that “every
student would benefit from access to a meal program, as these programs show
positive benefits not only on reducing school day hunger, but on improving
academic achievement, physical and mental well-being, and fruit and vegetable
consumption (Coalition for Healthy School Food, 2016). School meal programs
are also well placed to model systemic changes on environmental sustainability
and local agriculture through procurement practices”;

Council Meeting
Minutes, March 10, 2020 28
14. On March 19, 2019, Finance Minister Bill Morneau tabled Budget 2019 in which
the federal government committed to developing a “Food Policy for Canada” with
the intention to “set out a coordinated and collaborative approach to addressing
food-related issues” in Canada;
15. The federal government’s Food Policy for Canada initiative states that it is a
“roadmap for a healthier and more sustainable food system for Canada” that,
among other objectives, is taking the first consultative steps alongside provinces,
territories, and not-for-profit organizations towards the creation of a National
School Food Program, in order to help improve the health of Canada’s children
as they learn, leading to better futures for them, and ultimately for our country;
16. In September 2019, the Vancouver School Board (VSB) passed a motion
requesting that school district staff “create a holistic 10 Year Vision and Food
Framework for the District” with the work to include:
• a 10-year vision for the District that would include a Food Framework
incorporating relevant key components including but not limited to: food
growing, production, distribution, nutrition, waste, security, donations,
education, funding and lobbying that is in alignment with the District’s
Strategic Plan and budget;
• formation of a Food Working Group made up of external representatives;
• Identifying the capital and operating costs associated with developing a Food
Framework and its implementation.
17. In November 2019, a consultant’s report commissioned by VSB staff noted that
the Vancouver School District delivers 15 different nutrition programs at 119
sites, with operational oversight of seven teaching cafeterias, and management
of FoodSafe and regulatory compliance in 30 commercial kitchens;
18. The City of Vancouver 2020 Budget and Five-Year Financial Plan, under the
Department Service Plan for Arts, Culture and Community Services,
recommended “an increase of $160,000 to reinstate grants for the Vancouver
School Board school food program that were reduced in 2019” and further, under
the heading “Looking ahead, 2021-2024”, noted an objective to “Update the
Vancouver Food Strategy by developing priority food actions for 2021-2030 and
targets for 2050 for integration within the City’s next environmental plan.”;
19. “Thousands of hungry kids are fed every day in VSB schools, sometimes
breakfast, sometimes a hot lunch and sometimes a delivered meal. Those meals
are provided in 32 Vancouver schools in neighbourhoods identified as
vulnerable.” (Tracy Sherlock / Vancouver Courier – November 25, 2019);

Council Meeting

20. On February 13, 2020, Victoria City Council unanimously supported a motion
calling for the City of Victoria to “endorse the efforts of the Coalition for Healthy
School Food to advocate for a universal, cost-shared healthy school food
program…. based on a shared belief that all children and youth in British
Columbia should have daily access to healthy food at school.”;
21. The City of Vancouver has proclaimed March 12, 2020, as “The Great Big
Crunch for Healthy School Food Day” in the City of Vancouver (as in 2018 and
2019); and
22. The path to civic progress and a stable society – in Vancouver, throughout the
province of B.C., and across Canada – requires that we accept our social
responsibilities and act upon them, and although school meal programs cannot
address the root causes and totality of food insecurity, they do provide a stable
meal on school days to support student learning and are consistent with the
objectives of the City’s broader Food Strategy and the City’s Healthy City
Strategy.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Vancouver City Council direct the Mayor, on behalf of Council, to write to
the Prime Minister of Canada to encourage the Government of Canada to make
the creation of a Cost-Shared Universal Healthy School Food Program a top
priority for the national agenda of the 43rd Parliament in 2020, consistent with the
leadership already shown by the Government of Canada in working to create a
national food policy;
FURTHER THAT Council’s letter to the Prime Minister should reference the
City and Council’s strong support for the Federal Government to work with the
Provinces, Territories, Indigenous communities, and non-profit groups to create a
Cost-Shared Universal Healthy School Food Program that ensures all school
children learn basic food skills and have access to healthy, nutritious meals every
day to support classroom learning while also modelling healthy eating and
teaching food skills.
B. THAT Vancouver City Council call on the Provincial Government to commit to an
universal, cost-shared, healthy school food program for all K-12 students in BC,
including an invitation to all parties represented in the Provincial Legislature to
support a universal, cost-shared, healthy school food program, and to work with
local non-profits and school communities to pilot and implement a flexible
program that respects local conditions and food cultures, while promoting
positive health and education outcomes;
FURTHER THAT Council direct the Mayor, on behalf of Council, to write to the
Premier and the Provincial Ministers responsible for school food, namely the
Ministers of Education, Health, and Agriculture, to advise them of Council’s
endorsement and strong, ongoing support for an universal, cost-shared, healthy
school food program for all K-12 students in BC, including a reference to the

Council Meeting
Minutes, March 10, 2020 30
positive physical and mental health outcomes of universal meal programs as well
as the agricultural market opportunities through institutional local food
procurement which is a stated priority of Ministry of Agriculture.
C. THAT Vancouver City Council direct staff to report back to Council, prior to the
2021 City of Vancouver Budget deliberations, regarding the status of,
and funding requirements of, the Vancouver School District’s existing food
program(s) for the 2021/22 school year and that staff include
recommendations in their report for any transitional funding that may be required
from the City in support of these food program(s) should an Universal Healthy
School Food Program not yet be in place, and for
these transitional funding recommendations to be included in the City's
proposed 2021 Operating Budget;
FURTHER THAT Council direct staff to convey Council’s support and
encouragement to the School District for the creation of its “holistic 10 Year
Vision and Food Framework” and to note the opportunity for the City and the
School District to explore potential partnerships and alignments on shared
objectives relating to food, food security, and the fostering of healthy
communities within the city in the larger context of an anticipated Universal
Healthy School Food Program.
D. THAT Vancouver City Council and the City of Vancouver endorse the ongoing
efforts of the Coalition for Healthy School Food to advocate for a universal, cost-
shared healthy school food program based on the shared belief that all children
and youth in British Columbia should have daily access to healthy food at school.
E. THAT Vancouver City Council direct staff to work with their counterparts in other
B.C. municipalities in order to share data that may be relevant to
food matters and to support each other in advocacy efforts toward a universal,
cost-shared, healthy school food program.

4. Water and Washrooms as a Human Right
MOVED by Councillor Boyle
SECONDED by Councillor Wiebe
WHEREAS
1. Almost 2 billion people around the world do not have access to clean drinking
water, 4 billion people face severe water scarcity and 2.5 billion people do not
have adequate sanitation;
2. The United Nations’ World Water Development Report stated that, “3.6 billion
people live in areas that are water scarce for at least a month per year,” and if we
do not take action, it will “increase to as many as 5.7 billion people by 2050.”;
3. On July 28, 2010, the United Nations General Assembly passed Resolution
64/292 recognizing the human right to water and sanitation and acknowledged
that clean drinking water and sanitation are essential to the realization of all
human rights;
4. On September 23, 2010, the United Nations Human Rights Council passed
Resolution 16/2 which affirmed that the rights to water and sanitation are part of
existing international law and confirms that these rights are legally binding upon
States. It also calls upon States to develop appropriate tools and mechanisms to
achieve progressively the full realization of human rights obligations related to
access to safe drinking water and sanitation;
5. The climate crisis further threatens our water supplies through more frequent
droughts and increased water demands;
6. The effects of climate change are already being felt on Vancouver’s water
supply, including the severe drought of 2015 and the increasing variability of
Vancouver’s snowpack;
7. The manufacturing, transportation, and disposal of single-use bottled water has
serious environmental ramifications, particularly impacting air quality and the
climate, consumes unnecessary resources such as oil in the manufacturing of
plastic bottles and fuels used in the transportation of bottled water to the
consumer, and creates significant recycling and waste disposal costs;
8. The privatization of drinking water often results in the commodification of fresh
water, restricting communities’ rights to access drinking water while prioritizing
the profits of multinational corporations;

Council Meeting
Minutes, March 10, 2020 32
9. The problems associated with the privatization of multinational corporation’s
access to drinking water was exemplified in 2015 when in the midst of a drought
the interest of local communities were pitted against the interests of Nestlé’s
access to an aquifer outside Hope;
10. Additionally, the cost of single-use bottled water makes it less accessible to low-
income residents than public water fountains;
11. Public ownership and operation of drinking water and wastewater treatment
systems have been fundamental to access and quality over the past century;
12. On June 29, 2001, the Greater Vancouver Regional District decided against the
privatization of the operation of a water filtration plant on the grounds of potential
free-trade lawsuits;
13. Tap water in the City of Vancouver is safe, healthy and accessible to residents
and visitors, is readily available at most indoor public facilities, and is
substantially more sustainable than bottled water;
14. Vancouver has temporary fountains and water trucks which it rents or provides
during particularly hot stretches or outdoor events;
15. Vancouver Civic Theatres do not currently have bottle fill services in place,
relying on the sale of bottled water, or concession staff filling water bottles which
slows down service;
16. On April 7, 2015, in recognition of the 2015 UN World Water Day, the Vancouver
School Board passed a motion to phase out the sale of bottled water at VSB
schools and facilities, including the introduction of water refilling stations and the
sale of reusable water containers.
17. In 2009, the “Blue Communities” Project was developed to respond to the various
threats posed by the commodification and privatization of the world’s drinking
water;
18. In BC, a number of communities have protected their water supplies from
privatization and increased water rates, including Nanaimo, Victoria, North
Vancouver, Burnaby, Abbotsford, and White Rock;
19. In 2011, the Union of BC Municipalities passed a resolution supporting Blue
Communities;

Council Meeting
Minutes, March 10, 2020 33
20. To become a Blue Community, a municipality must recognize water as a human
right; ban the sales of bottled water in public facilities and at municipal events
and commit to promoting publicly financed, owned and operated water and
wastewater services;
21. A critical aspect of a human rights approach to water is ensuring safe and
accessible access to public washrooms, a particularly important requirement in
making a city welcoming for seniors, children, people with disabilities, and people
with unstable housing; and
22. The UN World Water Day will be observed on March 22, 2020, the day highlights
the importance of freshwater, and advocates for the sustainable management of
freshwater resources.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT the City of Vancouver endorses and supports the “Blue Communities”
project, and recognizes and affirms that access to water and sanitation services
are fundamental human rights.
B. THAT Council direct staff to prepare a report on the necessary policy and by-law
amendments required to align city services with a human rights centric approach
to water and sanitation services. Such a report should pay particular attention to:
a. Applying a human rights framework to its application of applicable
by-laws;
b. Providing an update on Council’s 2009 ban on the sale of bottled water in
municipal facilities and events, and a plan to phase out the sale of bottled
water, while increasing the availability of public water fountains and water
bottle filling stations;
c. Improving public access to washroom facilities, including advocating for
universally accessible washroom facilities in transit hubs and high-foot
traffic areas, and improved wayfinding signage and digital mapping; and
d. Considering relevant safety and accessibility concerns for Vancouver
residents most vulnerable to the opioid crisis.
C. THAT Council direct the Mayor to write to the Federal Government advocating
that they enshrine the human right to water and sanitation in federal law, and
advocating that they fulfill their responsibility to support municipal infrastructure
by investing in a national water and wastewater infrastructure fund that would

Council Meeting
Minutes, March 10, 2020 34
address the growing need to renew existing water and wastewater infrastructure
and build new systems, and further advocating that public infrastructure funding
only fund public projects.
D. THAT Council direct the Mayor to write to the Provincial Government advocating
that they enshrine the human right to water and sanitation in provincial law, and
advocate that the province stop issuing licenses to extract groundwater for
commercial water bottling and/or for bulk water exports.
E. THAT the City of Vancouver commit to promoting publicly owned, financed and
operated water and wastewater services, including opposing privatization in any
form of water and wastewater treatment services, including through public-private
partnerships or short-term service contracts, and resolve to keep these services
publicly financed, owned, operated and managed.

5. Safety for Residents with Precarious Status: Delivering Access without Fear
MOVED by Councillor Boyle
SECONDED by Councillor Swanson
WHEREAS
1. Vancouver has the second highest concentration of immigrants in Canada, and
migration to Vancouver is likely to increase due to global displacement caused by
climate change;
2. Many new residents arrive with temporary work permits that are tied to a single
employer; and are at risk of losing their status as a result of paperwork or
employer misconduct;
3. Vancouver residents deserve to feel confident in their safety using City services;
4. As San Francisco’s Sanctuary City Ordinance states, cities are safer for
everyone when:

Council Meeting
Minutes, March 10, 2020 35
all residents, regardless of immigration status, feel comfortable calling the
Police and Fire Departments . . . [and] accessing City public health
services and benefit programs;
5. In recognition of these conditions, Council adopted the Access to City Services
Without Fear (ACSWF) for Residents with Uncertain or No Immigration Status
policy in 2016, to enable “residents to use municipal services . . . without fear that
the City of Vancouver will ask for and provide information about their immigration
status to other institutions or orders of government unless required by law”;
6. Today, more than three years after the ACSWF policy was adopted, the policy
has not been fully implemented;
7. The ACSWF policy recognizes that:
a. “Immigration status is a social determinant of health”;
b. “Fear of harm, detention and deportation prevents people from seeking
the support they need from service groups and government agencies of
all types”;
c. “Women and children are especially affected when they cannot safely
access these supports, as partners, employers, and individuals are more
able to hold and abuse power over them”; and
d. “The voluntary disclosure of immigration status and enforcement of
immigration law is outside the scope of the City’s jurisdiction, and City
staff are not responsible for the enforcement of immigration law”;
8. Lack of safe and secure access to resources has and continues to result in an
atmosphere of fear, distrust, confusion, and even death for racialized,
undocumented, migrant, and refugee residents and communities in Vancouver:
a. Lucia Vega Jimenez, a 42-year Mexican hotel worker, died while in
Canadian Border Service Agency (CBSA)’s custody in December 2013
after being turned over to immigration authorities by Transit Police. In
2014, the community demanded an end to immigration detention, and a
Coroner’s Inquest identified various needed improvements within CBSA
correctional facilities. As part of their response, Transit Police ceased
their agreement with the CBSA; and
b. On August 19, 2019, CBSA raided the Hastings Racecourse because of
information provided by the BC Gaming Policy and Enforcement Branch.
Witnesses reported that CBSA staff harassed racialized employees
during the raid. CBSA arrested up to 26 employees, and at least seven
residents have since been ordered to leave Canada. It has been alleged
that a Gaming Policy and Enforcement employee falsified documents and
misled these residents; this employee was suspended with pay;

Council Meeting
Minutes, March 10, 2020 36
9. While there have been no reports made through the City’s processes,
communities have shared experiences of not being able to access City services
without fear in reports like Sanctuary Health’s 2018 “Still Waiting, Still Afraid:
Auditing Access Without Fear Policies in the City of Vancouver”;
10. Residents also report not being able to access City and civic services without
fear because different organizations funded by the City have inconsistent access
without fear policies;
11. These inconsistent policies and practices leave residents vulnerable to harm,
increase distrust, and prevent access to critical living, safety, emergency
housing, and community services. Staff awareness, training, and support is
essential to closing this gap and to ensuring that the ACSWF policy protects
residents when they access any front-line service;
12. Racialized residents are disproportionately criminalized and represented in the
justice system;
13. Dylan Mazur, lawyer with the BC Civil Liberties Association, was quoted in the
StarMetro Vancouver explaining that VPD’s guidelines were too unspecific to
offer guaranteed protection to undocumented people who wanted to come
forward as witnesses or victims of a crime:
“As a lawyer I cannot look at these guidelines and provide sound legal
advice whether someone should come forward as a victim . . . I am not
aware as a lawyer in what circumstances the Crown would require
someone’s immigration status for court process, or what specific offence
would require the disclosure of someone’s immigration status”;
14. In its 2019 “Update Regarding [VPD] Guidelines on Police Requests Related to
Immigration Status,” VPD reported having initiated an average of at least 23
queries per month to federal immigration authorities over an eight-month period
ending May 23, 2019;
15. As detailed in the 2016 ACSWF policy report, police departments in other cities
working to provide access without fear, including San Francisco and Los
Angeles, do not request or disclose information about the citizenship or migration
status of individuals unless required by law;
16. Residents deserve to be able to access emergency services for themselves and
their families without fear that they will be subjected to contact with correctional
or immigration enforcement systems;
17. Residents deserve regular, public updates about how the ACSWF policy is
proceeding so that they can make informed choices about accessing City
services; and
18. Council has an opportunity to demonstrate its leadership in supporting migrants’
safety by fully resourcing and implementing the policy it adopted, responding to

Council Meeting
Minutes, March 10, 2020 37
community calls for improvement, and urging other jurisdictions to follow suit—
especially around the core policy directive of “Relationship with CBSA”.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council recognize that a city where immigration status checks are only
performed when required by law would help create a city where residents, no
matter their immigration status, can truly access city and civic services, including
public safety services, without fear of deportation.
B. THAT Council direct staff to explore and report back in a public memo by the end
of Q2 2020, on work underway to finish implementing the 2016 policy (as
identified in the “Update: Access Without Fear Implementation” email and table
sent from the City Manager to Mayor and Council on January 29, 2020).
C. THAT Council direct staff to incorporate the following into the work to finish
implementing the 2016 policy:
i. For implementation of initiative #3, staff and community training:
Maintaining annual policy training for department leaders and training for
relevant front-line staff, including VPD statistics on immigration status
checks and collaboration with the CBSA;
ii. For implementation of initiative #4, communication strategy: Supporting
community groups that serve undocumented residents to develop
resources and/or workshops for migrants on the policy and how it affects
their access to services; and
iii. For implementation of initiative #6, “Reporting and Evaluation”: Providing
an annual, public progress update at a Council meeting.
D. THAT Council direct staff to explore and report back by the end of 2020 with a
budget and timeline for options to strengthen the Access to City Services Without
Fear (ACSWF) policy and guidelines in 2021, including Identifying and
recommending any necessary or additional resources, such as staffing or
additional funding for new initiatives, in order to fully implement or strengthen the
ACSWF policy and to adopt best practices from sanctuary cities (e.g. providing
City ID cards, legal advice, etc.).
i. Amending City of Vancouver grant eligibility requirements to read: “Be
accommodating, welcoming and open to people of all . . . migration
status, and socio-economic conditions, in their policies, practices and
programs”;
ii. Mandating migrant rights training for staff as part of the business licence
approval process; and
iii. Inviting input from relevant advisory committees.

E. THAT Council direct the Mayor to write to BC Housing to urge them to require

that they maintain privacy of information related to access without fear policies.
F. THAT Council direct the Mayor to write to the Vancouver Police Board, VPD’s
Chief Constable, and VPD’s senior management to share this motion.
G. THAT Council direct the Mayor to write to BC’s Premier, Attorney General, and
Ministers of Education, Health, and Labour to share this motion, to outline the
impacts of the August CBSA raid for Vancouver’s communities, and to ask that
the province join the City of Vancouver and other municipalities by developing
access without fear policies with an emphasis on healthcare, education, and
employment standards.
H. THAT Council direct the Mayor to write to the federal Minister of Public Safety by
April 15th to share this motion, to outline the impacts of the August CBSA raid for
Vancouver’s communities, and to ask that the CBSA revisit its investigation
practices, particularly when there is no public safety risk and when working with
racialized, marginalized, or vulnerable communities.

4. The City of Portland became the first Salmon-Safe city in North America on
October 26, 2016, when Portland City Council accepted the findings of the
Salmon-Safe science team's third-party assessment of city operations, along with
specific commitments to improve operations and prioritize capital investments
across bureaus. The Mayor of Portland sent a challenge for Vancouver to work
towards certification as well;
5. The City of Vancouver’s Greenest City 2020 Action Plan has a priority action to
develop and implement enhanced water education, incentive and conservation
programs while increasing our natural spaces to provide homes for millions of
organisms that help filter pollutants form our air and water;
6. Council has adopted the target that restoration work will be completed on enough
forest and coastal ecosystems in Vancouver and the surrounding region to
remove one million tonnes of carbon pollution annually by 2030;
7. The Vancouver Park Board’s Biodiversity Strategy has a target to restore or
enhance 25ha of natural areas by 2020 with an emphasis on connecting habitats

8. Strengthening Representative Democratic Practices in the City of Vancouver
MOVED by Councillor Hardwick
SECONDED by Councillor Carr
WHEREAS
1. “Trust in government has been identified as one of the most important
foundations upon which the legitimacy and sustainability of political systems are
built. Trust is essential for social cohesion and well-being as it affects
governments’ ability to govern and enables them to act without having to resort to
coercion.” (Government at a Glance 2013 - OECD);2
2. In British Columbia, legislation empowers, guides, limits, and affects local
governments. The Community Charter and the Local Government Act define the
core authority of local governments and guide decision-making, with the City of
Vancouver served by its own legislation, namely, the Vancouver Charter which
sets out the key local government powers and responsibilities of the City of
Vancouver along with the corresponding powers and responsibilities of the City’s
elected officials;
3. Although the Province’s Community Charter does not specifically apply to the
City of Vancouver, save for those sections noted in section 2.1 (2) of the
Vancouver Charter, the Community Charter does outline commonly understood
principles of municipal governance, and states, under section 1, that
“Municipalities and their councils are recognized as an order of government
within their jurisdiction that;
● (a) is democratically elected, autonomous, responsible and accountable,
● (b) is established and continued by the will of the residents of their
communities, and;
● (c) provides for the municipal purposes of their communities.”;
4. Geographically, the City of Vancouver is located on the western half of the
Burrard Peninsula and nominally bounded to the north by English Bay and
Burrard Inlet, to the south by the Fraser River, to the west by the Strait of
Georgia, and to the east by Boundary Road;3
2 Government at a Glance is published every two years by the OECD. It provides indicators that compare the political and
institutional frameworks of government across OECD countries. https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/governance/government-at-a-

3 As the largest city in British Columbia, and the eighth largest municipality in Canada, Vancouver covers 114 square kilometres (44
square miles) of land area with a population of 631,486 (2016 census). The City of Vancouver is distinct from the Greater Vancouver
metropolitan area which includes the City of Vancouver as well as neighbouring municipalities such as Burnaby, Richmond, and
Surrey. City of Vancouver — corporation and boundaries:

Council Meeting
Minutes, March 10, 2020 45
5. Municipal councils in British Columbia typically have full discretion to set policies,
adopt bylaws, and establish direction for their communities, in accordance with
legislation and other legal rules, and they do so within the established principles
and traditions of representative democracy and consistent with the Canadian
democratic tradition;4
6. In a representative democracy, all eligible citizens have the right to participate,
either directly or indirectly, in making the decisions that affect them, most
commonly by voting in an election and/or by making their views known to their
elected officials on issues of importance to them and their community, for
example, at Public Hearings of Council;5
7. As a representative democracy under the laws and traditions of Canada, the
fundamental principles of representative democracy apply to the City of
Vancouver, its elected Council, and the various legislative processes conducted
by Council and the City on behalf of the city’s constituents and within the City’s
jurisdictional and physical boundaries;
8. To be effective stewards of the City and best represent constituents, members of
a City Council must receive and consider feedback representing a wide range of
views obtained through a variety of means and processes. Specifically:
● in person (e.g. at public hearings and from delegations to Council)
● on paper (e.g. letters, petitions)
● online (e.g. emails, online petitions, social media)
9. Public Hearings are a quasi-judicial process of Council where, at the start of a
public hearing, the City Clerk reads a summary of the application under
consideration along with a summary of correspondence received. For example,
the Clerk’s opening statement variously takes the form of, “The following
correspondence has been received since referral to Public Hearing and prior to
the close of the speakers list and receipt of public comments: x pieces of
4 The City of Vancouver, as with other municipalities in British Columbia, is empowered to control land use and development within
the city through a variety of processes and tools, and is also responsible for providing essential municipal infrastructure and services
including drinking water, roads, fire protection, and sewage collection and treatment.
https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/local-governments/facts-framework/systems/municipalities?keyword=municipal
5 Sections 22 through 24 of the Vancouver Charter, under Division 5 (Electors), specifies the eligibility criteria for “resident electors”
(i.e., those who live in the city) and “non-resident property electors” (i.e., the registered owner of real property in the city) to vote in a
City of Vancouver election, all of whom must be, among other requirements and restrictions, 18 years of age or older on the day of
registration or on the general voting day for the election, a Canadian citizen, and a resident of British Columbia for at least 6 months
immediately before the day of registration or on the general voting day for the election.
Section 38 of the Vancouver Charter under Division 5 (Qualifications for Office) lays out the requirements that must be met for
holding office on Council or Park Board and states, among other criteria, that the person “must be an individual who is, or who will
be on general voting day for the election, 18 years of age or older,” a Canadian citizen, and “must have been a resident of British
Columbia, as determined in accordance with section 25 [of the Charter], for at least 6 months immediately before the relevant time.”

Council Meeting
Minutes, March 10, 2020 46
correspondence in support and x pieces of correspondence in opposition. This
represents all correspondence up to 5:00 pm today.”;
10. The summary of correspondence presented at Public Hearings and for other
Council processes is intended to quantify and convey the level of support or
opposition to a matter under consideration. Council is reliant on the quality and
reliability of the summary information to ensure that the decision making process
is sound and sufficiently representative in its scope;
11. Those persons wishing to address Vancouver City Council on a matter, either as
a delegation to Council or at a Public Hearing, including through written
correspondence, are currently not required to indicate or state where they live in
the city, what their home address may be, or whether they may in fact reside in
another municipality altogether;
12. A cursory review of the practices and procedures in place for neighbouring
municipalities, such as Surrey, Burnaby, West Vancouver, and New
Westminster, indicates that those persons wishing to address a Council, either in
written correspondence, as a delegation, or at a Public Hearing, are required to
indicate or state where they live in the city or whether they may in fact reside in
another municipality or neighbourhood altogether. This information is considered
to be relevant to a Council’s consideration of a matter and the information is fully
protected by provincial privacy regulations and requirements;
13. The optional disclosure of residency seen in Vancouver’s practices and
procedures is not consistent nor in alignment with the practices and procedures
seen in neighbouring municipalities where residency information is considered to
be relevant to a Council’s consideration of a matter;
14. Section 566 (4) of the Vancouver Charter relative to Public Hearings (Division (3)
- Zoning: Amendment or repeal of zoning by-law) specifically states that “At
the hearing all persons who deem themselves affected by the proposed by-law
shall be afforded an opportunity to be heard in matters contained in the proposed
by-law….” The Local Government Act contains similar language in section 465
(2): “At the public hearing, all persons who believe that their interest in property is
affected by the proposed bylaw must be afforded a reasonable opportunity to be
heard or to present written submissions respecting matters contained in the
bylaw that is the subject of the hearing.”;
15. In order to ensure that constituent and community feedback is fully, fairly, and
transparently articulated and considered, it is incumbent in a representative
democracy to ensure that the will of the people, as expressed by its constituents
through the various feedback mechanisms and processes in place, is accurately
and fairly presented;

Council Meeting
Minutes, March 10, 2020 47
16. The City of Vancouver has a Local Improvements Program (LIP) whereby
property owners who request improvements in their local area do so through a
petition process that includes a certification requirement (see:
https://vancouver.ca/streets-transportation/construction-and-improvements.aspx).
The LIP certification and authentication procedures and processes enable
eligible citizens to participate directly in making decisions that affect them. Under
the LIP program, a successful petition requires that at least two-thirds (2/3) of the
total number of owners sign the petition and that those properties supporting the
project must represent at least one-half (1/2) of the total value of the properties
affected. These are the minimum requirements as per Section 509 of the
Vancouver Charter;
17. The personal information required by the LIP petition process is collected under
the authority of, and used for the purpose of, administering the local improvement
process under the Vancouver Charter. The Local Improvement Office provides
access to a petition to any affected property owner upon request. For privacy
reasons, a petition is not released to anyone else except as authorized under the
Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act;
18. The City of Vancouver has a variety of tools to certify and/or verify the residency
status of persons who register to appear as a delegation at Council, speak at a
Public Hearing, sign a petition, or submit their thoughts and views through
various written forms of correspondence. These tools include the City’s list of
resident and non-resident property electors, property tax information, permits and
permit applications, and other information sources that the City and relevant City
staff have legitimate routine access to (in accordance with all legislated privacy
provisions).
19. The certification and authentication procedures and processes in place for the
City’s LIP program offer a standard and provide a model for transparently
enabling eligible citizens to participate directly in making decisions that affect
them and/or their neighbourhood. It stands in contrast to the non-transparent,
optional standard currently applied by the City for those wishing to address
Council, either in written form, as a delegation to Council, or by speaking at a
Public Hearing; and
20. A requirement to indicate or state where one lives in the city, or whether one may
in fact reside in another municipality or neighbourhood altogether, when
addressing Council does not preclude the full of that person’s full participation in
a civic process and nor does it mean that the information, feedback, and
perspectives presented and/or received are not relevant or germane. Simply, a
transparent sense of a person’s interest in a matter or how it affects them
personally and specifically is an important factor among many that elected
officials must consider in course of a fully informed, transparent, and democratic
decision making process.

Council Meeting
Minutes, March 10, 2020 48
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Vancouver City Council direct staff to review the
City’s current practices and procedures for gathering public feedback, and reporting
same to Council, with an emphasis on identifying ways to strengthen public trust in the
City’s procedures and practices as a representative democracy, and for staff’s review to
include proposals and recommendations for the consideration of Council for establishing
and/or certifying the residency of persons who seek to address Council, either as a
delegation to Council, at a Public Hearing, or through written correspondence, toward
greater transparency and to ensure that constituent and other feedback to Council –
whether that feedback is received in person, on paper, or online – is fully, fairly, and
transparently presented to Council, in accordance with the established principles of
representative democracy, as well as the City’s mandate under the Vancouver Charter
to ensure that the will of the people from within the City’s jurisdictional and physical
boundaries, as expressed through various feedback mechanisms and processes, is
accurately and fairly presented;
FURTHER THAT staff be directed to report back to Council by the end of Q2 with
protocols and procedures for a certification/verification system for Council’s approval, as
noted above, including (but not limited to) recommendations reflective of the following
certification and verification standards and objectives:
1. In person:
● A requirement for those addressing Council, either at a Public Hearing or as a
delegation to Council, to be certified and/or verified through an appropriate
mechanism while protecting individual privacy.
● A requirement for those addressing Council, either at a Public Hearing or as a
delegation to Council, to transparently indicate or state their status as a resident
or non-resident of the city, or of a specific neighbourhood relevant to any matter
under consideration.
● A supplementary requirement/opportunity for those addressing Council, either at
a Public Hearing or as a delegation to Council, to indicate or state their interest in
a matter, how they may be personally affected, whether they are or plan to be a
business owner or operator with an interest in a matter, whether they have a
commercial or other interest in a matter, or whether they represent a group or
organization with an interest in a matter in addition to indicating or stating their
status as a resident or non-resident of the city or that of a specific neighbourhood
relevant to a matter under consideration.
● A requirement for those addressing Council to state whether they are in support
or opposition to the issue under review, to be tabulated in a final review and the
minutes of the meeting.
2. On paper:
● A requirement that all paper-based correspondence be certified and/or verified
through an appropriate mechanism.
● A requirement that tabulations of received correspondence presented to Council
which indicate numbers of those IN SUPPORT of or IN OPPOSITION to a matter
reflect the total numbers of certified/verified signatories – for and against – to
provide a fair, accurate, and transparent gauge of support and/or non-support.

Council Meeting
Minutes, March 10, 2020 49
For example, petitions should not be presented as a single piece of
correspondence, but rather should reflect the total number of certified/verified
signatories.
● A requirement that correspondence by individuals or groups be examined with
the intent to provide a more accurate representation of the number of people
actually represented.
● A requirement that all addresses, names, and signatures on petitions be certified
and/or verified, potentially by cross-referencing with the City’s list of electors
and/or other records, such as property and tax records accessible by the City
and relevant City staff (and in accordance with all legislated privacy provisions),
prior to a petition being presented to Council. Verification of petitions is already
the case for the City’s Local Improvements Program whereby property owners
who request improvements in their local area do so through a petition process
that includes certification (see: https://vancouver.ca/streets-
transportation/construction-and-improvements.aspx).
3. Online:
● A requirement that all online correspondence be certified and/or verified through
an appropriate mechanism such as digital identity authentication and privacy by
design principles.
● A requirement that City e-forms and correspondence forms establish and/or
certify the residency of persons who seek to contribute feedback to Council (e.g.
https://vancouver.ca/your-government/contact-council.aspx).
4. Reporting:
● The various Council Feedback reports produced daily, weekly and monthly be
updated to present a more complete, accurate and authentic representation of
the input of Vancouverites.

9. Supporting Gender Equity and Diversity in Vancouver City Council
MOVED by Mayor Stewart
SECONDED by Councillor Carr
WHEREAS
1. Legislative bodies, including Vancouver City Council, are workplaces that reflect
the power structures and gender dynamics of the past through their operational
practices and legislative frameworks;
2. Legislative workplaces should be family-friendly environments for all workers -
including elected and non-elected staff - so that their needs to live as well as
work are taken into account;
3. Legislative workplaces that embody and promote gender equity and diversity
deliver better to constituents and are more legitimate;
4. Many legislative workplaces that are working to move away from male-dominated
membership towards promoting equity acknowledge barriers that deter diversity
and hinder progress towards equality, and then take strong action to address
these issues;
5. The United Nations Inter-Parliamentary Union recommends undertaking an audit
of legislative bodies to identify shortcomings in the processes and structures of
democratic governments, and have developed tools to use in this audit, most
notably the 2012 “Plan of Action for Gender-Sensitive Parliaments”;
6. For the first time in Vancouver’s history, over 70% of Council members are
women, and a large proportion of the non-elected staff working for council are
also women;
7. Women in elected and other public positions report higher levels of harassment
and sexual harassment;
8. Workplace conditions, such as hours of work and access to childcare, can
promote or hinder participation in elected democracies; and
9. A gender and diversity audit of Vancouver City Council and its representation,
infrastructure, and political and legislative frameworks has never been
undertaken.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff in the City Clerk’s Office to
establish an annual Gender and Diversity Audit to examine representation,
infrastructure, operations, and legislative frameworks related to Vancouver City Council

11. Public Amenities and Equity in DCL-Waiver and Rental Re-Zoning Hot-Zones
MOVED by Councillor Fry
SECONDED by Councillor Carr
WHEREAS
1. Most new development in the City of Vancouver pays Development Cost Levies
(DCLs). A DCL is paid by property developers based on square footage. DCLs
are an important source of revenue for City facilities such as:
a. Parks
b. Childcare facilities
c. Social and non-profit housing
d. Engineering infrastructure
2. Community Amenity Contributions (CACs) are in-kind or cash contributions
provided by property developers when City Council grants development rights
through rezoning. CACs help the City build and expand facilities like:
a. Affordable housing
b. Parks and open spaces
c. Childcare facilities
d. Community facilities (example: community centres and libraries)
e. Transportation and public realm
f. Arts and culture spaces
3. City Planning and Development Services staff perform comprehensive updates
to DCLs and CACs every 4 years in advance of each 4-year Capital Plan in

Council Meeting
Minutes, March 10, 2020 57
alignment with provincial best practices. The updates, which are approved by
Council, include a comprehensive review and update including:
a. City-wide population and job growth projections;
b. Identifying capital costs for corresponding DCL/CAC-eligible public
amenities and infrastructure;
c. Review DCL waivers, reductions and exemptions and review CAC
exemptions;
d. Determining DCL/CAC allocations and rates; and
e. Establishing updated by-laws for DCLs and updated CAC Targets;
4. To address low vacancy rates and a need for rental tenure housing, the City of
Vancouver incentivizes the building of new purpose-built rental housing in certain
circumstances through a variety of programs and policies that variously exempt
CACs on re-zoning and/or waive DCLs on new development;
5. The City also does annual reports on DCLs (as per the requirement in the
Vancouver Charter) detailing all projects that received waivers, reductions and
exemptions in the previous year. This data is found in the Annual Report on
DCLs which has been produced since 2010. Each annual report has a detailed
list of each DCL waiver/exemption approved by year, including key information
such as: project address, number of rental/social housing units
waived/exempted, and foregone DCL revenue;
6. From 2010 to 2018, the City of Vancouver granted DCL waivers to a total of 36
projects, representing 3702 rental units. The DCL waiver value over that period
was $23,946,616;
7. Considering additional 2019 approvals not referenced in (6), there appears a
predominant trend of DCL waivers and concurrent additional density in East
Vancouver, notably Kensington, Cedar Cottage and DTES;
8. Anticipating additional DCL waiver projects in the pipeline sees distinct “hot-
zones” emerging, for instance Cedar Cottage: Commercial, Kingsway area;
9. Residents of these DCL waiver hot-zones have variously remarked at public
hearings about addressing costs of growth and density: specifically but not
limited to traffic and traffic calming, public amenities, park spaces;
10. DCL Waivers/Exemptions were last reviewed comprehensively in 2017. They are
scheduled to be reviewed again as part of the next comprehensive update in
2021;
11. The public benefit created by adding new purpose built market or otherwise
rental housing does not negate the need for additional public benefits to support

Minutes, March 10, 2020 58
growth and new density; and
12. The City of Vancouver has four DCL areas, the City-wide DCL makes up the
largest of these areas. DCLs collected within each district must be spent within
the area boundary, except housing related DCLs which can be spent anywhere
in the city.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council affirms that public benefits accrued as a result of growth contribute
to the city’s livability.
B. THAT Council affirms equitable and timely distribution of public benefits in the
City of Vancouver should be commensurate to the addition of new density
regardless of ownership, strata or rental tenure.
C. THAT Council direct staff to map the list of waivers/exemptions relative to
demonstrated and projected public benefit needs, in order to further illustrate
where waivers occur in the city relative to where benefits may be needed as part
the next (2021) Annual Report on DCLs.
D. THAT Council direct staff to begin as soon as possible or by Q1 2021 on all new
applications receiving CAC exemption or DCL waivers, including in writing with
any report/recommendation the specific documentation of:
a. the extent of nearby growth and projected growth, other proximate
projects receiving exemptions or waivers;
b. any identified public benefit needs as applicable, including but not limited
to parks, traffic-calming, infrastructure, and placemaking; and
c. any identified public benefit needs that may fall outside the direct purview
of city’s benefits strategy like community serving spaces and schools.
E. THAT Council direct staff to report back on a strategy whereby CAC-
exempt/DCL-waived hot zones could be considered for a timely, targeted public
benefit strategy, notwithstanding the city-wide DCL policy or four-year capital
planning exercises, and that this strategy:
a. be done in such a way as to inform the Vancouver Plan process; and
b. be inclusive of but not limited to public engagement, the public hearing
process, and consider the participatory budget process should council
chose to continue with this pilot.
