UNFINISHED BUSINESS
1. Community-based Crisis Management Through Understanding and De-escalation
At the June 24, 2020, Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities, Council
referred (postponed) the member motion, “Community-based Crisis Management Through
Understanding and De-escalation”, to a Council meeting after the Provincial review of the Police
Act Terms of Reference had been established and made public.
The conditions of the above-noted referral have been met as the Provincial review of the Police
Act Terms of Reference has been completed and made public. As such, this item has been
scheduled as Unfinished Business on the January 25, 2022, Council meeting agenda.
Prior to debate on the item Councillor De Genova rose to declare a conflict of interest, out of an
abundance of caution, as she has a close family member who is a sworn officer of the
Vancouver Police Department. Councillor De Genova left the meeting 10:16 am and did not
return until the beginning of the next item.

Council Meeting
Minutes, January 25, 2022 5
MOVED by Councillor Fry
SECONDED by Councillor Dominato
WHEREAS
1. Jane Jacobs famously posited: “The public peace—the sidewalk and street
peace—of cities is not kept primarily by the police, necessary as police are. It is
kept primarily by an intricate, almost unconscious, network of voluntary controls
and standards among the people themselves, and enforced by the people
themselves.”; 1
2. The public peace can be challenged in particular through confrontation between
businesses and residents with street entrenched and people experiencing
homelessness. Concerns around crime and safety, neighbourhood decline, and
chronic street nuisance result in higher volumes of reactive police and
non-emergency calls, requests for more security, and compassion fatigue;
3. Street entrenched and homeless people have often experienced traumas
including intergenerational and childhood trauma; sexual and physical
victimization; physical and/or mental health challenges and addictions;
compounded by the trauma of experiencing homelessness, social isolation or
living in substandard housing; 2
4. In 2014, Vancouver City Council adopted the Caring for All Report 3 with a call to
action to support and advocate for safe and inclusive communities for all
residents:
“By making use of its full range of social development tools, from advocacy to
direct services, the City is well positioned to support partnerships to help
transform existing services and approaches in the arena of mental health and
addictions.”
5. In 2014, Vancouver City Council adopted A Healthy City For All strategy 4 with a
focus under Healthy Communities - Cultivating Connections, to:
“Examine regulations, policies, and processes that affect our relationships with
and between residents - past, present and future.”
6. The B.C. Ministry of Mental Health and Addictions’ ten-year mandate: A Pathway
to Hope (2017) 5, lays out a roadmap for making mental health and addictions
care better for people in British Columbia. The vision noted that B.C. has the
country’s highest rate of hospitalization due to mental illness and substance use;
and called for new collaborative partnerships with other stakeholders, highlighting
that:
“Stigma and affordability stand out as substantial systemic barriers to care. Fear
and misunderstanding often lead to prejudice against people with mental illness,
substance use and addiction challenges.”

Council Meeting
Minutes, January 25, 2022 6
7. Vancouver is at the centre of a mental health and addictions crisis, and as priority
actions the City of Vancouver 6 is working to:
a. promote healthy families and communities and protect child development;
b. make sure individuals have access to services that help them lead
healthier lives;
c. reduce the spread of deadly communicable diseases, and prevent drug
overdose deaths; and
d. recognize the need for peace and quiet, public order, and safety;
8. The 2016 Vancouver Police Mental Health Strategy 7 reports increasing
incidences of police interactions with people living with mental illness and often
struggling with substance abuse, that may not be receiving necessary medical
care and community support. The Strategy recognizes that some of these people
may be in a state of crisis, and includes a continuum of discretionary de-
escalation techniques including non-engagement, disengagement, and delaying
custody before proceeding with apprehension under the Mental Health Act or
arrest, with the caveat:
“History has shown that police interactions with persons living with mental illness,
and who are in crisis, sometimes have the potential for violence. Occasionally,
the mere presence of the police can elevate the tenor of the interactions and
complicate communication further.”
9. According to the B.C. Police Act 8, Vancouver “must bear the expenses
necessary to generally maintain law and order in the municipality.”;
10. Recent campaigns to reallocate police funding have highlighted that in
Vancouver, poverty, unstable housing, and mental health and addictions issues
represent decades of underfunding and gaps in provincial programming that has
resulted in increased policing;
11. On June 12, 2020, Premier John Horgan committed to a review of the B.C.
Police Act with a focus on increasing funding for health services, including mental
health and addictions, and funding for housing to address the issue of
homelessness;
12. First responders, non-profits, outreach workers, as well as shelter and housing
providers are all variously trained in some form of de-escalation techniques
through non-violent crisis intervention instruction and trauma-informed
workshops;
13. The City of Vancouver’s Arts, Culture and Community Services department,
currently support peer workers including service as community first responders,
in programs led by people with lived experience (mental health, substance use,
poverty); and in partnership with service and housing providers, provincial
partners and Vancouver Police Department;

Council Meeting
Minutes, January 25, 2022 7
14. Many cities are beginning to prioritize community-based crisis worker teams to
work with and independently of police in response to mental health crisis,
addictions and homelessness on the street;
15. In Eugene, Oregon, the Crisis Assistance Helping Out on the Streets
(CAHOOTS) program handled 18% of the 133,000 calls to 911 in 2019,
requesting police backup only 150 times. The program also offers
de-escalation training that provides an overview of assessment and intervention
skills so that a lay-person can maintain personal safety and recognize when
someone might need help; 9
16. Increasingly the private sector, including BIAs and security providers 10, 11 are
learning de-escalation techniques through non-violent crisis intervention
instruction and trauma-informed workshops, and offering instruction to their
members. For example: Toronto’s Downtown Yonge BIA 12 holds information
sessions (facilitated by the Canadian Mental Health Association) for business
owners and managers who want to learn more about techniques for
de-escalation when individuals enter their establishments in distress; and
17. Many businesses and residents of Downtown Vancouver find themselves
ill-equipped for any sort of community-based crisis management or de-
escalation, and amidst increasing reports of conflict surrounding chronic street
nuisance and disorder, many Vancouverites don’t know who to call, how to help
or how to get help.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Vancouver City Council commit to supporting a community-based crisis
management strategy informed by understanding and de-escalation, that
promotes public safety and prioritizes non-policing interventions where applicable
and appropriate as a first response.
B. THAT Council direct staff to develop within the strategy a pilot community-based
crisis management program of public information, education, and engagement
that:
a. Is inclusive and accessible to residents and businesses in Vancouver;
b. Is informed by destigmatized, decolonial and anti-racist practice;
c. Is rooted in non-violent crisis intervention and de-escalation;
d. Is rooted in compassion and mutual understanding;
e. Is informed by best practices and lived experience;
f. Provides participants a better understanding of issues around mental
health, addictions and trauma;
g. Provides participants tools to help someone experiencing a mental health
of substance use emergency;
h. Considers place-making opportunities to counter impressions and
incidence of street disorder and chronic street nuisance; and
i. Reduces call volumes for police response, while redirecting more
appropriate resources as applicable;

Council Meeting
Minutes, January 25, 2022 8
FURTHER THAT this pilot program include input from Vancouver Coastal Health,
Vancouver Police Department, Canadian Mental Health Association, Ministry of
Mental Health and Addictions, and others (including but not limited to community
groups, peer supporters and BIAs) as applicable;
AND FURTHER THAT a preliminary work plan for the strategy and pilot program
inform 2021 Budget considerations.
C. THAT the Mayor on behalf of Council write to the Premier, Minister of Public
Safety, Minister of Mental Health and Addictions, Minister of Municipal Affairs
and Housing, and Minister of Poverty Reduction requesting increased investment
in social services directed to poverty, public safety, unstable housing, mental
health and addictions in Vancouver, as well as support for a community-based
crisis management strategy.

Prior to the vote on the amendment, Councillor Kirby-Yung rose on a point of order to inquire if
the amendment was in order as per section 8.7(d) of the Procedure By-law as the amendment
was redundant due to the letters previously written on the subject matter.

Council Meeting
Minutes, January 25, 2022 9
Following a brief recess, the Mayor ruled the amendment in order, noting that section 8.7(d)
concerns passing direction to staff that conflicts with a resolution previously passed and still in
force.

2. Supporting Additional Transportation Options to Reduce Reliance on Vehicle
Ownership
MOVED by Councillor Dominato
SECONDED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
WHEREAS
1. Whether it be land use, urban design, housing, or transportation, Vancouver City
Council strives at all times to respond to the needs of the city’s residents and
foster positive change and innovation. Our primary mission is to create a great
city that cares about its people, the environment, and opportunities to live, work,
and prosper;
2. On November 14, 2018, Vancouver City Council initiated a City-Wide Plan
process that will guide the city to 2050 and beyond. Core considerations
propelling the plan include the city’s housing affordability challenges and an
accelerating global climate change crisis;

Council Meeting
Minutes, January 25, 2022 23
3. On November 17, 2020, Council approved a Climate Emergency Action Plan that
builds upon previous climate plans. The focus of the plan is to cut carbon
pollution from the city’s biggest local sources (i.e., vehicles at 39% and buildings
at 54%);
4. The Vancouver Plan process, Planning Vancouver Together, has developed 10
Provisional Goals for the city based upon “a year of listening to Vancouver’s
hopes, fears, joys and struggles”, including a goal to create complete, connected,
walkable, accessible, culturally vibrant neighbourhoods where every resident can
meet their daily needs without relying on private transportation;
5. Notwithstanding the goal to meet the daily needs of residents without relying on
private transportation, in practical terms, not every transportation need of
residents can be met by walking, cycling, or making use of transit;
6. Car-sharing networks provide a cost-effective, transportation option for residents
which spreads the use of a small number of vehicles between many drivers,
thereby saving on the expense of maintaining a private vehicle, as well as
contributing to a more sustainable and livable city by eliminating the need to own
a private vehicle. The car-sharing model offers residents access to a wide array
of vehicles they can rent including electric vehicles;
7. A number of car-sharing organizations operate in Vancouver. These
organizations are encouraged and supported by the City of Vancouver.
Examples include Evo and Modo;1
8. In addition to car-sharing companies and organizations such as Evo and Modo,
peer-to-peer car-sharing has emerged as an option for residents to consider
when the need to access a vehicle arises. Unlike traditional car-sharing,
peer-to-peer car-sharing – for example Turo which launched in Vancouver in
June 2020 – connects private vehicle owners with those seeking to rent a
specific vehicle via an online platform;
9. ICBC has embraced peer-to-peer car-sharing and offers basic blanket insurance
products to companies such as Turo to cover drivers while a vehicle is being
rented. The basic blanket insurance offered by ICBC provides coverage for
accident benefits and $200,000 third party liability;
10. The City’s existing policy and regulatory frameworks may not fully account for
rapidly emerging car-sharing innovations and trends such as peer-to-peer
car-sharing. Policy and regulatory opportunities might include:
• Listing city owned vehicles on peer-to-peer car sharing platforms and
allowing City employees to use peer-to-peer cars for business related travel;
• Updating the Street and Traffic By-law No. 2849 to enable peer-to-peer
car-share parking in “resident only” and “no parking except with permit” areas
(currently applies to car-share);
• Creating opportunities for low-carbon vehicles to park in the city (T2040 M
5.2.3) – enable parking for peer-to-peer car-sharing EVs;

Council Meeting
Minutes, January 25, 2022 24
• Supporting access for peer-to-peer car-sharing at VYR, Pacific Central, and
at mobility and transit centers;
• Adding Turo and other peer-to-peer car-sharing platforms to the City’s
website; and
• Partnering on charging stations throughout the city for EVs (T2040M 5.1.3.) –
affordable access to charging for peer-to-peer car-sharing EVs.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to engage with peer-to-peer
car-sharing companies and organizations, such as but not limited to Turo, and explore
opportunities for encouraging peer-to-peer car-sharing through adaptation of the City’s
regulatory framework;
FURTHER THAT staff report back with their findings and recommendations in Q2 2022.
* * * * *
Reference:
1 As of September 12, 2019, Evo Car Share has an agreement in place with the City to allow its members to end their
one-way car-sharing trips in metered parking spaces. As part of this agreement, Evo is covering the full cost of using
the metered parking. https://vancouver.ca/streets-transportation/car-sharing-carpooling-and-ride-sharing.aspx

3. Making Home: Housing For All Of Us
MOVED by Mayor Stewart
SECONDED by Councillor Wiebe
WHEREAS
1. Vancouver is one of the greatest cities in the world in which to live;
2. Vancouver is also one of the most unaffordable cities in the world in which to live
with many residents struggling to rent or purchase homes and adequate
accommodation being especially difficult for households with an annual income
under $80,000;
3. Vancouver suffers from a “missing middle” of housing choices with the Downtown
core featuring a highly densified urban landscape but the vast majority of the
remaining residential land reserved for legacy housing forms such as single
detached homes or duplexes usually too expensive for all but the wealthiest to
rent or buy;
4. Vancouver has declared a climate emergency, which requires constructing
critical infrastructure and more walkable neighbourhoods to reduce greenhouse
gas emissions.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to develop appropriate
policies and/or guidelines for Council’s consideration in 2022, targeting up to 2000 lots
currently zoned for single-detached home or duplexes to be developed for up to six
units, subject to appropriate rezonings, and that the new policy:
i. Consider modest height increases to ensure compatibility with neighbouring
buildings;
ii. Consider lower floor units to be located appropriately below grade;
iii. Consider development cost expectations where appropriate to limit potential
speculative land purchases;
iv. Consider development cost levies where appropriate to contribute to
neighbourhood infrastructure such as water, sewers, active transportation, roads,
sidewalks, parks, child care, and housing affordable for households with annual
incomes less than $80,000 either on location or elsewhere in the city;
v. Consider development contributions where appropriate, including community
amenity contributions, that can help advance the Climate Emergency Action
Plan, community facilities, or other public benefits, payable as determined by
Council in its unfettered discretion when considering any rezoning; and
vi. Consider how the Tenant Relocation and Protection Policy can be applied to
tenancies in properties considered for redevelopment under this policy;
FURTHER THAT Council also direct staff to develop appropriate policies and/or
guidelines for Council’s later consideration to reduce floor space ratio for
single-detached homes as a densification incentive;

4. Towards a Quieter and Emission-Free Landscape Maintenance Equipment Future
in Vancouver
MOVED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
SECONDED by Councillor Boyle
WHEREAS
1. The City of Vancouver is committed to helping citizens enjoy a good quality of life
by regulating and enforcing property use, noise, and graffiti issues. The City
works to manage noise through land-use planning, by-laws and traffic
management;
2. Noise is part of urban life, but too much noise is disruptive and harmful to
well-being. The City’s Noise Control By-law defines how much noise is
acceptable, based on:
• Where you are
• Where the noise is coming from
• What is making the noise
• What time and day the noise is occurring
3. The City’s Noise Control By-law aims to balance noise from most activities in a
way that respects everyone's right to relative comfort, within reason. The by-law
specifically regulates noise from:

Council Meeting
Minutes, January 25, 2022 27
• Carpet-cleaning equipment within vehicles
• Lawn mowers and weed eaters
• TVs, radios, stereos, amplifiers, and musical instruments
• Parties and gatherings
• People shouting
• Pressure washers
4. Historically, in 1997, growing concerns about noise and its effects on everyday
life in Vancouver led to the creation of the Urban Noise Task Force. This citizens
group, with the assistance of City staff and Councillors, made a series of
recommendations for improving Vancouver’s “soundscape” many of which have
been, or are being implemented;
5. The Report of the Urban Noise Task Force from April 1997 noted that “Lawn
mowers, leaf blowers, trimmers, edgers, mulchers, and other lawn and garden
equipment are a significant source of noise for many people” and that “Twenty-
five percent of the letters received by the Task Force commented about the noise
produced by these machines.” The report also noted that “Noise from motorized
lawn/garden equipment was the most frequently mentioned noise problem” and
thus the Task Force strongly suggested that the City move toward the use of
non-motorized gardening services and methods in its own operations;
6. Recommendation 40.1 from the 1997 Urban Noise Task Force report states that
“The City should, based on technological advances within the industry, require
that all leaf blowers maintain a maximum decibel level of 70 at 50 feet until
January 1998, when 65 decibels will be the maximum allowable; that they be run
at the lowest effective throttle setting and that between October 1 and April 30 of
each year the City establish hours of use….”;
7. The City’s website currently states that “Leaf blowers can be operated in
Vancouver, but not in the West End” (i.e., an area bounded by Stanley Park,
Burrard Street, West Georgia Street, and Beach Avenue. The City of Vancouver
defines a leaf blower as a “backpack-mounted or handheld machine used for
blowing or sucking up leaves, grass, or debris.” Leaf blowers may have vacuum
attachments. Vehicle-mounted leaf blowers are not included in the City’s
definition;
8. The City’s website states that “A manufacturer’s decal must be attached to the
leaf blower” to certify that it meets the "Category 1 – dB (A) ≤ 65" equipment
standard set out in ANSI B175.2 – 200, published by the Portable Power
Equipment Manufacturer’s Association. The decal includes the following text:
[The manufacturer's model number] and Maximum sound level 65 dB(A) and
Measured at 50 ft (15 m) Per ANSI B175.2 – 200;
9. Vancouver has declared a Climate Emergency and developed a plan that aims to
reduce carbon pollution by 50% by 2030;

Council Meeting
Minutes, January 25, 2022 28
10. In January 2019, the Vancouver Park Board unanimously carried a motion
(“Renewal Strategy for Landscape Equipment – Towards an Emission-Free
Reality”) which directed Park Board staff to work with unions and WorkSafeBC
“to develop a transition plan to replace and retrofit gas-powered landscape
maintenance equipment used for park maintenance with emission-free
equivalents or quasi-equivalents where possible.” The motion also directed that
“the transition plan include financial considerations, including purchase, usage,
maintenance and end-of-life replacement costs, as well as ways to
quantify/qualify non-financial benefits such as: carbon emission reduction;
disposal of refuse oil and other parts;
11. A recent December 7, 2020, Memo from the Park Board General Manager
served to report back on the work being undertaken by Park Board staff in
response to motion approved by the Board in January 2019. It states that staff
anticipate transitioning all small landscaping equipment to zero emission
alternatives over the next four years. The Memo also notes several key findings
from the 2019 pilot, as well as the fact the Park Board has been transitioning its
gas-powered equipment to low or no-emission equipment for many years as
equipment reaches end of life, and that electric options meeting performance and
function specifications are preferred for all equipment procurement in accordance
with Vancouver’s commitment to reducing its environmental emissions and fossil
fuel consumption;
12. Feedback received from the public by members of Council frequently cites the
issue of noise and emissions from gasoline-powered landscape maintenance
equipment, such as lawn mowers, trimmers, chain saws, and especially leaf
blowers. Members of the public often suggest that the use of gasoline-powered
equipment be prohibited in favour of non-emitting electric alternatives which are
also considered to be far quieter;
13. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the negative noise impacts from
gasoline-powered landscape maintenance equipment have been significantly
heightened for residents with so many people working from home and spending
considerably more time at home. Increasingly, Council and the City are receiving
noise complaints that point to the need to revisit noise reduction strategies with
respect to gas-powered landscape maintenance equipment and transition
towards replacement and/or retrofitting gas-powered landscape maintenance
equipment with quieter, emission-free equivalents or quasi-equivalents.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Vancouver City Council direct staff to report back with recommendations to
meet the goal to phase out and transition personal and commercial use of
gasoline-powered landscape maintenance equipment in the City of Vancouver by
2024, giving consideration to a timeframe that is workable for residents and
landscape maintenance service providers alike.

Council Meeting
Minutes, January 25, 2022 29
B. THAT recommendations are informed by consultation with relevant stakeholders
such as but not limited to representative strata councils and the BC Landscape
and Nursery Association.
C. THAT phase out recommendations be sensitive to any increased costs that
transitioning would create for residents and the landscape maintenance industry,
and that a reasonable transition timeframe be considered before any potential
by-law changes would be implemented.
D. THAT the report back identify (but not be limited to):
• any issues with respect to implementing a ban on gasoline-powered
landscape maintenance equipment;
• all relevant City by-laws and policies that currently impact upon noise and
emissions from gasoline-powered landscape maintenance equipment that
would require amendment;
• information related to the impact that gasoline-powered landscape
maintenance equipment can have on noise and local/regional air pollution
as well as implications for mental well-being, quality of life and human
health;
• information regarding harmful environmental effects of gasoline-powered
landscape maintenance equipment;
• information on availability and trends that would allow non-emitting
electric landscaping equipment to equal and/or exceed the performance
of gasoline-powered equipment.

5. Supporting Local Journalism and Its Impact on Civic Democracy
MOVED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
SECONDED by Councillor Hardwick
WHEREAS
1. A healthy, professional news media is essential for the proper functioning of civil
society and democracy at the local, regional, federal and international levels;
2. The Public Policy Forum declares — on its website for the 2017 report The
Shattered Mirror: News, Democracy and Trust in the Digital Age (commissioned
by the federal government) — that “real news is in crisis” in this country;
3. The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) cited eight “critical
information needs” the media help to provide including emergencies; other public
risks to health; education; the environment; economic opportunities; civic and
political knowledge of policy initiatives; and the conduct of public officials, and
candidates for office (The Shattered Mirror p.4);
4. Canadians have lost the essential services provided by roughly 3,000 media
workers across Canada due to temporary and permanent layoffs from the time
the COVID-19 pandemic began — a time it became clearer to the public how
important it is for Canadians to receive accurate information — and advertising
revenues have plunged;
5. Residents of 190 Canadian communities lost 250 established news outlets due to
closings or mergers between 2008 and 2018;
6. Two thirds of Canadians agree or somewhat agree that because of the
Coronavirus/COVID-19 outbreak the federal government should treat widespread
media bankruptcies and layoffs as an emergency, according to a Nanos

6. Ensuring the Health of E-Comm and the Stable Delivery of Emergency Services for
the Public and Residents
MOVED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
SECONDED by Councillor Dominato
WHEREAS
1. E-Comm (Emergency Communications for British Columbia Incorporated) is a
non-profit corporation governed under the Emergency Communications
Corporations Act. It was established in 1999 and is owned and governed by
various municipal, regional, and provincial emergency services including the City
of Vancouver;

Council Meeting
Minutes, January 25, 2022 32
2. The City of Vancouver is currently represented on the E-Comm Board of
Directors by City Manager Paul Mochrie. The Vancouver Police Board is
represented on the E-Comm Board of Directors by former Vancouver Police
Department Deputy Chief Warren Lemcke;
3. E-Comm owns and maintains the emergency radio system used by police, fire,
and ambulance services within Metro Vancouver and parts of the Fraser Valley;
4. E-Comm is the first point of contact for 99 percent of callers who dial 9-1-1 in
B.C. and it provides call-taking and dispatch services for 33 police agencies and
40 fire departments across the province. E-Comm has approximately 422
full-time and 94 part-time employees (based on a 12-month average), many of
whom are represented by CUPE Local 8911;
5. E-Comm provides an essential public service to millions of British Columbians,
but ongoing challenges have reportedly put this vital service at risk of
catastrophic failure for the public who rely upon it. CUPE 8911 cites various
challenges to the system, including understaffing in a high-stress environment
that has led to severe burnout, poor working conditions, high staff turnover, and
ongoing challenges with recruitment and the training of new staff;
6. CUPE 8911 points to “a reactive funding formula, based on cost recovery” in an
issue backgrounder as the main impediment to meaningfully improving the
services it provides and “getting ahead of existing problems” (see: E-COMM
9-1-1: Fixing A Broken Service – A Guide For B.C. Municipalities – by The
Emergency Communications Professionals of BC (CUPE LOCAL 8911)
https://www.ecpbc.ca/wp-
content/uploads/2021/10/CUPE8911_Backgrounder_FNL.pdf);
7. The CRTC has mandated modernization to move from 9-1-1 voice calls to digital
or IP-based infrastructure, which is to be completed by March 1, 2022;
8. E-Comm is preparing for the transition from 9-1-1 voice calls to digital or
IP-based infrastructure in accordance with direction from the CRTC and has
communicated the need for a significant additional funding commitment from
each 9-1-1 service partner in 2022 and beyond. Digital or IP-based 9-1-1
services will reportedly revolutionize the 9-1-1 service and will ultimately enable
9-1-1 operators to respond to video, photo, and text calls for service through
9-1-1;
9. As the media have widely reported, during a crisis such as extreme weather
events seen during this past summer’s heatwave, E-Comm is simply unable to
handle call volumes. A recent report from Price Waterhouse Cooper –
commissioned by E-Comm – concluded that the company cannot be successful
with an understaffed system that relies so heavily “on overtime and staff missing
breaks” or that simply abandons efforts to meet its service levels; i
10. Reports of inadequate staffing levels amid the high-stress working environment
at E-Comm which have reportedly led to severe burnout, poor working

Council Meeting
Minutes, January 25, 2022 33
conditions, high staff turnover, and ongoing challenges with recruitment and
training of new staff, point to the need for better health and mental health
supports for E-Comm staff and a commensurate level of funding, to ensure the
stability and effectiveness of our emergency response systems and the vitally
important role of E-Comm staff in our emergency response system;
11. In 2021, the President and CEO of E-Comm, Oliver Grüter-Andrew, made two
presentations to the provincial legislature’s Special Committee on Reforming the
Police Act (October 15, 2021 and February 26, 2021) in which the CEHO
elaborated on many of the challenges faced by E-Comm and its staff – these
were generally consistent with the challenges cited by CUPE 8911;
13. The need for operational change and infrastructure investment in E-Comm to
ensure the stable delivery of appropriate levels of day-to-day and emergency
level services expected by the public and Vancouver residents, is readily
apparent and inherently in the public interest and the interest of public safety.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to report back with an assessment and report by the
end of April, 2022 on the E-Comm situation (as outlined and identified by CUPE
Local 8911 and other stakeholders), with information and options the City of
Vancouver could support, advocate for and/or endorse, in order to enable the
stable delivery of Emergency Services for the public and to address the range of
identified issues faced by E-Comm such as but not limited to an equitable and
evolved E-Comm funding model, the mandated CRTC modernization
requirements, E-Comm governance and operational models, and various
E-Comm capital investment needs.
B. FURTHER THAT Council request the Mayor on behalf of Council to write to the
relevant Federal and Provincial Ministers (such as BC’s Ministers of Health and
Public Safety and the Federal Ministers responsible for the CRTC and Public
Safety) to advocate for capital funding to support and assist with the technology
modernization and transformation mandated by the CRTC, to move away from
9-1-1 voice calls in favour of digital or IP-based infrastructure, in order to help
close an identified E-Comm capital funding gap and to ensure the improvement
of crucial emergency services for the public.
C. THAT copies of this motion, together with the letters requested in B above, be
sent to the Union of BC Municipalities and the Lower Mainland Local
Government Association for their information and consideration.

7. Advancing Efforts for an Age-Friendly City of Vancouver
MOVED by Councillor Swanson
SECONDED by Councillor Boyle
WHEREAS
1. According to the 2016 Canadian census, there are more than 95,570 persons
aged 65 and older living in Vancouver, accounting for approximately 15.1% of the
city’s total population. Moreover, the population of adults over the age of 65 in the
province of British Columbia is expected to rise approximately 63% by the year
2041;
2. Older persons living on their own are at increased risk of experiencing
homelessness. A large proportion of older persons in Vancouver are living on
their own. Currently, 21% of all households in Vancouver are senior-led and it is
estimated that over the course of the next decade, 23-25% of households in the
city will be led by persons over the age of 65. According to data from the 2016
census, approximately 16.6% of all senior-led renter households were spending
50% or more of their income on their housing costs, making them housing
insecure and placing them at increased risk of eviction. The majority of these
individuals are single women. Moreover, the social housing waitlist for older
adults has increased by 54% between 2014 to 2019 and individuals over the age
of 65 represent 37% of the region’s waitlist;
3. Older persons can face unique barriers to civic participation such as health
limitations, mobility challenges, and cognitive decline. In fact, 52,700 individuals
65 and older (55%) in Vancouver reported that they have specific health and
activity limitations, including 20,660 older persons who reported permanent
challenges and 24,045 older adults who sometimes experience challenges.
These barriers put older persons at increased risk of experiencing social
isolation, loneliness, and economic vulnerability;
4. Recent health and climate emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and
the heat dome, have disproportionately impacted older persons. The BC Seniors

Council Meeting
Minutes, January 25, 2022 35
Advocate indicated that residents of long-term care and assisted living homes
were 33 times more likely to die from COVID. 99 people in Vancouver died
during the heat dome, many of then older adults. Vancouver Fire Fighters
reported waiting 11 hours for a BC Ambulance for an elderly person. These
crises have highlighted the seriousness and urgency of addressing existing gaps
in policies, systems, housing, community services and programs to prevent
further devastating impacts on many people living in the city, including on older
persons;
5. The World Health Organization has declared 2021-2030 as the Decade of
Healthy Ageing and has incorporated additional met48rics under the Healthy
Cities strategy toward improving quality of life specifically for older persons
(mitigation of poverty, food security, expand opportunities for civic engagement,
opportunities for lifelong learning, age and gender equality, job opportunities,
internet access and digital support, housing, etc.);
6. The City of Vancouver has a long history of working toward age-friendly
improvements in municipal planning. In 2013, the City of Vancouver initiated the
Age-friendly Action Plan (2013-2015) and identified a series of over 60 actions
that the City can take to help make Vancouver a more safe, inclusive, and
engaging city for seniors. In the following year, Vancouver joined the World
Health Organization (WHO) Healthy Cities initiative 2014 to 2025. Under this
initiative, the City of Vancouver completed two reports: Phase 1 A Healthy City
for All: Vancouver’s Healthy City Strategy (2014) and Phase 2 Healthy City
Strategy – Four Year Action Plan (2015-2018);
7. To extend work on the Age Friendly Action Plan, the City of Vancouver Planning
department held a workshop entitled: Age-Friendly Action Research Lab
Co-initiating Workshop at Creekside Community Centre on September 24, 2018
engaging members of the Older Persons and Elders community. This work then
led to the two additional workshops on March 8 and April 15, 2019 engaging
more members of the Seniors’ community;
8. The Older Persons and Elders community was very excited by their engagement
in 2018 and 2019 workshops which was to lead to the creation of Strategy for
Older Persons and Elders. This work was interrupted during COVID-19;
9. Municipalities such as Richmond, Surrey, Calgary, Toronto, Ottawa, and
Montreal have adopted dedicated planning capacity within municipal resources to
support the needs of older persons. Their efforts have resulted in comprehensive
planning and formal partnerships and MOUs across different levels of
government, multi-agencies, and community organizations specifically focused
on supporting Healthy Ageing;
10. Gaps and challenges remain in municipal planning for older persons and elders
in the City of Vancouver. On September 28, 2021, City Council convened 2050:
An Expert Discussion on Planning and Growth where each consultant noted that
the Vancouver Plan was devoid of any strategies to address the impacts of the
demographic shift in population. Particular emphasis was placed on the need to

Council Meeting
Minutes, January 25, 2022 36
expand housing options in all neighbourhoods and community programs and
services to best meet the evolving needs of our aging population;
11. The City of Vancouver’s social policy team is working hard on a number of
important Council directed initiatives, including Poverty Reduction, Access
Without Fear for residents with precarious immigration status, Sex Worker Safety
initiatives, social policy grants, and more. This team is spread thin. Without a
dedicated planner for Older Persons and Elders, the City of Vancouver’s has
struggled to keep up with best practices in social policy development to address
the needs of seniors, and to ensure that our growing population of older persons
and Elders can engage and participate fully in civic and community life; and
12. The Seniors Advisory Committee has asked its two Councillor Liaisons to put
forward this motion to City Council.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to explore and report back as soon as possible, without
detracting from work on other equity items currently being undertaken (some of
which may also benefit older persons and elders), on a plan to advance efforts to
make Vancouver an age-friendly city, with an ongoing intersectional approach,
including consideration of:
i. Redirecting selected staff to complete the creation of Phase 3 –
Age-Friendly City in consultation with the Seniors’ Advisory Committee
and community partners as the next step toward the development of a
Strategy for Older Persons and Elders.
ii. Reviewing the recent Reports by the World Health Organization and the
United Nations to embrace the UN Decade of Healthy Ageing (2021-
2030) inform and refresh the City of Vancouver’s Healthy Cities strategy.
iii. Updating the Equity Framework and the Vancouver Plan to better
address the lack of adequate planning for Older Persons and Elders.
iv. Working to develop a Memorandum of Understanding and Planning
Committee with the Provincial Health Services Authority, Vancouver
Coastal Health Authority, BC Ministry of Housing and Canada Mortgage
Housing Corporation to participate in a planning process with community
partners to better address the needs and interests of older persons and
elders.
v. Ensuring that the needs of racialized, gender diverse, and low income
Older Persons, and older people with disabilities, are prioritized.
B. THAT this report back include consideration of the Seniors Advisory Committee’s
request that the City of Vancouver reassign resources, without detracting from
work on other equity items currently being undertaken, to provide a dedicated
full-time planning position to focus on older persons and elders with an
intersectional lens across city departments and liaise with external agencies, a
position which could include the following:

Council Meeting
Minutes, January 25, 2022 37
i. Provide expertise to City Council on issues related to population
aging.
ii. Complete the co-development and implementation of the City of
Vancouver’s strategic plans, policies, and protocols to better
reflect the needs and interests of older persons and elders in
collaboration and coordination of partners.
iii. Identify, collect data, and analyze challenges experienced by the
City of Vancouver’s aging population to provide evidence-informed
recommendations for improvements to City Council.
iv. Develop reports and deliver presentations on aging issues for
older persons in Vancouver.
v. Represent the City of Vancouver at community tables, partner
meetings, and stakeholder events related to healthy aging, equity,
emergency preparedness, climate change, transportation, food
security, housing, homelessness and other city-related programs
and services that impact older persons and elders.
vi. Act as a resource and staff liaison to guide the work of the City of
Vancouver’s Seniors’ Advisory Committee.
vii. Provide training and education on issues related to aging to all
municipal employees and elected representatives.
viii. Consult and work with community partners in the design and
delivery of senior services to benefit from the experience, skills,
knowledge, and resources our growing community of older
persons and elders have to offer and would be delighted to
contribute.
ix. Strengthen relationships with provincial governments and
agencies, federal government (CMHC, New Horizons,
Employment and Social Development Canada) and other Seniors’
Planners in Metro Vancouver (currently Richmond and Surrey) in
collaboration with the non-profit sector to secure municipal
investment in housing for older persons and elders, infrastructure,
programs and services.
x. Collaborate with community partners to keep abreast of national
and international initiatives that have expanded housing options
for seniors (e.g. Co-housing, Lifetime Neighbourhoods,
Resident-driven senior homes, Apartments for Life, Homeshare,
Dementia Villages, Compassionate Communities, Home
Modification) including housing for older persons who are
homeless and low income renters.

WHEREAS
1. “Vancouver” exists on the unceded homelands and waters of the xʷməθkʷəy̓ əm,
Sḵwx̱wú7mesh, and səlilwətaɬ Peoples;
2. The Strait of Georgia, Strait of Juan de Fuca, and Puget Sound are collectively
known as the Salish Sea; however, as of 2019, only 15% 1 of British Columbians
could identify the waters of the Salish Sea;
3. The Salish Sea is witnessing devastating biodiversity loss 2, namely the risk of
extinction of over 100 species of birds, fish, invertebrates, mammals, and key
species including Salmon and the Southern Resident Killer Whales;

Council Meeting
Minutes, January 25, 2022 39
4. The Salish Sea and its human and nonhuman inhabitants are experiencing
unprecedented effects of climate change, felt during the 2021 heat dome,
flooding from atmospheric rivers, intensified king tides, prolonged forest fires,
ocean acidification, and sea-level rise;
5. In Canada, the Salish Sea and its watersheds are managed under multiple
jurisdictions of government, including the Indigenous, federal, provincial,
regional, and municipal with limited coordination;
6. There is incredible work currently underway to support ocean conservation and
ocean-related climate adaptation in the region, including Tsleil-Waututh Nation’s
Burrard Inlet Action Plan, the 5th International Marine Protected Areas Congress,
the Sea2City Design Challenge, and the Salish Sea Ecosystem Conference,
among other initiatives;
7. On November 27, 2020, Metro Vancouver approved the establishment of a task
force to consider the feasibility of reinstating the Burrard Inlet Environmental
Action Program – Fraser River Estuary Management Program Partnership, or
establishment of an equivalent multi-stakeholder partnership for coordinated
environmental management in the region; and
8. The Year of the Salish Sea would support collaborative local action between
Salish Sea stakeholders, strengthen organizational programming for impact and
awareness, educate the public, amplify existing work, and inspire action from
individuals, organizations, and governments on the Salish Sea.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Vancouver City Council support the SFU Fall 2021 Semester in Dialogue
cohort recommendation to proclaim June 8, 2022 to June 7, 2023 as the “Year of
the Salish Sea” in Vancouver, thereby acting as a catalyst for other governing
bodies, organizations, and community groups to join a collective effort to improve
the health and management of the Salish Sea.
B. THAT Vancouver City Council direct staff to educate the public on how ongoing
City of Vancouver projects (such as sewer separation, climate adaptation, and
other Green Rainwater Infrastructure projects) benefit the Salish Sea and its
surrounding ecosystems.
C. THAT Vancouver City Council direct staff to explore opportunities to collaborate
with local organizations, networks, and individuals taking part in the Year of the
Salish Sea to raise public awareness about the importance of a revitalized and
healthy Salish Sea.

9. Cutting Red Tape: Making Homes Accessible
MOVED by Councillor Dominato
SECONDED by Councillor Wiebe
WHEREAS
1. The Preamble to the Accessible Canada Act (S.C. 2019, c. 10) makes note of
the Canadian Human Rights Act and states that “all individuals should have an
opportunity equal with other individuals to make for themselves the lives that they
are able and wish to have and to have their needs accommodated without
discrimination and, in particular, discrimination on the basis of disability.”;
2. The Preamble of the Accessible Canada Act (S.C. 2019, c. 10) also states that “a
proactive and systemic approach for identifying, removing and preventing
barriers to accessibility without delay complements the rights of persons with
disabilities under the Canadian Human Rights Act.”;

Council Meeting
Minutes, January 25, 2022 41
3. The Provincial Government has a vision to make B.C. a truly inclusive province
for all persons with disabilities by removing the barriers that prevent equal and
meaningful participation in society. British Columbia also supports the principles
outlined in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with
Disabilities (UNCRPD) and is strongly committed to advancing and safeguarding
those principles within the province;
4. On June 17, 2021, the B.C. Legislature passed the Accessible British Columbia
Act into law. The Act allows the provincial government to establish “accessibility
standards” aimed at identifying, removing, and preventing barriers to accessibility
and inclusion, including the establishment of accessibility standards in a range of
sectors, including delivery of services and the built environment;
5. The City of Vancouver has taken steps over the course of many years toward the
goal of becoming a fully accessible city, one that values all members of its
diverse communities and strives to meet the needs of everyone, regardless of
ability;
6. The City of Vancouver is developing an Accessibility Strategy with the intent to
reflect and reinforce the City’s commitment to accessibility. For example by:
a. Respecting the rights, dignity, and independence of persons with
disabilities over the life course;
b. Fostering a safe environment where all people feel valued, included, and
a sense of belonging;
c. Creating opportunities for persons with disabilities to be involved in
decision-making and to participate fully in all aspects of city life;
d. Demonstrating how the knowledge and perspectives of persons with
disabilities are integrated across all City processes, policies, and
decision-making;
e. Listening to and addressing the needs of persons with disabilities in City
programs, services, and physical infrastructure;
7. Over 5% of Vancouver residents have some form of physical disability or mobility
restriction. This includes people using wheelchairs, walkers, and canes. When
you add their accompanying family and friends, approximately 50% of Vancouver
residents are affected by poor access to buildings; i
8. Building for accessibility is an important element of an inclusive city. The City of
Vancouver has therefore established accessibility standards for new
construction, including the importance of ramps and door handles;
9. Although accessibility is a foremost consideration in new construction, the city
also has a substantial stock of older buildings, including older housing stock,
many of which require significant and costly retrofits in order to be fully and
appropriately accessible. For example, retrofitting bathrooms that can
accommodate specific disabilities;

Council Meeting
Minutes, January 25, 2022 42
10. Retrofitting older housing stock to make it accessible typically requires a permit
or permits from the City, which – given the City’s ongoing permit backlog
situation – often means lengthy wait-times, delays, and frustration for those
seeking permits to retrofit housing for accessibility needs;
11. In order to clear the City’s permit and license backlog, the City is taking action to
speed up its response and processing times. These actions include speeding up
response and processing times by temporarily relaxing the City’s permit
application regulations and review process and cutting steps from the City’s
processes. The intended goal is to process permits faster, significantly reduce
staff review times, and provide more predictable results for applicants. The work
of the City Manager's task force is currently underway to identify the steps
involved in this initiative and the phased, multi-month process that has been
implemented; ii
12. Lengthy permit delays and backlogs are not the only policy and process problem
faced by persons with disabilities and their families and caregivers.
Accommodating and giving appropriate consideration to renovations and
alterations that require a deviation from current zoning by-laws is also needed in
order to satisfactorily achieve the City’s stated policy goals and objectives with
respect to accessibility; and
13. The City does not currently have specific policies, procedures, or protocols to
prioritize, and/or significantly accommodate, permit applications for those seeking
to retrofit and/or modify older housing stock to accommodate a range of
accessibility needs and ensure a dignified and equal quality of life for persons
with disabilities. This includes accessibility policies and procedures for
renovations that may require a deviation from current zoning by-laws.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to develop policy and
procedures to appropriately prioritize permit applications for accessibility retrofits, in
consultation with the City’s Persons with Disabilities Advisory Committee and other
relevant stakeholders and partners, such that a dignified and equal quality of life can be
ensured for persons with disabilities in our community;
FURTHER THAT Council direct staff to report back in Q4 2022 with draft policy and
procedures to achieve the accessibility objectives noted above, including (but not
restricted to) investigating options for:
i. Assigning staff who are familiar with accessible design matters in relevant
City departments who are able to address the specific daily needs and
experiences of persons with disabilities (including the related accessibility
needs of their friends, families, caregivers, etc.);
ii. Establishing a clear and publicly posted path for persons with disabilities
to follow in order to facilitate communication with the City’s planning and
building department staff;

Council Meeting
Minutes, January 25, 2022 43
iii. Establishing clear criteria for the City staff responsible for processing and
issuing permits to follow that is fair and transparent in terms of how permit
applications related to accessibility needs are to be prioritized, including
publicly posted information that specifically measures and reports on the
average permit processing times for permits specific to accessibility
needs;
iv. Accommodating and giving appropriate consideration to proposed
renovations and alterations that require deviation from the City’s existing
zoning by-laws in order to achieve accessibility;
v. Identifying and addressing any inconsistencies between the City’s stated
commitment to accessibility, and the rights of persons with disabilities to
equitable treatment, and how this commitment manifests in daily practice
and practical experience.

MOVED by Councillor Bligh
SECONDED by Councillor De Genova
WHEREAS
1. On November 27, 2019, Council resolved to amend the License By-law No. 4450
regarding single-use beverage cups, effective January 1, 2021;
2. At the January 21, 2020, Council meeting, two By-law amendments related to
single-use beverage cups were unanimously approved by Council, notably
By-law No. 4450;
3. The amendment to By-law No. 4450 reads as follows: “15.8 (1) Every food
vendor must charge at least 25 cents for every single-use beverage cup
distributed to a customer.”;
4. On December 9, 2020, the City announced that it was postponing the new
By-law fee on single-use cups (as well as an associated ban on plastic shopping
bags) to 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic;
5. On January 1, 2022, the minimum fee of $0.25 for each single-use beverage cup
distributed under the City’s By-law became effective;
6. In the days immediately following the January 1, 2022, implementation of the
$0.25 fee on single-use beverage cups, several unintended consequences and
public concerns became apparent. Not the least of these were the unintended
equity impacts on the most vulnerable persons in our community;
7. The experience and public feedback from the implementation of the City’s
single-use beverage cup fee on January 1, 2022, point to a need for City Council
and the City to revisit the cup fee question on an urgent basis.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to report back on an urgent
basis by or before March 15, 2022, to provide Council with a better understanding of the
facts and experience to date from the January 1, 2022, implementation of the $0.25
single-use beverage cup fee, including staff recommendations for any adjustments to the
policy and related By-laws related to (but not limited to) issues of equity, food delivery
apps, and any maladaptive strategies that may serve to circumvent the fee, among other
identified issues and unintended consequences that have been observed.

ENQUIRIES AND OTHER MATTERS
1. Facilitating Outreach and Support Services
Councillor Swanson inquired if staff were working on a plan to meet the needs of people who
are homeless at CRAB Park and other places, and also whether the City was meeting its
obligations regarding facilitating outreach and support services to individuals living in
encampments, specifically noting the recent Court decision. She noted this work was agreed to
in a previously signed memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the Province and the Park
Board that formalized commitment to work together to help prevent encampments. The City
Manager advised that staff are preparing an In Camera briefing to Council on the matter, and
noted that the City is supporting people in the encampment at CRAB Park.
2. Previous Motion - Public Safety: Evaluating and Addressing Any Impacts of City
of Vancouver Actions on Neighbourhood Safety

Any Impacts of City Of Vancouver Actions on Neighbourhood Safety”, and whether the request
to the Vancouver Police Department to share updates with Council on serious crimes had been
made. The City Manager agreed to follow-up.
3. Large Cash Payments
Councillor Hardwick noted that in November 2021, there was a public report regarding large
cash payments to the City of Vancouver and in the report it stated that in 2019 City staff
accepted large cash payments without requiring identification. She inquired if staff can review,
or have already reviewed, the details that were in the report and confirm if the large cash
payments came from legitimate sources. The City Manager advised that the City is not in a
position to trace past cash payments and noted the City did work on this and now follows
guidelines regarding accepting large cash payments.
4. Housing Data
Councillor Hardwick inquired what progess is being made to get the housing data, requested by
Council, in readable form. The City Manager advised that Council has been given all the data

the City has and the City’s ability to quantify zoned capacity is constrained by the nature of
zoning in Vancouver and the information the City has.
5. Broadway Subway Work
Councillor Wiebe inquired if Council would be receiving a public report regarding the progress of
the Broadway Subway work, including current changes and timelines, and noted the

answers to all the questions they have received and noted he would follow-up with staff on
providing additional information to the public and Council to understand the status of the project.
6. Colonial Audit
Councillor Wiebe inquired if the City could do an internal Colonial audit. The City Manager
agreed to follow-up with a response.
7. Secured Rental Unit Size and Numbers of Bedrooms
Councillor Bligh inquired if Council could receive information on unit size as related to livability
as defined in the zoning and development by-law, and also requested information on the
proportion of units Council is seeing that are studios versus 1, 2 or 3 bedrooms, and how that
trend has changed over the past four years, specifically for Purpose Built Rental applications
approved by Council at Public Hearing.
8. Zero Waste Centres
Councillor Dominato requested an update on Zero Waste Centres in commercial high street
areas and also requested information on the Park Board’s implementation of Zero waste
Centres at busy parks. The City Manager agreed to provide an update.
9. Community Overdose Response Team Funding
Councillor Bligh discussed the Community Overdose Response Team partnership between
Vancouver Coastal Health (VCH) and Vancouver Fire and Rescue Services (VFRS), that was
not funded in the 2022 Capital and Operating Budget. She inquired if Council could receive
information on other creative ways to address the gap in how services are delivered in the
DTES, and how the City could help fill the gap. The City Manager noted that the VFRS Chief is
working on this matter with VCH and an update on progress would be provided to Council.
