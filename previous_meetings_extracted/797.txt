Minutes, June 23, 2020 25
3. Developing an #AllOnBoard and #RaiseARider Pilot
MOVED by Councillor Swanson
SECONDED by Councillor Boyle
WHEREAS
1. On Wednesday, January 16, 2019, Council voted to “endorse the #AllOnBoard
Campaign” and to urge TransLink to develop a plan to provide free public transit
for minors and to provide reduced-price transit based on a sliding scale using the
Market Basket Measure for all low-income people;
2. The Vancouver School Board and Vancouver Park Board have also endorsed
the #AllOnBoard campaign for “free transit access for children under 18 years of
age” and “the proposal of reduced-price transit, based on a sliding scale using
the Market Basket Measure, for all low-income people”;
3. TransLink has stated that new provincial funding “would be required to implement
expanded discounts,” and the provincial government has not yet committed to
funding TransLink or BC Transit to implement poverty reduction measures
directly;
4. Every major urban region neighbouring Vancouver (Edmonton, Calgary, Seattle
and Portland) has a discounted transit pass program based on income;
5. In 2012, United Way Calgary & Area found that youth with access to free transit
passes had higher attendance and completion rates; in 2018 in Seattle, 80% of
students who received a free transit pass said it improved their attendance at
school;
6. The City of Victoria (December 1, 2019) and the Resort Municipality of Whistler
(January 1, 2020) have introduced programs to provide free transit passes for
youth, funded through increased parking revenue;
7. The City of Vancouver owns most EasyPark lots and is expecting to collect over
$63 million in on-street parking revenue in 2020, in addition to contracts with car
share companies and fees from ride-hailing service providers;
8. Big Move #2 in the City of Vancouver’s Climate Emergency Response is “Safe
and convenient active transportation and transit,” and research shows that
making transit more accessible for youth helps raise life-long transit users;
9. The City of Vancouver has recognized and has demonstrated its commitment to
residents’ health and well-being. The lack of transportation is one of the most
common reasons for missing medical appointments and a significant barrier to
social inclusion and labour market inclusion for low-income adults and youth;
10. Transit and transportation was identified as a key theme in the March 2019 City
of Vancouver Poverty Reduction Plan What We Heard: Phase 1 report:

Council Meeting
Minutes, June 23, 2020 26
● People with various mobility issues [often must] take multiple trips in one
day;
● People [without] enough income at any one time to buy a longer-term
pass … are forced to pay more on a per-trip basis;
● People who can find steady work often do not find it near social or low-
income housing. This means they have to take bus trips often across
multiple zones to get to and from work … [which] significantly eats into
their pay;
● People with families have to pay for all the members of the family which
makes the simplest outing very expensive;
11. The City of Vancouver Poverty Reduction Plan What We Heard: Phase 1 report
also described the detrimental impacts of poverty and wealth gaps, including
social isolation and being subjected to increased policing; and the Plan will be
received in Summer 2020;
12. Rider strikes and protests in numerous cities have shown that movements for
reduced emissions, poverty, and racism are linked; Vancouver has an
opportunity to show its leadership in these areas by advocating for free and
affordable transit initiatives; and
13. COVID has reduced transit ridership and free and low cost fares would be a way
to incentivize a return to transit use and keep people out of polluting cars.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to seek an update from TransLink on its Fare Policy
Review status, including the cost estimates and implementation considerations
for free transit for youth ages 5–18 and the introduction of alternatives to fare
evasion fines for those below the poverty line.
B. THAT Council direct staff to report back to Council by Q3 with a discussion of the
feasibility of a pilot project proposal to provide free transit passes for youth and a
discounted or free pass for low-income residents, targeting Indigenous and
racialized residents living below the poverty line, and other identified equity-
seeking groups, including partnerships with TransLink, targeted schools,
community centres, academic and other partners;
FURTHER that the pilot proposal highlights opportunities and challenges of the
pilot as well as its relation to the Vancouver Plan, forthcoming poverty Reduction
Plan and the city’s equity goals.
C. THAT staff further explore sources of revenue for the pilot project that may
include existing general revenue, or transportation specific revenue sources
(parking, carshare, ride hail), potential future transportation revenue sources
(transport pricing, zero emission parking) and municipal poverty reduction grant
opportunities, and report back.

4. A Call for Race-Based and Socio-Demographic Data in B.C.
MOVED by Councillor Boyle
SECONDED by Councillor Swanson
WHEREAS
1. It is clear from other jurisdictions, including the United States, that the COVID-19
pandemic and other health concerns disproportionately impact racialized
community members and those who experience systemic, marginalizing barriers
to healthcare access and treatment as well as precarious work due to economic
exclusion and structural racism;
2. B.C. and Canada do not capture race-based data or socioeconomic data in
relation to health care access, which effectively buries the disproportionate rates
of occurrence, impact of illness and disease on certain groups within the larger
population data, resulting in missed opportunities to address long-standing health
inequities;
3. Canadian and international studies on social determinants of health (SDH) show
that social and economic factors such as race, immigration status, income level,
and housing impact people’s health outcomes. Racialized people are found to
experience systemic barriers in accessing needed health care services.
Newcomers, despite arriving in Canada in good health, experience poorer health
over time. There is also a relationship between income level and health
outcomes, for example life expectancy in the Downtown Eastside Community
Health Service Area is 22% (19 years) shorter than for the city overall. Collecting
race-based and sociodemographic data will help us better understand and
address the inequities in health care access and health outcomes in B.C. and
inform the work to save lives;

Council Meeting
Minutes, June 23, 2020 28
4. As Indigenous organizations such as the Yellowhead Institute have emphasized,
Indigenous health data may require its own strategy, led by and for Indigenous
people, due to historic and present-day practices that misuse data or focus only
on negative findings;
5. Due to ongoing anti-Black racism and a long history of structural
anti-Black racism in Canada and in B.C., scholars, policy makers, scientists, and
frontline practitioners have named the need for a research protocol focused on
the unique demands for the ethical engagement of Black communities in
research, data collection and evaluation processes. The Research, Education,
Data Ethics-Protocol for Black Populations (REDE4BlackLives.com) has been
developed for this purpose, and advocated for alongside the need for consistent
use of transparent governance tools and processes that are customized to best
respect local experiences within a collective and national context;
6. People impacted by marginalization such as racialized communities, migrant
workers including temporary foreign workers, and people living in poverty must
play an active role in co-creating research studies and sharing ownership of the
data in order to ensure a justice-based approach;
7. B.C. has experienced a lower than average illness and casualty rates primarily
because of leadership and decision making rooted in evidence based data;
8. Canada’s Chief Public Health Officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, has stated that the
federal health agency is working with Statistics Canada, along with the provinces
and territories on efforts to collect information on the race and ethnicity of
coronavirus patients. British Columbia’s Provincial Health Officer, Dr. Bonnie
Henry, has stated that the province is actively discussing the issue. To-date B.C.
has conducted a population health survey that will allow for disaggregated data
on perceived health and self-reported risk factors, symptoms and testing for
COVID-19. However direct data on COVID-19 cases and fatalities is only
disaggregated by age, sex and pre-existing health conditions;
9. Support for the collection of intersectional and race-based disaggregated data
have come from racialized communities, as well as health and advocacy
organizations, including but not limited to: The Canadian Public Health
Association, the Alliance for Healthy Communities, Hogan’s Alley Society, the
Federation of Black Canadians, Black in B.C. Mutual Aid, the Tulayan Filipino
Diaspora Society, the Yellowhead Institute, Canada’s federal, provincial and
territorial human rights commissions, and more.
10. The City of Vancouver’s Racial and Ethno-Cultural Advisory Committee passed
the following motion on June 4th, 2020:
THAT the City Council urges the Province of B.C. to take action on health
inequities by mandating the collection, use and analysis of disaggregated,
socio-demographic and race-based data in health and social service
sectors; and ensuring that the collection of data is led by critical race
researchers who identify as having racialized identities and experiences
to ensure that the data collection measures meaningfully contribute to

Council Meeting
Minutes, June 23, 2020 29
building a culturally safe health care system and is not used for any other
purposes.
THAT the committee calls on City Council pass a motion for the City of
Vancouver also to mandate the collection, use and analysis of
disaggregated, socio-demographic and race-based data in health and
social service sectors; and ensuring that the collection of data is led by
critical race researchers who identify as having racialized identities and
experiences to ensure that the data collection measures meaningfully
contribute to building a culturally safe health care system and is not used
for any other purposes.
11. In May 2020, Manitoba became the first province to track the ethnicity of COVID-
19 patients in an effort to detect inequities in the toll of the pandemic. Dr. Marcia
Anderson, a Cree-Anishinaabe public health doctor and vice-dean for Indigenous
health at the University of Manitoba said that, “Numbers on the ethnic makeup of
COVID-19 cases can help target public health messages and resources at
communities in the greatest need, as well as shine light on inequalities in
housing, labour market access and pre-existing health conditions.” The City of
Toronto, and the Province of Ontario, have followed suit.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council directs the Mayor to write to the
Provincial and Federal Ministers of Health requesting that the Provincial and Federal
Governments as well as local health authorities collect and report disaggregated data
including race, income, disability, and other social determinants of health that will inform
evidence-based health-care and social program interventions;
FURTHER THAT the data is collected with the intention of being understood as
indicators of systemic and structural oppression to identify root causes of disparity and to
inform action to address these root causes;
AND FURTHER THAT the data is co-owned, analyzed and interpreted with leadership
from racialized communities, and that Provincial and Federal Governments establish
ethical and governance guidelines and protocols specific to this data collection while
taking into account the protection of privacy and human rights.

5. Corner Stores in 21st Century Vancouver: Achieving Complete Communities and
Food-Friendly Neighbourhoods
MOVED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
SECONDED by Councillor Wiebe
WHEREAS
1. Vancouver committed to six big moves in its efforts to tackle climate change,
including the objective of Walkable Complete Communities where 90% of people
live within an easy walk/roll of their daily needs by 2030;
2. Vancouver is made up of a number of smaller neighbourhoods and communities
that reflect the distinct culture and character of the different areas of our city and
its diverse population (Note: it’s commonly understood to be 23 distinct
geographical areas in the city);
3. The City of Vancouver uses community plans to provide clear but flexible
frameworks to guide positive change and development in neighbourhoods, with
each plan considering long-range and shorter-term goals and the broader
objectives established for the entire city and at regional and provincial levels;
4. The City of Vancouver supports food-friendly neighbourhoods that provide all
residents with easy access to fresh, healthy foods, and the means to sustainably
dispose of food waste;
5. The Vancouver Food Strategy is the City’s plan to create a just and sustainable
food system for the city. It builds on years of food systems initiatives and
grassroots community development, considering all aspects of the food system;
6. Traditional corner stores played a key role in creating social connection in
neighbourhoods, as well as supporting daily needs. Traditional corner stores
have been declining in number for decades due to changing consumer patterns
and, critically, due to zoning restrictions;
7. To ensure food-friendly neighbourhoods are supported throughout the city,
Vancouver has committed to planning for the unique aspects of each area when
implementing the Food Strategy. “Healthy corner stores” figure prominently
among the requirements cited on the City’s website for building and maintaining
strong food systems across the city;i
8. Expressions of the City’s commitment to food-friendly neighbourhoods include
farmers markets that have grown dramatically in number and popularity in recent
years, with plans prior to the COVID-19 pandemic to continue to expand them to
supply locally-grown foods into neighbourhoods across the city;
9. Community Food Markets, i.e., small pop-up markets that sell fresh fruits,
vegetables, and other foods, represent another expression of the commitment to
food-friendly neighbourhoods. These markets are typically offered in
neighbourhoods with few food stores nearby, or where residents’ mobility may

Council Meeting
Minutes, June 23, 2020 31
prevent them from getting to stores. They emphasize low prices and good quality
and are indicative of a community need that is not being met in some of
Vancouver’s neighbourhoods. The Vancouver Food Strategy Goal to increase
Community Food Markets from four to 15 by the year 2020 has not been met;ii
10. At the February 23, 2016, Council Meeting, amendments to the Zoning and
Development By-law and Business License By-law regarding Urban Farming
were adopted on consent, including allowing Urban Farming - Class A in
residential districts and Urban Farming - Class B in commercial and industrial
districts;
11. As part of the Urban Farm Guidelines Review led by Arts, Culture, and
Community Services, staff are currently considering the implications of allowing
on-site sales from Urban Farm – Class A in residential zones;
12. The City has embarked on an Employment Lands and Economy Review to
develop a long-range land use policy plan that will ensure an appropriate supply
of land for businesses and jobs to support the future growth of our city’s
economy;
13. In November 2018, Council directed staff to undertake scoping to expedite
development of a city-wide plan. Subsequently, in November 2019, City Staff
embarked on the Vancouver Plan planning and engagement process and began
asking the public questions to better understand the challenges and priorities of
residents;iii
14. On March 19, 2020, the City of Vancouver declared a local state of emergency in
response to the global Covid-19 pandemic and is now developing a ReStart
Smart Vancouver plan to support economic and community recovery, with a
focus on supporting local business and rebuilding for the future emphasizing
access to community-based services;
15. In April 2020, the City of Vancouver declared farmers markets to be an essential
food source and took steps to ensure they could function as access points for
fresh and prepared foods;
16. During the height of COVID-19 restrictions, restaurants and cafes in many cities
began selling grocery and produce – often to support their business viability, but
also to address gaps in small-scale neighbourhood food access;
17. The world that emerges from the COVID-19 pandemic with more people working
from home than ever before, will inevitably result in a greater need for
neighbourhood amenities and local food infrastructure of coffee shops,
restaurants, services, and shopping including the need to access goods right in
their own neighbourhood. Local corner stores once filled this role in Vancouver
neighbourhoods, providing a place where locals bought fresh milk, cheese, some
staples, while also serving as a social gathering place for community;
18. Policies to retain existing small-scale, neighbourhood commercial retail spaces
(on and off of arterials) – ones that could help to achieve food-friendly

Council Meeting
Minutes, June 23, 2020 32
neighbourhoods and complete communities – can apply to different classes of
businesses including to some legally conforming and some non-conforming
businesses. The Grandview-Woodland Community Plan for example,
incorporated policy to support the retention of such small-scale spaces and staff
are currently exploring ways to expand this policy to other neighbourhoods. As a
first stage, an inventory of relevant sites in the city was undertaken in 2019 and is
currently being used as a basis to identify potential retention approaches.
Specific planning responses that may emerge could vary depending on the
status of a business as well as the prevailing zoning in the neighbourhood (i.e.,
RS, RT or RM). In the short-term, staff have recommended approval of site-
specific rezonings, such as the recent rezoning of the Caffe La Tana site on
Commercial Drive;
19. With reference to policies to support the creation of new small-scale
neighbourhood commercial retail spaces (on and off of arterials), ones that could
help to achieve food-friendly neighbourhoods and complete communities include
exploring ways to ensure convenient access to these daily needs as part of the
Complete Communities component of the Vancouver Plan and the Climate
Emergency Response (Big Move #1) – including looking at a variety of retail,
commercial service spaces and ‘third spaces’ where people spend time between
home (‘first’ space) and work (‘second’ space) to exchange ideas and build
relationships – a role corner stores once played in many neighbourhoods;
20. Staff have identified various elements of a work plan that would enable the
retention and creation of new small-scale neighbourhood commercial retail
spaces to achieve food-friendly neighbourhoods and complete communities,
namely:
• Engagement with various communities regarding neighbourhood assets
and a complete communities strategy;
• A review of the Zoning and Development By-law and related district
schedules;
• Addressing considerations around parking and loading, as well as other
COVID-19 recovery measures (e.g. street reallocation);
• Discussions with Development, Buildings, and Licensing around
permitting questions;
• Exploration of various potential solutions: e.g., amendments to the Zoning
and Development By-law, broader city-wide policies, possible rezoning
policies, and potential amendments to the Building Code;
21. The Vancouver Plan will ultimately set new directions to guide the city’s future
priorities into 2050 and beyond, including where new housing forms and
densities to satisfy the “missing middle” will be located and where local services
and 21st century corner stores will be needed; and

Council Meeting
Minutes, June 23, 2020 33
22. There are several examples of modern shops in the city, such as Le Marché St.
George in Mount Pleasant, the Federal Store on Quebec Street and the Wilder
Snail on Keefer Street, which each represent successful 21st Century
embodiments of the corner store experience and in many ways satisfy the role
corner stores once served and could serve again in new and reimagined forms
with appropriate neighbourhood-friendly zoning and supports to achieve the goal
of complete communities and food-friendly neighbourhoods.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to include, as a prominent
part of the Vancouver Plan public engagement process, questions related to the
emerging needs of communities and neighbourhoods in the city that could potentially be
met by a resurgence and reimagining of corner stores in a post-pandemic context,
consistent with the City’s commitment to achieving complete communities where
residents live within an easy walk/roll of their daily needs, as well as food-friendly
neighbourhoods that provide all residents with easy access to fresh, healthy foods, and
other retail and commercial amenities;
FURTHER THAT Council direct staff to report back in Fall 2020 with a preliminary
overview of early actions and potential policy directions Council could pursue in the
short-term and/or include as part of the Land and Economy Action Plan and the
Vancouver Plan process with respect to promoting food-friendly and local store
supported neighbourhoods, including neighbourhood-friendly zoning options and other
considerations such as options for small-scale commercial retail spaces on and off of
arterials, that could support a resurgence of corner stores and other local food amenities
and infrastructure as we shift into recovery and a new reality.
i Corner stores figure alongside Community and collective gardens, Farmers and community markets,
Food storage facilities, and Community composting facilities in achieving food-friendly neighbourhoods
and building and maintaining strong food systems across the city.
ii Community food markets address accessibility challenges that are sometimes associated with regular
farmers markets, such as physical access or affordability. Neighbourhood houses, BC Housing sites,
community centres, and other social serving organizations can organize and manage community food
markets. Community food markets can operate year-round. For market locations and times, visit the
market websites.
• Cedar Cottage Food Network External web site, opens in new tab - Saturdays year-round,
multiple locations
• Westside Community Food Markets External web site, opens in new tab - Thursdays, June
to September
• Gordon Neighbourhood House External web site, opens in new tab - Multiple locations and days

• Kiwassa Neighbourhood House External web site, opens in new tab - Often on the third Friday of

iii At the March 11, 2020, meeting of the Standing Committee on Policy and Strategic Priorities, Council
received a update on Phase 1 of the Vancouver Plan process. Background and context information was
included in the Staff presentation and the following points were noted as to why there is a need for a plan
and why now:
• It’s a moment in time for Vancouver
• High level of public anxiety about present and future

Council Meeting
Minutes, June 23, 2020 34
• The power of a unifying vision and action strategy
• Leveraging regional alignment and partnerships
• Framework for better decision-making
• Reforming ongoing civic engagement and building trust
The thoughts that have been gathered during the process are considered to be valuable and will guide
the next phase of the Vancouver Plan process and conversations on “The Future We Want.”

6. Community-based Crisis Management Through Understanding and De-escalation
MOVED by Councillor Fry
SECONDED by Councillor Dominato
WHEREAS
1. Jane Jacobs famously posited: “The public peace—the sidewalk and street
peace—of cities is not kept primarily by the police, necessary as police are. It is
kept primarily by an intricate, almost unconscious, network of voluntary controls
and standards among the people themselves, and enforced by the people
themselves.”; 1
2. The public peace can be challenged in particular through confrontation between
businesses and residents with street entrenched and people experiencing
homelessness. Concerns around crime and safety, neighbourhood decline, and
chronic street nuisance result in higher volumes of reactive police and non-
emergency calls, requests for more security, and compassion fatigue;
3. Street entrenched and homeless people have often experienced traumas
including intergenerational and childhood trauma; sexual and physical
victimization; physical and/or mental health challenges and addictions;
compounded by the trauma of experiencing homelessness, social isolation or
living in substandard housing; 2
4. In 2014, Vancouver City Council adopted the Caring for All Report 3 with a call to
action to support and advocate for safe and inclusive communities for all
residents:

Council Meeting
Minutes, June 23, 2020 35
“By making use of its full range of social development tools, from advocacy to
direct services, the City is well positioned to support partnerships to help
transform existing services and approaches in the arena of mental health and
addictions.”
5. In 2014, Vancouver City Council adopted A Healthy City For All strategy 4 with a
focus under Healthy Communities - Cultivating Connections, to:
“Examine regulations, policies, and processes that affect our relationships
with and between residents - past, present and future.”
6. The B.C. Ministry of Mental Health and Addictions’ ten-year mandate: A Pathway
to Hope (2017) 5, lays out a roadmap for making mental health and addictions
care better for people in British Columbia. The vision noted that B.C. has the
country’s highest rate of hospitalization due to mental illness and substance use;
and called for new collaborative partnerships with other stakeholders, highlighting
that:
“Stigma and affordability stand out as substantial systemic barriers to care.
Fear and misunderstanding often lead to prejudice against people with
mental illness, substance use and addiction challenges.”
7. Vancouver is at the centre of a mental health and addictions crisis, and as priority
actions the City of Vancouver 6 is working to:
a. promote healthy families and communities and protect child development;
b. make sure individuals have access to services that help them lead
healthier lives;
c. reduce the spread of deadly communicable diseases, and prevent drug
overdose deaths; and
d. recognize the need for peace and quiet, public order, and safety;
8. The 2016 Vancouver Police Mental Health Strategy 7 reports increasing
incidences of police interactions with people living with mental illness and often
struggling with substance abuse, that may not be receiving necessary medical
care and community support. The Strategy recognizes that some of these people
may be in a state of crisis, and includes a continuum of discretionary de-
escalation techniques including non-engagement, disengagement, and delaying
custody before proceeding with apprehension under the Mental Health Act or
arrest, with the caveat:
“History has shown that police interactions with persons living with mental
illness, and who are in crisis, sometimes have the potential for violence.
Occasionally, the mere presence of the police can elevate the tenor of the
interactions and complicate communication further.”
9. According to the B.C. Police Act 8, Vancouver “must bear the expenses
necessary to generally maintain law and order in the municipality.”;

Council Meeting
Minutes, June 23, 2020 36
10. Recent campaigns to reallocate police funding have highlighted that in
Vancouver, poverty, unstable housing, and mental health and addictions issues
represent decades of underfunding and gaps in provincial programming that has
resulted in increased policing;
11. On June 12, 2020, Premier John Horgan committed to a review of the B.C.
Police Act with a focus on increasing funding for health services, including mental
health and addictions, and funding for housing to address the issue of
homelessness;
12. First responders, non-profits, outreach workers, as well as shelter and housing
providers are all variously trained in some form of de-escalation techniques
through non-violent crisis intervention instruction and
trauma-informed workshops;
13. The City of Vancouver’s Arts, Culture and Community Services department,
currently support peer workers including service as community first responders,
in programs led by people with lived experience (mental health, substance use,
poverty); and in partnership with service and housing providers, provincial
partners and Vancouver Police Department;
14. Many cities are beginning to prioritize community-based crisis worker teams to
work with and independently of police in response to mental health crisis,
addictions and homelessness on the street;
15. In Eugene Oregon, the Crisis Assistance Helping Out on the Streets (CAHOOTS)
program handled 18% of the 133,000 calls to 911 in 2019, requesting police
backup only 150 times. The program also offers
de-escalation training that provides an overview of assessment and intervention
skills so that a lay-person can maintain personal safety and recognize when
someone might need help; 9
16. Increasingly the private sector, including BIAs and security providers 10, 11 are
learning de-escalation techniques through non-violent crisis intervention
instruction and trauma-informed workshops, and offering instruction to their
members. For example: Toronto’s Downtown Yonge BIA 12 holds information
sessions (facilitated by the Canadian Mental Health Association) for business
owners and managers who want to learn more about techniques for de-
escalation when individuals enter their establishments in distress; and
17. Many businesses and residents of Downtown Vancouver find themselves ill-
equipped for any sort of community-based crisis management or de-escalation,
and amidst increasing reports of conflict surrounding chronic street nuisance and
disorder, many Vancouverites don’t know who to call, how to help or how to get
help.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Vancouver City Council commit to supporting a community-based crisis
management strategy informed by understanding and

Council Meeting
Minutes, June 23, 2020 37
de-escalation, that promotes public safety and prioritizes non-policing
interventions where applicable and appropriate as a first response.
B. THAT Council direct staff to develop within the strategy a pilot
community-based crisis management program of public information, education,
and engagement that:
a. Is inclusive and accessible to residents and businesses in Vancouver;
b. Is informed by destigmatized, decolonial and anti-racist practice;
c. Is rooted in non-violent crisis intervention and de-escalation;
d. Is rooted in compassion and mutual understanding;
e. Is informed by best practices and lived experience;
f. Provides participants a better understanding of issues around mental
health, addictions and trauma;
g. Provides participants tools to help someone experiencing a mental
health of substance use emergency;
h. Considers place-making opportunities to counter impressions and
incidence of street disorder and chronic street nuisance; and
i. Reduces call volumes for police response, while redirecting more
appropriate resources as applicable;
FURTHER THAT this pilot program include input from Vancouver Coastal Health,
Vancouver Police Department, Canadian Mental Health Association, Ministry of
Mental Health and Addictions, and others (including but not limited to community
groups, peer supporters and BIAs) as applicable;
AND FURTHER THAT a preliminary work plan for the strategy and pilot program
inform 2021 Budget considerations.
C. THAT the Mayor on behalf of Council write to the Premier, Minister of Public
Safety, Minister of Mental Health and Addictions, Minister of Municipal Affairs
and Housing, and Minister of Poverty Reduction requesting increased investment
in social services directed to poverty, public safety, unstable housing, mental
health and addictions in Vancouver, as well as support for a community-based
crisis management strategy.

7. A Paradigm Shift in How We Partner With Local Businesses
MOVED by Councillor Wiebe
SECONDED by Councillor Fry
WHEREAS
1. On January 16, 2018, Council passed a motion entitled “Creating Optimal
Conditions for Small Businesses to Succeed and Thrive in the City of
Vancouver”, to support the fact that small businesses make up 95 per cent of all
businesses in Vancouver and are the backbone, and an important driver, of
Vancouver’s local economy, fostering local entrepreneurship and creating jobs;
2. On June 25, 2013, Council passed a motion entitled “Support Local Small
Businesses”, which called for the Vancouver Economic Commission to be asked
“to work with City staff, Vancouver BIAs and the Vancouver Board of Trade to
recommend immediate and long-term actions the City can take to support the
retention and growth of locally owned small businesses, as well as identify
opportunities to expedite recommendations within the Economic Action Strategy;
3. In November 2010, Councillors Woodsworth and Cadman called for Vancouver
City Council “to establish a ‘one stop shop’ to provide a single destination for
services and support for small businesses in Vancouver, including but not limited
to advice, referrals, and permits”, which was part of the Vancouver Service
Review;
4. On February 2, 2017, in response to various needs identified by the business
community, the City of Vancouver launched a “Commercial Renovation Centre”
aimed at helping new business owners navigate the process for licensing a small
business or renovating a commercial tenant space by providing hands-on
support related to regulations, permits and procedures;
5. On September 11, 2019, Council approved a new culture plan, Culture|Shift:
Blanketing the City in Arts and Culture, Making Space for Arts and Culture and
the Vancouver Music Strategy, that included an action to explore ways to help
artists, non-profits and event producers to navigate regulatory requirements in
partnership with the Commercial Renovation Center;
6. In 2020, the City of Vancouver quickly reacted to the COVID-19 pandemic by
improving online small business resources, creating a dedicated business line
and hosting small business roundtables; and
7. In response to COVID-19, staff in Planning, Urban Design and Sustainability, and
Business Planning and Project Support, launched a temporary Business
Communications and Support Office, as part of the Emergency Operations
Centre. This resource has been well used and provides a key platform to
assist/receive information from local businesses through the recovery period and
potentially beyond. In addition to consolidating government, City, and other
business support resources, PDS staff delivered over 100 customized/ concierge
type responses to local businesses.

Advisory Taskforce, to build on the Mayor’s small business round tables and identify the

NEW BUSINESS
1. Calling on the Province to Continue Their $300 a Month Supplement to Social
Assistance Recipients

Council Meeting
Minutes, June 23, 2020 42
MOVED by Councillor Swanson
SECONDED by Councillor Wiebe
WHEREAS
1. Social assistance rates ($760 a month for a single person on welfare and $1,183
for a person on disability) are far below the poverty line and make it virtually
impossible for recipients to eat and pay rent unless they are in social housing;
2. We are in the middle two crises (COVID-19 and poison drugs) that affect people
in poverty disproportionally;
3. The Provincial government has offered people on social assistance a $300 a
month top up for April, May and June;
4. The extra money helps reduce activities that put people at high risk of COVID-19
like working in the survival sex trade and other high risk activities;
5. The $300 a month extra still leaves people far below the poverty line of about
$20,000 a year;
6. One person who uses the Overdose Prevention Site on Hastings Street said
about the $300 top up, “I hope COVID-19 never ends. It’s been a relief to have
more resources. Life has become bearable;” and
7. When the COVID-19 eviction ban ends, many Downtown Eastside (DTES)
residents could be evicted from their Single Room Occupancy (SRO) rooms
which are being gentrified, and have no means to pay rent in more expensive
places without the extra $300.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT the Mayor, on behalf of Council, advocate
urgently and strongly to the Province of B.C. to keep the $300 top up for people on
social assistance until the Province raises social assistance rates to the poverty line, as
Council has previously asked for.
