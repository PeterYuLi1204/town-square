2. Urgent Pedestrian Safety Action at West 16th Avenue and Willow Street
MOVED by Councillor Dominato
SECONDED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
WHEREAS
1. On October 14, 2025, a serious collision occurred at the intersection of West
16th Avenue and Willow Street, in which a woman pushing a stroller and a child
were struck by a vehicle and hospitalized, highlighting ongoing safety risks for
pedestrians at this crossing;

Council Meeting
Minutes, October 21, 2025 23
2. Residents of the surrounding Fairview and South Cambie neighbourhoods have,
for many years, raised concerns about pedestrian safety along the 16th Avenue
corridor and specifically at Willow Street, citing limited sightlines, high vehicle
speeds, and the absence of a pedestrian-activated crossing signal;
3. Media reports indicate that the City has identified the intersection for a
pedestrian-safety upgrade, potentially involving a Rapid Flashing Beacon (RFB)
or similar improvement, currently planned for 2026;
4. Given the recent collision and heightened community concern, there is an urgent
need to accelerate safety measures and to review whether a full pedestrian-
activated traffic signal or other stronger intervention is warranted to protect
vulnerable road users; and
5. Enhancing pedestrian safety supports the City’s Vision Zero commitment to
eliminate traffic-related fatalities and serious injuries and aligns with the
Transportation 2040 and Healthy City strategies.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct the General Manager of Engineering Services to review on
an urgent basis, and where feasible, accelerating any planned pedestrian-safety
improvements at the intersection of West 16th Avenue and Willow Street,
including but not limited to the installation of a pedestrian-activated signal or
Rapid Flashing Beacon (RFB), enhanced crosswalk markings, advance signage,
and improved lighting.
B. THAT Council direct staff to implement interim safety measures, pending
permanent upgrades.
C. THAT Council affirm its commitment to advancing the City’s Vision Zero goals by
prioritizing pedestrian-safety improvements in locations where serious collisions
have recently occurred.
