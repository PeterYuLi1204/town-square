UNFINISHED BUSINESS
1. Safe and Inclusive Streets: Support for Community Crisis Management Through
Understanding and De-escalation
At the request of Councillor Fry, Council agreed to withdraw the motion below.
MOVED by Councillor Fry
SECONDED by Councillor Dominato
WHEREAS
1. Jane Jacobs famously posited: “The public peace—the sidewalk and street
peace—of cities is not kept primarily by the police, necessary as police are. It is
kept primarily by an intricate, almost unconscious, network of voluntary controls
and standards among the people themselves, and enforced by the people
themselves”; 1
2. Today, the complex relationship of gentrification and inclusion; poverty;
homelessness; mental health and addiction have emerged as a crisis all along
the West Coast and specifically Downtown Vancouver. This crisis often manifests
in conflict: Concerns around crime and safety, neighbourhood decline, and
chronic street nuisance. These conflicts in turn result in higher volumes of police
and non-emergency calls, calls for more security and pro-active engagement,
and compassion fatigue;
3. Chronic street nuisance is a particular and highly visible symptom of the larger
crisis and can been defined as conditions that (1) violate community norms
governing proper conduct in a particular public space (2) over a protracted period
of time (3) to the minor annoyance of passersby. A person perpetrates a chronic
street nuisance by persistently acting in a public space in a manner that violates
prevailing community standards of behavior, to the significant cumulative
annoyance of persons of ordinary sensibility who use the same spaces; 2
4. In 2019, Vancouver’s homelessness count was 2,223 people (up two per cent
from 2018), with 614 people living on the street; 3

Council Meeting
Minutes, November 26, 2019 21
5. Street entrenched and homeless people have often experienced trauma
including intergenerational and childhood trauma; sexual and physical
victimization; physical or mental health issues and addictions; compounded by
the trauma of living on the street or in substandard housing and of social
isolation; 4
6. First responders, non-profits, outreach workers, as well as shelter and housing
providers are all variously trained in some form of de-escalation techniques
through non-violent crisis intervention instruction and trauma informed
workshops;
7. Increasingly the private sector, including BIAs and security providers 5, 6 are
learning de-escalation techniques through non-violent crisis intervention
instruction and trauma-informed workshops, and offering instruction to their
members. For example: Toronto’s Downtown Yonge BIA 7 holds information
sessions (faciltated by the Canadian Mental Health Association) for business
owners and managers who want to learn more about techniques for
de-escalation when individuals enter their establishments in distress;
8. Many businesses and residents of Downtown Vancouver find themselves
ill-equipped for any sort of community crisis management or de-escalation, and
amidst increasing reports of conflict surrounding chronic street nuisance and
disorder, many Vancouverites don’t know who to call, how to help or get help;
9. In 2014, Vancouver City Council adopted the Caring for All Report 8 with the
following call to action: “The City clearly has a responsibility to support and
advocate for safe and inclusive communities for all residents… By making use of
its full range of social development tools, from advocacy to direct services, the
City is well positioned to support partnerships to help transform existing services
and approaches in the arena of mental health and addictions. As experienced
over the last year in the work of the Task Force, the City can also play an
important convening role to bring partners and citizens together to address
complex issues”;
10. In 2014, Vancouver City Council adopted A Healthy City For All strategy 9 with a
clear vision statement and within one of its three main areas of focus Healthy
Communities - Cultivating Connections, a clear call to action to Examine
regulations, policies, and processes that affect our relationships with and
between residents - past, present and future.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Vancouver City Council commit to safe and inclusive streets and
communities for enjoyment and use of all residents.
B. THAT Council direct staff to reach out to relevant partner agencies including
Vancouver Coast Health, Vancouver Police Department, Canadian Mental Health
Association, Ministry of Mental Health and Addictions, and others (including
community groups, peer supporters and BIAs) as applicable to develop a

Council Meeting
Minutes, November 26, 2019 22
workplan by Q2 2020 for a collaborative strategy around community engagement
for responding to and managing street disorder.
C. THAT a strategy of community engagement for responding to and managing
street disorder:
i. is inclusive and accessible, rooted in compassion and mutual
understanding;
ii. is informed by best practices and lived experience;
iii. is rooted in non-violent crisis intervention and de-escalation;
iv. provides participants a better understanding of issues around mental
health and trauma;
v. considers place-making opportunities to counter impressions and
incidence of chronic street nuisance; and
vi. reduces call volumes for police response, while redirecting more
appropriate resources as applicable.

Council Meeting
Minutes, November 26, 2019 29
MOVED by Councillor De Genova
SECONDED by Councillor Dominato
WHEREAS
1. The City of Vancouver issued an Information Bulletin on November 1, 2019,
stating that all vehicles with BC veteran license plates will be exempt from
parking fees from November 4 to 11 to mark Veterans’ Week. The reasons
included: “to recognize the service and dedication of Canadian military personnel
to our country”;
2. For many years the City of Vancouver has offered free parking on Remembrance
Day and during Veterans Week for vehicles with valid BC Veteran License Plates
parked at City of Vancouver parking meters, Easy Park lots, surface lots, and
Park Board operated parking facilities; including Stanley Park, Queen Elizabeth
Park, the Vancouver Aquatic Centre, and all Vancouver community centres;
3. The City of Surrey carried policy recommendations in a report dated
November 3, 2008, to adopt as a policy that vehicles bearing a "veteran" license
plate be granted complimentary parking on a year round basis at all City of
Surrey on street parking meters”;
i) The report and recommendations in the report titled Complimentary
Parking for Veterans at On-Street Parking Meters in Surrey, states that in
analysis of previous data, allowing Veterans to Park for free at on-street
parking meters, when comparing to subsequent years “there was no
significant impact on parking meter revenues”;
4. Examples of other municipalities across Canada and their commitment to
providing free parking for veterans include:
i) The City of Red Deer: The City provides a parking pass program for
Veterans (plates issued by all provinces). This program is administered
by the Canadian Legion and is free of charge to the Veteran unless a
replacement hang tag is required and then $20 is charged by the City.
The passes are good for five years and then must be re-applied for. This
pass allows the Veteran to park at a street parking meter for the time
restriction in that area. With the Legion’s administration, they ensure that
the person is a Veteran and is responsible for verification of any
documentation;
ii) The City of Regina, Saskatchewan allows a veteran to park at a meter if
they have a valid, properly displayed Veteran Design License Plate
issued by the Saskatchewan Government Insurance or the equivalent in
other provinces in Canada;
iii) The City of White Rock offers four hours a day of free parking in pay
parking areas for all veteran plates;

Council Meeting
Minutes, November 26, 2019 30
iv) The City of London, Ontario: Holders of a veteran’s license plate can park
at any on-street meter without depositing coins for the limit of the meter;
5. The ICBC website states “In recognition our Canadian veterans, we’ve created a
special plate to honour your service.” It lists the following requirements for
eligibility for veterans plates in B.C. as follows:
You are eligible to apply for veteran license plates if you own or lease an eligible
vehicle, and were honourably discharged from, or are currently serving in one of
the following:
i) WWII, Korea, Gulf War, the Balkan Wars, Afghanistan, or other UN
Peacekeeping Missions as a member of:
• The Canadian Armed Forces, or
• An Allied Force, or
• The Canadian or Allied War Time Merchant Navy
ii) A member of the Canadian Armed Forces, Regular or Reserves, who
successfully completed basic training
iii) UN or NATO Operations as a member of:
• The Canadian Armed Forces, or
• A UN or NATO Alliance Force serving in an Operation with the
Canadian Armed Forces
iv) Similarly qualified member of a British Commonwealth of Nations Armed
Force who are honourably discharged. Unfortunately, currently serving
members are not eligible.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to explore the possibility of a
process to allow eligible holders of a BC veterans license plate and current serving
members of the Canadian Forces to park their vehicle for free, subject to the time limits
already in place, at City of Vancouver parking meters, Easy Park lots, surface lots, and
Park Board operated parking facilities; including Stanley Park, Queen Elizabeth Park,
the Vancouver Aquatic Centre, and all Vancouver Community Centres;
FURTHER THAT Council direct staff to report back to Council by October 2020 with
recommendations and plans to deliver a process by November 11, 2020, for year-round
free parking for Veterans and current serving members of the Canadian Forces, at all
parking locations currently offered by the City of Vancouver during the week of
Remembrance Day.

manage parking demand, and incentivize the use of active transportation and
transit, and if exempting a particular group of private vehicles from metered
parking charges works directly against these goals and the Climate Emergency
Response goals.

4. City of Vancouver Responsible Divestment From Fossil Fuels
MOVED by Councillor Carr
SECONDED by Councillor Swanson
WHEREAS
1. The 2016, Union of BC Municipalities (UBCM) report, Primer on Fossil Fuel
Divestment and the Municipal Pension Plan (MPP), noted that “the MPP
imperative is to provide income security for retired members” and “Divestment
may compromise our investment strategy, increase risks and costs, and
negatively affect our clients’ investment returns”;
2. The B.C. Municipal Pension Plan is managed by British Columbia Investment
Management Corporation (“BCI”), an asset manager that encourages
responsible investing principles and is one of the founding members to the
United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment in 2006. BCI has noted that
their responsible investment approach is that being an investor and influencing
change is more effective than to divest. Other investment firms such as Caisse
Quebec are moving more aggressively to manage the impact and risks of fossil
fuels by reducing their holdings and encouraging investment in renewable
energy;
3. In May 2016, Council adopted a Responsible Investment Screening Process for
the City’s investment portfolio. The recommended screening process for
investing in Canadian banks and credit unions uses a typical structure of
environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) factors within a responsible
investing perspective;
4. In February of 2018 Council directed staff to report back on “what the
implications would be of the City of Vancouver moving its Municipal Finance
Authority (“MFA”) Investments into a fossil-free Socially Responsible Investment
(“SRI”) fund if such a fund is established by the MFA”. Staff reported in March
2018 that the City does not invest in any MFA pooled investment funds, and
therefore would not have MFA funds to move into a fossil-free SRI fund. Since
then, as the City has been a leader in the responsible investment area, staff have
engaged with MFA to support the creation of MFA pooled investment funds that
align with a fossil free approach and MFA has introduced two new Pooled High
Interest Savings Accounts that meet the short term investment needs of fossil
fuel free investors and will also be introducing an MFA Mortgage Fund which has
a small, greatly reduced exposure to fossil fuel companies. In addition, MFA has
been engaging with asset managers with the view of creating a new short-term
bond fund with a fossil fuel exclusion screen that would exclude securities of
companies directly involved in the extraction, processing and transportation of
coal, oil, or natural gas;
5. In 2017, the Chief Financial Officer of the City signed a letter from the
“Accounting for Sustainability (A4S)” initiative of Chief Financial Officers,
supporting climate-related financial disclosure. The letter specifically commits the

Council Meeting
Minutes, November 26, 2019 33
City to “affirm our commitment to support the voluntary recommendations” of the
Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”). In 2018, the City
was the first Canadian municipality to include climate-related financial
disclosures in its annual financial report. The City’s disclosure aligns or partially
aligns with TCFD recommendations, and will continue to improve over time as
the City responds to climate change, and as the field of climate-risk disclosure
evolves. The City is currently working with the City of Toronto, the City of
Montreal, and CPA (Chartered Professional Accountants) Canada to develop
and align standards for other municipalities to follow TCFD disclosures in their
financial reports;
6. In June 2018 the City developed its Green Bond Framework and engaged
Sustainalytics, a global leading provider of Socially Responsible strategies, to
provide a second-party opinion on the City’s alignment with the four core
components of the Green Bond Principles Framework. In October 2018 the City
issued its inaugural Green Bond of $85 million for capital projects that include
investments in renewable energy, energy efficiency, green buildings and clean
transportation (https://vancouver.ca/your-government/investor-relations.aspx);
7. Since then, with scientific validation of accelerating global warming and the need
to leave fossil fuel reserves in the ground, there has been increasing awareness
of the investment risk related to fossil fuel “stranded assets”. The October, 2018
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report calling for rapid
reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, with a window of little more than a
decade to avert catastrophic impacts of climate change, has shifted the rationale
for divesting from an ethical or moral consideration to a financial and fiduciary
argument;
“Divestment, once strictly a moral call to action, is now also seen as the
only prudent financial response to climate risk” 350.org
8. In January of 2019 Council voted unanimously to recognize a global climate
emergency and local climate crisis;
9. In June of 2019, noting a B.C. government report that projects the City of
Vancouver will have to spend $1 billion this century to mitigate rising sea levels,
Council approved a motion to write to “the 20 fossil fuel companies with the
highest percentage of greenhouse gas emissions to ask that they be accountable
for their share of climate emergency costs;
10. In October of 2019, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, told delegates at a
climate change summit in Copenhagen that big investors such as insurers and
pension funds should cut their investments and focus on renewable energy
sources instead;
11. Divestment is now a rapidly growing worldwide movement. The total sum of
global funds committed to fossil fuel divestment was $52 billion in 2014, $8 trillion
in 2018 and $11 trillion in 2019. In 2019, more than 1,110 funds (including wealth
funds, banks, cities, pension funds and insurance firms) have made divestment

Council Meeting
Minutes, November 26, 2019 34
commitments, including Norway’s $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund, the world’s
largest. Caisse Quebec – Quebec’s equivalent to B.C.’s pension fund manager –
has more than $285-billion in assets under management and says it believes it is
the first North American institutional investor to set a carbon target covering all of
its asset classes;
“There are going to be stranded assets associated with climate change.
We don’t want to get caught in those stranded assets … We’re looking for
opportunities because we think it’s good risk management to, over time,
exit those.”
Michael Sabia, President and CEO of Caisse Quebec;
12. The cities-led responsible investment movement is growing. More and more
cities around the world, including New York City, Paris, London, Oslo, Sydney,
Melbourne, Aukland, San Francisco and Seattle, are manifesting their climate
leadership through making a divestment commitment. To support cities in
exploring and developing their divestment and sustainable investment strategies,
the global Cities Climate Leadership Group C40, in close partnership with
London and New York City, launched the Divest/Invest Forum in September
2018. The Forum is open to any city that seeks learn more about divestment,
sustainable investment, and other climate-responsive financial strategies; no
actions or commitments are required as a prerequisite to joining.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT City Council direct staff to review and report
back on the following items:
A. A plan that includes defining divestment, options and timelines for how the City
could fully divest from fossil fuels, building on divestment measures taken to date
as well as leading practices related to fossil fuel free investment portfolios.
B. Opportunities to continue to engage the Municipal Finance Authority to create a
fossil fuel free fund that would enable other B.C. municipalities to invest in such a
fund.
C. Bringing a motion to Council for the 2020 meetings of the Lower Mainland Local
Government Association and the Union of B.C. Municipalities (UBCM) to re-
examine the 2016 UBCM Primer on Fossil Fuel Divestment and the Municipal
Pension Plan report, in light of globally changing investment and divestment
strategies.
D. Tasking and resourcing the Vancouver Economic Commission to work with local
businesses and financial regulators to provide and promote resources and
guidelines for local businesses and other private institutions to understand and
apply TCFD (Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures) decision-
making in their work.
E. Evaluating the benefit of the City and Vancouver Economic Commission
participating on the C40 Invest/Divest forum, including attending its March 2020
workshop.

Council Meeting
Minutes, November 26, 2019 35
F. The Mayor, on behalf of Council and the City of Vancouver write to the B.C.
Municipal Pension Plan requesting a risk assessment of the plan’s investments
based on carbon exposure, asking the Plan to advise the City on what steps are
being taken to measure and mitigate these risks, and urging the Plan to consider
the long-term impact of global climate emergency and local climate crisis due to
investments in fossil fuel assets and to redeploy funds into green and renewable
assets that are necessary for a sustainable future.
G. The Mayor, on behalf of Council and the City of Vancouver, send a letter to the
Province of BC to encourage them to follow the examples of Canadian
municipalities in developing a model for crown corporations and provincial
agencies to include financial statement disclosures aligned with the TCFD (Task
Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures).
H. The Mayor, on behalf of the City of Vancouver, a C40 City, sign the Global Green
New Deal pledge which was signed by the other C40 mayors at their meeting in
Copenhagen in October of 2019. That pledge includes an “urgent, fundamental
and irreversible transfer of global resources away from fossil fuels and into action
that averts the climate emergency.”
