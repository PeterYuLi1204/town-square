2. CD-1 Rezoning: 2156-2174 West 14th Avenue
At the Public Hearing on November 12 and 14, 2024, Council closed the speakers list and
receipt of public comments and referred questions to staff, debate and decision to the Council
meeting on November 26, 2024, as Unfinished Business.
Prior to beginning the item, Councillor Dominato advised she had reviewed the proceedings of
the Public Hearing she missed and would therefore be participating in questions to staff,
discussion, debate and decision.
Council also had before it a memorandum from the General Manager, Planning, Urban Design
and Sustainability dated November 8, 2024, entitled “CD-1 Rezoning: 2156-2174 West 14th
Avenue – Amendment to Draft CD-1 By-law”, which noted that after referral, staff determined
that a correction was required to the draft by-law to increase the stated building height for the
proposed rooftop amenity space and mechanical appurtenances from 58 m to 62 m, due to an
error in the original calculation of the building height. The proposed change is as follows (with
bold to replace strikethroughs and identify new provisions):
7.2 Despite section 7.1 of this by-law and the building height regulations in section 10 of the
Zoning and Development By-law, if the Director of Planning permits common rooftop
amenity space or mechanical appurtenances including elevator overrun and rooftop
access structures, the height of the portion of the building with permitted common
rooftop amenity space or mechanical appurtenances must not exceed 58 m 62 m.
Staff concluded that the change in the above-noted heights does not alter the proposed form of
development shown in Appendix D of the Referral Report dated September 24, 2024, entitled
“CD-1 Rezoning: 2156-2174 West 14th Avenue” and no changes are required to the conditions
of approval as noted in Appendix B of the same referral report.
Staff recommend that Council approve the Recommendation for Public Hearing subject to this
yellow memorandum.
Staff from Planning, Urban Design and Sustainability responded to questions.
