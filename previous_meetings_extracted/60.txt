COUNCIL MEMBERS’ MOTIONS
1. Request for Review of School Liaison Officer Program
The Committee heard from two speakers who spoke in support of the motion, three speakers
who spoke in opposition of the motion, and one speaker who spoke to other aspects of the
motion.
MOVED by Councillor Fry
SECONDED by Councillor Bligh

WHEREAS

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, July 23, 2025 7
1. The School Liaison Officer (SLO) program in Vancouver was previously
eliminated in 2021 after careful consideration;
2. The Vancouver School Board’s review of the School Liaison Officer program,
conducted by Argyle Communications (the Argyle study), was completed, and
due to predominantly Indigenous and Black voices articulating that they felt
unsafe and/or it did not foster a safe school environment, it was eliminated;
3. The current SLO program has been revised but continues to raise concerns. It is
understood that officers are now plain-clothed, have concealed weapons, and
must engage in special training such as de-escalation techniques with special
considerations towards mental health, while recognizing that student safety is a
priority;
4. As per the Argyle study, 60% of Black students disagreed or strongly disagreed
that SLO contributed to a sense of safety in schools;
5. As per the Argyle study, 33% of Indigenous students disagreed or strongly
disagreed that SLO contributed to a sense of safety in schools.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT, per the Racial and Ethno-Cultural Equity
Advisory Committee, Council express its concern regarding the renewal of the School
Liaison Officer (SLO) Program in Vancouver Schools without a full review;
FURTHER THAT, per the Racial and Ethno-Cultural Equity Advisory Committee, Council
request the Vancouver School Board conduct a new independent review of the School
Liaison Officer (SLO) program by a neutral organization with expertise in equity and
policing, with a focus on centering equity-deserving communities who have historically
expressed distrust towards police (particularly Indigenous and Black communities).

review’s findings be completed and shared publicly by the end of 2025.
amended
During discussion on Members’ Motion 1, Councillor Bligh rose on a point of order under section

Following the vote, Councillor Bligh rose on a point of order under section 8.7(b) of the
Procedure By-law, identifying a procedural issue that since the original amendment was ruled

suspended – thus jeopardizing the existence of Vancouver’s renowned and
unique arts and culture scene;
4. Anticipated contributions to the arts and culture sector from FIFA, in
consideration of their World Cup 2026 presence in Vancouver, have not been
forthcoming; further, FIFA has upended anticipated attendance and participation
in key arts and culture events in the city during that time, posing a further threat
to arts and culture sustainability;
5. The City’s Culture|Shift (2020–2029) strategy outlines five strategic directions —
including increased investment, cultural equity, and creating new models for
securing space — and explicitly calls for the creation of an Arts, Culture &
Creative City Navigator and a cultural-space acquisition fund;
6. Vibrant Vancouver: Council’s Strategic Priorities 2023–20263 position culture as
essential to building a “Vibrant and Diverse City”, pledging to ensure Vancouver

communities, large-scale events, and neighbourhood revitalization, including in
cultural districts such as Chinatown;
7. Vancouver’s cultural sector generates over $6 billion in GDP and 24,000+ jobs
across Metro Vancouver (StatsCan Culture Satellite Account, 20224), yet
receives just 4% of the City’s operating budget and has seen only modest grant
increases below inflation;
8. The estimated replacement cost of the City’s aging and disappearing cultural
infrastructure exceeds $900 million (City of Vancouver Cultural Spaces Inventory,
2023), yet current capital investments remain inadequate to meet the scale of
loss and need.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
THAT at the urgent recommendation of the Arts & Culture Advisory Committee,
Vancouver City Council direct staff to consider and report back prior to 2026 budget
considerations with means and methods to substantially and sustainably increase
support for the arts and culture sector by exploring strategies including but not limited to:
i. Increased Funding strategies, such as:

4 Government of Canada | Culture Satellite Account
https://www.canada.ca/en/canadian-heritage/corporate/publications/general-publications/culture-satellite-
account.html

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, July 23, 2025 11
• Increasing cultural operating grants — beginning with a suggested 10%
uplift in 2026 — and working towards establishing a $40,000 minimum for
operating grants to stabilize small, equity-seeking organizations, aligning
with Culture|Shift D1 G1 & D3 G1;
• Exploring minimal taxes or surcharges (0.05%) on hotels, liquor, sales,
empty buildings, etc. that could be dedicated to arts and culture funding;
• Reviewing other municipal funding strategies for sustained investment,
such as Los Angeles County’s 1% for the Arts on public construction
projects.
ii. Infrastructure and Cultural Spaces supports, such as:
• Exploring incentives to let empty spaces be turned into temporary arts and
culture spaces, rather than sitting vacant. This could include revising
temporary use permit processing, and other strategies working in tandem
with other committees focused on similar permit streamlining;
• Recommending the Province revise the Assessment Act to create a new
classification for arts and culture spaces;
• Piloting an Arts, Culture & Creative City Navigator desk within
Development, Buildings & Licensing to streamline permitting, liquor, and
special-event approvals for artists and cultural non-profits, and promote
collective marketing to boost tourism and public awareness (Culture|Shift
action A3);
• Exploring the creation of a Festivals Vancouver Fund, in collaboration with
the existing/emerging Festivals Committee, and based on Ottawa Festival
Network: an ongoing, self-sustaining fund to support Vancouver’s myriad
and vibrant grassroots arts and culture festivals, to provide increased
visibility and sustainability and foster jobs and tourism. The fund could
serve as a single, long-term support strategy, rather than constant
emergency-response requests from multiple organizations from public
funds.
iii. Data gathering to drive investment, such as:
• Commissioning an annual Cultural Infrastructure & Economic Impact
Report — integrating GIS mapping of cultural spaces, replacement-cost
modelling, tourism metrics, and GDP/job data — to inform budget
deliberations and align with Council’s “Good Government” priority. This
could include compiling information and data from previously commissioned
reports;

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, July 23, 2025 12
• Creating a Community-Led Cultural Land Trust seeded with $20 million in
the 2026 Capital Budget and matching City land, to secure at-risk spaces
and leverage federal/provincial funds (aligns with Culture|Shift D4 G3);
• Introducing a 1% Cultural Space Contribution on new commercial and
mixed-use floor area city-wide (mirrors CAC/DCL framework) with revenues
dedicated to implementing the Making Space cultural-space targets;
• Adopting a ticket surcharge on events at large venues to feed a Grassroots
Venue Resilience Fund for repairs, acoustics, and accessibility upgrades in
spaces under 500 seats;
• Piloting an Arts, Culture & Creative City Navigator desk within
Development, Buildings & Licensing by Q4 2025 to streamline permitting,
liquor, and special-event approvals for artists and cultural non-profits, and
promote collective marketing to boost tourism and public awareness
(Culture|Shift action A3);
• Facilitating annual diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and accessibility
self-audits from all City-funded cultural organizations and tie future grant
increases to demonstrable progress (Culture|Shift D3 G1).

with public events and festivals under the fund.
D. THAT Council request the Mayor write a letter to the federal

culture sector, and to advocate for the restoration and expansion
of funding programs that reflect the sector’s cultural and economic

3. Building BC’s Creative Advantage: A New Immigration Pathway for Cultural
Entrepreneurs
The Committee heard from six speakers who spoke in support of the motion, one speaker who
spoke in opposition of the motion, and one speaker who spoke to other aspects of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Montague
SECONDED by Councillor Dominato
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. British Columbia is a national leader in the cultural and creative industries, with
over 89,000 people working in the sector and a GDP contribution exceeding
$6.7 billion in 2022, surpassing traditional sectors such as forestry and
hospitality;
2. Vancouver’s creative economy — including live events, music, nightlife, film,
visual effects (VFX), gaming, and digital media — is a cornerstone of the city’s
cultural identity and contributes billions annually to British Columbia’s economy,
supporting tens of thousands of skilled, well-paying jobs;
3. Cities such as Los Angeles and London have surged ahead by leveraging
targeted international talent strategies — including specialized designations for
globally recognized creators and entrepreneurs — leading to job creation, new
businesses, and strong returns on investment;
4. Canada currently lacks a dedicated and modern immigration stream for
exceptional creative professionals and/or culturally innovative entrepreneurs,
forcing them to navigate general skilled-worker pathways that often disadvantage
individuals with non-traditional education, freelance careers, or project-based
work histories;
5. This lack of an immigration stream for exceptional creative professionals has led
to missed opportunities in talent recruitment, retention, and long-term cultural
investment, as foreign creative professionals often enter Canada on temporary
work permits without a clear path to permanent residence, and many Canadian-
trained creatives leave the country for more supportive jurisdictions;
6. Creating a specialized immigration pathway for people with exceptional creative
talent would help grow local industries, support new businesses, boost tourism,
and strengthen cultural exchange. It would bring long-term social and economic
benefits by connecting world-class creative leaders with communities across
Canada; and
7. In B.C., the Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) framework offers an effective
mechanism for piloting a new immigration stream aligned with provincial needs
and economic development strategies, where the infrastructure and networks to

support such a program are already well established through organizations such
as Creative BC, the BC Arts Council, and industry associations.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council request the Province to develop a pilot Creative Talent Stream
under the British Columbia Provincial Nominee Program (BC PNP), that would
allow world-class creative professionals and cultural entrepreneurs to establish
long-term economic roots in British Columbia and contribute to the province’s
creative economy;
FURTHER THAT Council request the Province to design the pilot program in
consultation with Creative BC, Music BC, DigiBC, and other relevant cultural
sector partners to create an industry-informed nomination mechanism for global
creative leaders.
B. THAT Council urge the Province to work in partnership with the federal
government, particularly Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC),
to secure a dedicated allocation of nomination spaces under the BC PNP for
extraordinary creative talent, with a view to expanding the program nationally
based on pilot outcomes.
C. THAT Council request that the Mayor write to the Province of British Columbia
(Ministers of Housing and Municipal Affairs; Tourism, Arts, Culture and Sport;
and Jobs, Economic Development and Innovation), expressing Council’s support
for the development of a pilot Creative Talent Stream under the British Columbia
Provincial Nominee Program (BC PNP) to enable creative industries to identify
and retain globally recognized talent crucial to B.C.’s and the City of Vancouver’s
economic resilience, export growth potential, and domestic job creation.
D. THAT Council direct that a resolution be submitted to the Union of BC
Municipalities (UBCM) advocating for the Province to develop a pilot Creative
Talent Stream under the British Columbia Provincial Nominee Program (BC
PNP), aimed at attracting and retaining individuals with demonstrated
extraordinary ability or high potential in creative industries as per the intent of this
motion:
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT the City of Vancouver submit the

4. Closing a Tenant Relocation and Protection Policy Loophole to Protect More
Tenants
The Committee heard from two speakers who spoke in support of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Orr
SECONDED by Councillor Maloney
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. The city-wide Tenant Relocation and Protection Policy is intended to protect
tenants in long-term rental housing, including:
• Purpose-built rental housing;
• Buildings with rentals above commercial spaces; and
• Multiple conversion dwellings with five or more units.
2. But in some rare edge cases, vagueness in the existing Policy’s language has
required staff to interpret this to not include builds that were originally built as
strata units, but later purchased by a single buyer and operated as rental
housing; and
3. This means that some tenants who are living in long-term rental housing,
including rentals above commercial spaces, are not protected by the TRPP,
against the spirit of the Policy.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
THAT Council direct staff to report back with a proposed amendment to the Tenant
Relocation and Protection Policy to clarify that any building that operates its housing
units as rentals under a single landlord is “primary” rental stock and those tenants are
eligible for compensation under the Policy.

5. Improving Public Safety by Protecting Supportive Modular Housing
The Committee heard from 16 speakers who spoke in support of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Orr
SECONDED by Councillor Maloney
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. The City has a duty to protect the health, safety, and well-being of all residents,
including vulnerable populations experiencing homelessness;

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, July 23, 2025 25
2. Evidence consistently shows that chronic homelessness is associated with
higher rates of emergency service calls, including fire, police, and paramedic
responses, as well as increased risk of both victimization and criminalization for
people who are homeless;
3. Vancouver’s Supportive Modular Housing sites provide cost-effective and
dignified shelter with on-site health and social supports, reducing the strain on
emergency services and improving outcomes for individuals in need of support;
4. Supportive modular housing can last for 30-40 years, and it is more cost effective
to maintain and protect existing housing than to replace it with new shelter rate
construction;
5. There are very few appropriate options to move supportive modular housing
residents into if their buildings close, and when appropriate housing is found, it
means that unit is no longer available for someone who is still currently
homeless;
6. There is a rapidly growing number of Vancouver residents who desperately need
social housing they can afford, including over 3,200 people on social assistance
who are currently without a fixed address;
7. The Vancouver Zoning Bylaw states in Section 11.3.4.3: “A development permit
for temporary modular housing must be limited in time to a maximum of 5 years,
unless otherwise extended in writing for up to an additional 5 years by the
Director of Planning."; and
8. Land leases for about 600 units of modular housing will expire by 2031 unless
Council changes the bylaw to allow the housing to stay longer.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to bring forward for Council's consideration as soon as
possible a referral report to amend the Zoning Bylaw to allow supportive modular
housing to remain on its current sites for the life of the building.
B. THAT when a supportive modular building has to be moved because the site has
another imminent use, the city will make every effort, including considering
city-owned lots and parking lots, to move the existing modular buildings to a new
site.

THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. Staff have indicated that a 6 or 7 percent property tax increase is required for
2026 in order to sustain city operations, but Vancouver City Council, on June 18,
2025, directed staff to explore property tax options which are as low as 2.5% or
0% for 2026;
2. Vancouver’s vital public services are at risk of being under-funded without
continued and reliable sources of revenue that include property taxes and other
revenues;
3. Vancouver has a variety of methods to collect revenues, which impact different
groups and household incomes in different ways;
4. During an affordability crisis, we must provide relief first and foremost to those
most in need, and not give handouts to the wealthy and well-connected.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council request staff to produce a report that is
delivered concurrently with the previously requested report on potential 2026 tax rates
that will:
i. Identify existing or new sources of revenue which primarily impact people
with higher incomes in Vancouver, which are suitable for deployment as
early as the 2026 budget; and
ii. Compare and contrast the existing sources of revenue the city collects
and review existing research from other jurisdictions to provide a high-
level analysis on which income groups different revenue sources tend to
impact the most.

7. Streamlining the Provision of Duplex and Multiplex Housing in R1-1 Zoning
The Committee heard from nine speakers who spoke in support of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Maloney
SECONDED by Councillor Orr
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. Vancouver is a provincial and national leader in enabling laneway homes,
multiplexes, and other types of small-scale multi-unit housing that support a
greater diversity of housing types, offered at a wider array of price points, within
existing neighbourhoods;
2. Significant construction-cost escalations and broad economic uncertainty are
challenging Vancouver homebuilders to cost-effectively deliver the city’s needed
housing;
3. The single-family detached home is the most expensive and least climate-
adapted housing form, but it enjoys a considerable advantage over duplexes,
multiplexes, and other types of multifamily housing with respect to permit
approval time and simplicity of permit requirements;
4. A proposed multiplex in R1-1 development currently requires separate reviews
for the Development Permit and Building Permit. This can easily add three to six
months of additional approval time when compared to a single-family detached
home or a simple laneway home;
5. Development Permits are time-consuming for both staff and applicants. Some
applicants report that assessment decisions can at times feel subjective and/or
arbitrary when compared to Outright zoning rules;
6. Vancouver’s R1-1 zoning does not currently allow a new multiplex on a lot
without a lane, or on a lot that is shorter than 30.4 metres in length or smaller
than 306 square metres in area;
7. The city requires builders who wish to develop multiplex housing on unusually
shaped lots, double-fronting arterial lots, and/or lots with lane easements to
pursue a time-consuming application process via the Board of Variance;

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, July 23, 2025 28
8. Builders report that the city’s six-strata-unit cap and minimum subdivision lot
sizes make the development of multiplexes on estate9 sized R1-1 lots
economically unfeasible in many instances. While the city provides exclusions for
bike parking, builders report that in practice, they do not always improve project
feasibility;
9. Allowing greater flexibility in the types of lots on which gentle-density housing can
be built will enable homeowners and small- and medium-sized homebuilders to
more readily develop such housing;
10. The City of Burnaby currently allows multiplexes with higher floor space ratio
than those in Vancouver. Burnaby’s regulations allow four floors (three above
grade) and 50% site coverage, with no limit on floor space ratio;
11. Given the high cost of land, current regulations that require proposed multiplexes
to meet 1.0 floor space ratio significantly constrain the financial viability of many
such projects. An allowance for higher density, or higher unit counts per site,
would open up additional locations to multifamily housing; and
12. The City is planning a periodic review of its R1-1 zoning.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff as part of its forthcoming
review of R1-1 zoning, to:
Explore and report back on the feasibility and implications of amending R1-1 zoning to:
i. Expedite multiplex permitting by simplifying the approval process. This could
be done through a combined Development Permit / Building Permit process,
or Outright zoning (similar to what is used for single-family detached homes
and laneway homes) on R1-1 residential projects with a frontage of 100 feet
or less;
ii. Allow multiplexes on lots that are smaller than current minimum size
thresholds, or on lots without lane access;
iii. Enable multiplex development on large lots by allowing subdivision and/or
higher unit counts to achieve appropriately sized multiplex units, potentially
via amendments to the Subdivision By-law (No. 5208);
iv. Consider granting the Director of Planning discretion in a wider range of
situations for multiplexes proposed on non-conforming, small, or unusual lots;
v. Remove “half storey” massing requirements for upper floors on duplexes
to allow for smaller-footprint buildings with more green space;
vi. Allow bicycle parking exclusions to scale with lot sizes; and
9 Vancouver Subdivision Bylaw, Schedule A, Table 1, includes large lot categories C (50’ min frontage)
through G (150’ min frontage) as compared to lot category A that allows subdivision down to 30’ frontage.

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, July 23, 2025 29
vii. Consider altering Vancouver’s R1-1 zoning to be at least as permissive as
the City of Burnaby’s equivalent zoning, the R1 Small-Scale Multi-Unit
Housing District.

8. Realizing the Full Potential of Exceptional Lands in Vancouver
The Committee heard from five speakers who spoke in support of the motion and two speakers
who provided general comments on the report.
MOVED by Mayor Sim
SECONDED by Councillor Klassen
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. On February 1, 2023, Vancouver City Council unanimously adopted the motion
entitled “Industrial Modernization and Intensification Framework Development
Process Update”, directing staff to report back with strategies to advance the
modernization, intensification, and protection of Vancouver’s industrial and
employment lands;
2. The February 2023 motion called for staff to address a number of issues,
including opportunities to accelerate the Intensification Framework’s
development, policy mechanisms to limit speculation, and regulatory tools to
preserve and enhance the city’s limited industrial land base;
3. On November 14, 2023, Council received a report titled “Industrial Modernization
and Intensification Framework – Updates and Policy Recommendations” (RTS
15772), which provided policy updates, a review of market conditions, and
recommended planning work for specific industrial areas, including Railtown and
South Vancouver;
4. City staff have received an increasing number of non-compliant rezoning
applications and inquiries seeking to include housing (often high-density
residential) on industrial and employment lands in addition to, and while
preserving, the ongoing industrial uses, prompting the need for a framework to
evaluate such proposals;
5. The Province of British Columbia’s Transit-Oriented Areas (TOA) legislation
requires local governments to increase housing density around SkyTrain and
major transit corridors, increasing the necessity for a policy review of industrial
lands near rapid transit;
6. Council has repeatedly reaffirmed the importance of industrial and employment
lands to Vancouver’s long-term economic resilience, affordability, and job

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, July 23, 2025 30
diversity, especially lands that are strategically located near rapid transit and
within urban centres;
7. Staff have been received inquires or applications on several exceptional sites
with unique industrial characteristics, and this presents an important opportunity
to request site-specific analysis on strategically situated properties of citywide
interest. These sites include:
• The former Molson site, a large, underutilized property with significant
redevelopment potential;
• The former industrial sites near Main Street and Terminal Avenue in close
proximity to the new St. Paul’s Hospital and other emerging mixed-use
and transit-oriented areas;
• Railtown, a unique industrial and creative district requiring tailored policy
guidance to support job space retention and cultural economy integration;
• Marine Gateway, a rapid transit-served, mixed-use area with employment
potential requiring clear direction on the future of adjacent industrial-
designated sites;
• The Mount Pleasant industrial area, a centrally located employment
district with sites within the provincially-mandated TOAs, where
modernized policy guidance is needed to support innovative tech clusters,
light industry, and creative economy uses while carefully considering
residential uses.
8. The City of Vancouver has established ambitious housing goals in the Vancouver
Plan, the Housing Vancouver Strategy, and in response to new provincial
legislation, which collectively aim to accelerate the delivery of diverse, affordable,
and transit-oriented housing options. Achieving these goals necessitates
thoughtful integration of housing objectives with industrial and employment land
protection policies.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to provide site-specific information regarding the future
role, planning considerations, and policy implications for the following exceptional
sites and report back on or before October 31, 2025:
i. The former Molson site;
ii. The former industrial sites near Main Street and Terminal Avenue;
iii. The Railtown industrial district;
iv. The Marine Gateway area; and
v. The Mount Pleasant industrial area.
FURTHER THAT staff continue to process without delay existing and new
applications for the exceptional sites outlined above;

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, July 23, 2025 31
AND FURTHER THAT, following the analysis of site-specific information
regarding the future role, planning considerations, and policy implications of the
exceptional sites listed above, staff prepare concurrent submissions to Metro
Vancouver to remove any recommended sites from the Industrial Land Reserve
in the fall.
B. THAT staff be requested to provide:
• Analysis of how each site supports the goals of the Industrial
Modernization and Intensification Framework, the Vancouver Plan, the
Housing Vancouver Strategy, and the Metro Vancouver Regional
Industrial Lands Strategy;
• Options for future land use directions that maintain or intensify
employment-generating capacity while appropriately accommodating the
potential for housing and public amenities such as green space,
childcare, community and recreation facilities, and arts and culture
spaces;
• Assessment of the sites’ relationship to major transit infrastructure and
opportunities for integrated job space intensification; and
• Any preliminary recommendations for area-specific planning, policy
amendments, or further study;
FURTHER THAT staff include this expanded analysis within the broader context
of their reporting on citywide industrial land supply, pressures on industrial and
employment lands, and protection strategies, and continue to prioritize the
advancement of a modernized, transit-oriented employment lands policy
framework that supports a diverse and sustainable economy.

FINAL MOTION AS APPROVED
WHEREAS
1. On February 1, 2023, Vancouver City Council unanimously adopted the motion
entitled “Industrial Modernization and Intensification Framework Development
Process Update”, directing staff to report back with strategies to advance the
modernization, intensification, and protection of Vancouver’s industrial and

employment lands;
2. The February 2023 motion called for staff to address a number of issues,
including opportunities to accelerate the Intensification Framework’s
development, policy mechanisms to limit speculation, and regulatory tools to
preserve and enhance the city’s limited industrial land base;
3. On November 14, 2023, Council received a report titled “Industrial Modernization
and Intensification Framework – Updates and Policy Recommendations” (RTS
15772), which provided policy updates, a review of market conditions, and
recommended planning work for specific industrial areas, including Railtown and
South Vancouver;
4. City staff have received an increasing number of non-compliant rezoning
applications and inquiries seeking to include housing (often high-density
residential) on industrial and employment lands in addition to, and while
preserving, the ongoing industrial uses, prompting the need for a framework to
evaluate such proposals;
5. The Province of British Columbia’s Transit-Oriented Areas (TOA) legislation
requires local governments to increase housing density around SkyTrain and
major transit corridors, increasing the necessity for a policy review of industrial
lands near rapid transit;
6. Council has repeatedly reaffirmed the importance of industrial and employment
lands to Vancouver’s long-term economic resilience, affordability, and job
diversity, especially lands that are strategically located near rapid transit and
within urban centres;
7. Staff have been received inquires or applications on several exceptional sites
with unique industrial characteristics, and this presents an important opportunity
to request site-specific analysis on strategically situated properties of citywide
interest. These sites include:
• The former Molson site, a large, underutilized property with significant
redevelopment potential;
• The former industrial sites near Main Street and Terminal Avenue in close
proximity to the new St. Paul’s Hospital and other emerging mixed-use
and transit-oriented areas;
• Railtown, a unique industrial and creative district requiring tailored policy
guidance to support job space retention and cultural economy integration;
• Marine Gateway, a rapid transit-served, mixed-use area with employment
potential requiring clear direction on the future of adjacent industrial-
designated sites;
• The Mount Pleasant industrial area, a centrally located employment
district with sites within the provincially-mandated TOAs, where

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, July 23, 2025 34
modernized policy guidance is needed to support innovative tech clusters,
light industry, and creative economy uses while carefully considering
residential uses.
8. The City of Vancouver has established ambitious housing goals in the Vancouver
Plan, the Housing Vancouver Strategy, and in response to new provincial
legislation, which collectively aim to accelerate the delivery of diverse, affordable,
and transit-oriented housing options. Achieving these goals necessitates
thoughtful integration of housing objectives with industrial and employment land
protection policies.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to provide site-specific information regarding the future
role, planning considerations, and policy implications for the following exceptional
sites and report back on or before October 31, 2025:
i. The former Molson site;
ii. The former industrial sites near Main Street and Terminal Avenue;
iii. The Railtown industrial district;
iv. The Marine Gateway area; and
v. The Mount Pleasant industrial area.
FURTHER THAT staff continue to process without delay existing and new
applications for the exceptional sites outlined above;
AND FURTHER THAT, following the analysis of site-specific information
regarding the future role, planning considerations, and policy implications of the
exceptional sites listed above, staff prepare concurrent submissions to Metro
Vancouver to remove any recommended sites from the Industrial Land Reserve
in the fall.
B. THAT staff be requested to provide:
• Analysis of how each site supports the goals of the Industrial
Modernization and Intensification Framework, the Vancouver Plan, the
Housing Vancouver Strategy, and the Metro Vancouver Regional
Industrial Lands Strategy;
• Options for future land use directions that maintain or intensify
employment-generating capacity while appropriately accommodating the
potential for housing and public amenities such as green space,
childcare, community and recreation facilities, and arts and culture
spaces;
• Assessment of the sites’ relationship to major transit infrastructure and
opportunities for integrated job space intensification; and
• Any preliminary recommendations for area-specific planning, policy
amendments, or further study;

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, July 23, 2025 35
FURTHER THAT staff include this expanded analysis within the broader context
of their reporting on citywide industrial land supply, pressures on industrial and
employment lands, and protection strategies, and continue to prioritize the
advancement of a modernized, transit-oriented employment lands policy
framework that supports a diverse and sustainable economy.
The Committee adjourned at 9:55 pm.
