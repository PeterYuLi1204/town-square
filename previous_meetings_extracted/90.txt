WHEREAS
1. The Federation of Canadian Municipalities (FCM) represents the interests
of member municipalities on policy and program matters that fall within
federal jurisdiction;

Annual Conference and Trade Show, May 29 – June 1, 2025, followed by the
election of FCM’s Board of Directors;

largest member municipalities by population;
5. In 2024, Council passed a resolution endorsing Councillor Dominato’s
appointment to FCM as one of the three largest municipalities until June 2026.

municipal election, Council will need to submit a new resolution confirming the
appointment to the end of the 2027 Board cycle (or longer). If Councillor
Dominato is not re-elected or Council does not wish to support continuation of
the appointment, the seat becomes vacant, to be filled at a subsequent AGM.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Vancouver City Council endorse Councillor
Lisa Dominato to stand for election on Federation of Canadian Municipalities (FCM)
Board of Directors for the period starting in June 2025 and ending June 2027;
FURTHER THAT all costs associated with Councillor Lisa Dominato attending
