4. Supporting Crisis Centres Supporting Community Needs (Member’s Motion B.4)
At the Council meeting on December 14, 2021 (reconvened from November 16, 2021), due to
time constraints, Council referred the following motion to the Standing Committee on Policy and
Strategic Priorities meeting on January 26, 2022, in order to hear from speakers, followed by
debate and decision.
The Committee heard from one speaker in support of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Fry
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. BC’s Crisis Line Network, a group of community-based non-profit crisis centres
from across our province, 1 support lifesaving crisis de-escalation services,
suicide risk assessment, and collaborative safety planning through specifically
skilled and effective 24/7 crisis service responders: answering calls to 1-800-
SUICIDE, 310-6789 Mental Health, and regional distress lines; providing
employment opportunities and local crisis expertise in Vancouver, Surrey,
Richmond, Nanaimo, Prince George, Kamloops, Kelowna, Trail, Cranbrook, and
Williams Lake; and diverting calls from 911 and police-based mental health
response;
2. To meet rising demand for crisis intervention, the Province announced a well-
intentioned decision to increase funding and centralize call technology for BC’s
Crisis Line Network. As the result of this investment and in accordance with trade
law however, the Province will now be obliged to open all crisis line services to

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, January 26 and 27, 2022 4
competitive bid through a Request for Proposals (RFP). In the case of crisis calls,
this raises the possibility of bids going to large, multinational, for-profit
corporations and privatizing crisis services across the province, adding: privacy
concerns; service quality concerns; impacts on labour and education; and
potentially downloading service to local governments as at-risk callers are
referred to 911 in order to reduce costs and corporate liability;
3. For-profit telemedicine counselling services are a rapidly-growing industry sector.
2, 3 Notably, for-profit private corporations have professional teams to develop
proposals to win contracts. Typically, non-profit crisis centres do not have access
to the same resources to prepare competitive bids, and at a time when their core
services are in greater demand than ever;
4. Crisis Lines are highly integrated in regional health authority mental health
services, providing jobs for over 110 staff members and opportunities for over
550 volunteers. Over 450 students are trained each year as volunteer Crisis Line
Responders in BC, many of whom go on to become doctors, teachers, social
workers, and emergency and mental health professionals in our communities;
5. This year, across BC, Crisis Lines safely de-escalated 99.5% of their calls with
over 2.5 million minutes of life-saving support, saving BC taxpayers
approximately $10.4 million and reducing stresses on police and hospital
services by diverting 7,099 interventions from 911; 16,251 interventions by in-
person Crisis Response Teams; and 50,901 emergency Mental Health Worker
engagements;
6. Vancouver City Council has consistently supported non-policing interventions for
mental health issues where possible:
a. The Vancouver Crisis Centre de-escalated 19,129 mental health crisis and/or
suicide-related calls (including VCH regional and 1800SUICIDE and 310
Mental Health calls) in 2019/20;
b. According to Vancouver Police Department’s 2020 Our Community In Need 4
report, 13,592 of 265,000 police calls for service were mental health related.
The report continues: "2,259 [Calls for Service] may or may not have required
police attendance, which is the equivalent of 6 CFS/ day (VPD officers attend,
on average, 727 CFS a day). These 2,259 CFS resulted in officers dedicating
approximately 11,800 hours, and this equates to 8 officer positions (the cost
of which is, $1,051,935). Of note, there is no current program/community
resource in existence that could have attended in lieu of police";
7. BC’s Special Committee on Reforming the Police Act 5 acknowledges “the role of
police with respect to complex social issues including mental health and
wellness, addictions, and harm reduction; and in consideration of any appropriate
changes to relevant sections of the Mental Health Act.” The August 2020
Statement from the Special Committee further commits to follow-up with other
ministries and independent offices, and seek input from advocacy groups,
subject matter experts, and individuals with frontline experience in several related

Minutes, January 26 and 27, 2022 5
areas including mental health.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT The Mayor on behalf of Council write to Minister of Health, Minister of
Mental Health and Addictions, Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General,
and the Minister of Advanced Education and Skills Training with a letter of
support for funded local Crisis Centres supporting community needs that:
a. Acknowledges role of crisis centres in health and well being of residents;
b. Describes the importance of community-based local services;
c. Highlights the role of crisis centres in diverting 911 calls and police
intervention;
d. Communicates concerns that privatized centralized crisis centres may
result in an increased burden on 911 calls and police, and should be
considered under the scope of the Special Committee on Reforming the
Police Act;
e. Distinguishes that local crisis centres provide important jobs and
volunteer opportunities in the community, including valuable training for
students in the medical, mental health, social work and protective
services fields; and
f. Encourages the province to pursue a funding and support model for BC
crisis centre services that does not prejudice the process towards an
open-bid RFP and recognizes the unique role and importance of BC’s
Crisis Line Network.
B. THAT the following enactment along with preamble clauses 1 and 2 above is
submitted to the LMLGA for endorsement and consideration at the 2022 UBCM
Convention, and a copy of the entire resolution be submitted directly to the
UBCM Health and Social Development Committee for immediate consideration.
Therefore be it resolved that the UBCM urge the Province to pursue a funding
and support model for crisis centre services that does not prejudice the process
towards an open-bid RFP and recognizes the unique role and importance of BC’s
Crisis Line Network, providing local community-based services for vulnerable
British Columbians, diverting 911 calls and police intervention, and encourages
local employment, training, and volunteer opportunities in communities across
BC.

Motion B.6)
At the Council meeting on December 14, 2021 (reconvened from November 16, 2021), due to
time constraints, Council referred the following motion to the Standing Committee on Policy and
Strategic Priorities meeting on January 26, 2022, in order to hear from speakers, followed by
debate and decision.
The Chair called for registered speakers and none were present.
MOVED by Councillor Dominato
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. The City of Vancouver is required by the Vancouver Charter, Library Act, and
Police Act to produce a consolidated operating budget incorporating the separate
internal budgets of the Board of Parks and Recreation, the Vancouver Public
Library Board, and the Vancouver Police Board, and is required by Public Sector
Accounting Standards to include the Vancouver Downtown Parking Corporation
(aka EasyPark) in its consolidated financial statements;
2. The City of Vancouver has a policy (Policy Number ADMIN-004: “Budgets –
Operating”) which outlines the requirements for Operating Revenues and
Expenditures, including authorization requirements. The policy applies to all
Operating Revenues and Operating Expenditures undertaken by the City of
Vancouver and is intended to supplement and provide operational clarity and
promote best practices within the statutory requirements relating to budgeting as
set out in the Vancouver Charter, Police Act, and Library Act;

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, January 26 and 27, 2022 9
3. Section 219 (1) of the Vancouver Charter (“Director of Finance to report on
revenue and expenditure”) states: “As soon as practicable in each year and in
any event by April 30, the Director of Finance must prepare and submit to the
Council a report setting out the Director of Finance’s estimates in detail of the
anticipated revenues and expenditures of the city for that year.”;
4. With respect to the requirement for the City to set an Operating Budget, Policy
Number ADMIN-004 (“Budgets – Operating”) states, under section 2 (1.1), that
“The Director of Finance is to present an Annual Operating Budget for the
upcoming year as a report to Council in December of each year.” The policy
further states that “On an exception basis, as determined by the Director of
Finance, such as may occur in the year of a municipal election, an internal
working budget will be developed by December of that year, and a budget
will be adopted by Council no later than April 30th of the following year as
required by section 219 of the Vancouver Charter.”;
5. Additionally, Policy Number ADMIN-004 (“Budgets – Operating”) states, under
section 2 (1.2), that “In any year in which the budget is not approved by Council
before December 31st, Council may authorize expenditures as are necessary to
carry on the business of the City until the budget is adopted, if the following
conditions are met:
(a) the amounts for that Budget Line Item does not exceed the amount for
the Budget Line Item in the prior Annual Operating Budget, and
(b) the expenditure is approved by at least two-thirds of City Council.”;
6. There are clearly no statutory requirements relating to budgets, as set out in the
Vancouver Charter, Police Act, or Library Act, that would necessitate the
approval of a City of Vancouver Operating Budget in December of any year,
including a municipal election year. An “internal working budget” can be
developed by December of a municipal election year – or “In any year in which
the budget is not approved by Council before December 31st” – and a final
budget adopted by Council no later than April 30th of the following year, with
Council empowered to authorize expenditures necessary to carry on the
business of the City until the budget is adopted if the amounts for that Budget
Line Item does not exceed the amount for the Budget Line Item in the prior year’s
Operating Budget and the expenditure is approved by at least two-thirds of City
Council;
7. As a point of relevant comparison to the City of Vancouver’s budget policy, the
section of the City of Toronto Act (CoTA) 2006 that pertains to Toronto’s “Yearly
Budget” (i.e., section 228) includes an exception clause, namely subsection 228
(2), which states that “Despite subsection (1), a budget for a year immediately
following a year in which a regular election is held may only be adopted in the
year to which the budget applies.” 1
8. Anecdotally, in municipal election years, other Metro Vancouver municipalities
approve their budgets in the year to which the budget applies, allowing the
incoming Council adequate and reasonable time to review the draft budget.

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, January 26 and 27, 2022 10
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Policy Number ADMIN-004 (“Budgets –
Operating”) Section 2 (POLICY STATEMENTS) be amended to empower Council in its
governance and stewardship responsibilities, and to better reflect the budget
circumstances of a municipal election year where there is a new incoming Council by
striking subsection 1.1. under the heading “Requirement to set a budget” and replacing it
with the following amended wording:
• Section 1.1. “The Director of Finance is to present an Annual Operating
Budget for the upcoming year as a report to Council in December of each
year. In the year of a municipal election, an internal working budget will
be developed by December of that year, and a budget will be adopted by
Council in the year that it applies and no later than April 30th of that
year as required by section 219 of the Vancouver Charter.”
____________________
1 Subsection 228 (1) of the City of Toronto Act (CoTA) 2006 states that “For each year, the City shall in the year or

* * * * *
MOVED by Councillor Wiebe
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. Vancouver is struggling to address the impacts of multiple crises. Many residents
feel unsafe and isolated, and are experiencing harm. The current justice system
alone is not able to deal with the complexities of the issues and meet people’s
needs. Systemic change is required, with calls for increased use of restorative
approaches;
2. Restorative justice is a different way to understand and achieve justice. It focuses
on addressing harm, healing and relationships. It’s a relational, inclusive, flexible
and participatory approach that can be complementary or an alternative to the
legal system. It’s guided by values, principles and Indigenous teachings. Affected
parties – those who caused harm, those harmed, their families and community –
are given an opportunity to participate in determining meaningful accountability,
reparation, meeting needs and a path forward;
3. Restorative justice has been proven to be effective in addressing harm, reducing
recidivism, and increasing public safety. For example, Restorative Justice
Victoria is a city-wide program with data from over a decade and almost 1700
cases. They accept diverse and serious cases - robbery, assault, fatalities and
much more. Of all cases accepted into their restorative justice program, 95%
completed successfully. In all cases within the last 4 years, 96% of victims and
99% of offenders were satisfied. 100% of victims would recommend restorative
justice to others;
4. There are about 80 restorative justice programs across BC. Surrounding
municipalities support restorative justice programs, including North & West
Vancouver, Richmond, Surrey, Tri-Cities, Langley and Abbotsford;
5. In Vancouver, there is a huge gap in community-based restorative justice
programs and very limited justice options outside of criminal justice and courts.
An Indigenous program, Vancouver Aboriginal Transformative Justice Services
Society, offers services for Indigenous peoples. MCFD Youth Justice now has
two probation officers who offer restorative justice post-sentencing for youth.
Restorative approaches are available through fee-for-services offered
independently. Criminal justice options expanded to include the Downtown

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, January 26 and 27, 2022 12
Community Court and Drug Treatment Court; they have also expressed interest
in having more restorative justice;
6. A global restorative movement continues to grow. The United Nations endorses
and promotes it. In recent years, leadership has emerged from cities like Hull
(UK), Oakland (USA), and Whanganui (New Zealand) who have expanded the
focus from restorative justice programs to committing to becoming Restorative
Cities;
7. A Restorative City is a city that expands beyond criminal justice to implement
restorative values, principles and practices across multiple sectors. The basic
goals of a Restorative City include healthy people, safe streets, strong
communities, and a connected city that is invested in the humanity of all its
citizens. As Whanganui (NZ) said, it’s creating an environment for all “to thrive
and succeed together through respectful relationships”;
8. The potential benefits and outcomes of a Restorative City are vast. It could
change the trajectories away from ongoing impacts of colonization, polarization,
fragmented services, addiction, poverty, violence, incarceration, death and
environmental destruction; and result in a city deeply rooted in communities that
care for one another;
9. The foundation of becoming a Restorative City has already started in Vancouver
by a diverse collective. Peace of the Circle received initial funding through Civil
Forfeiture Funds, Ministry of Public Safety and Solicitor General BC to launch
‘Building Partnerships for Restorative Justice in Vancouver’. At their latest
stakeholders meeting in October 2021, they reached a consensus to work toward
becoming a Restorative City. Through the coordination of Peace of the Circle,
this collective is collaborating across sectors to create a relational, holistic,
interdisciplinary, decolonizing approach to harm reduction, healing, safety, justice
and peace (see background information for list of participants);
10. Becoming a Restorative City aligns with many current initiatives and strategies of
the City, including: the Healthy City Strategy; the July 2020 motion council
passed: “Decriminalizing Poverty and Supporting Community-led Safety
Initiatives”; Safe Spaces for Women and Girls; Reconciliation and Equity; Anti-
Racism; Murdered and Missing Indigenous Women and Girls; and
11. The Vancouver restorative collective is able to oversee the development and do
the work necessary to move Vancouver towards becoming a Restorative City.
This requires deepening partnerships, support and funding. Achieving justice and
safety lies in the hands of communities, organizations, governments at all levels
and ultimately, all of us.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council endorse the aspiration of Vancouver becoming a Restorative City.
B. THAT Council direct staff to create training opportunities for staff to learn about
restorative justice and that they include opportunities to incorporate restorative

justice values, principles, and programing in future reports back to Council when
applicable.
C. THAT Council commits to having a representative participate in meetings of the
Vancouver restorative collective as a stakeholder;
FURTHER THAT Council direct staff to include an option for $200,000 to support
a restorative justice lens for consideration by Council for the 2022 Budget
process, specific allocation to be for a $150,000 one-time grant to the Restorative
Collective to work on the development of a Restorative City Framework and
$50,000 to support development and delivery of restorative justice training for
City staff and Council.

FINAL MOTION AS APPROVED
WHEREAS

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, January 26 and 27, 2022 14
1. Vancouver is struggling to address the impacts of multiple crises. Many residents
feel unsafe and isolated, and are experiencing harm. The current justice system
alone is not able to deal with the complexities of the issues and meet people’s
needs. Systemic change is required, with calls for increased use of restorative
approaches;
2. Restorative justice is a different way to understand and achieve justice. It focuses
on addressing harm, healing and relationships. It’s a relational, inclusive, flexible
and participatory approach that can be complementary or an alternative to the
legal system. It’s guided by values, principles and Indigenous teachings. Affected
parties – those who caused harm, those harmed, their families and community –
are given an opportunity to participate in determining meaningful accountability,
reparation, meeting needs and a path forward;
3. Restorative justice has been proven to be effective in addressing harm, reducing
recidivism, and increasing public safety. For example, Restorative Justice
Victoria is a city-wide program with data from over a decade and almost 1700
cases. They accept diverse and serious cases - robbery, assault, fatalities and
much more. Of all cases accepted into their restorative justice program, 95%
completed successfully. In all cases within the last 4 years, 96% of victims and
99% of offenders were satisfied. 100% of victims would recommend restorative
justice to others;
4. There are about 80 restorative justice programs across BC. Surrounding
municipalities support restorative justice programs, including North & West
Vancouver, Richmond, Surrey, Tri-Cities, Langley and Abbotsford;
5. In Vancouver, there is a huge gap in community-based restorative justice
programs and very limited justice options outside of criminal justice and courts.
An Indigenous program, Vancouver Aboriginal Transformative Justice Services
Society, offers services for Indigenous peoples. MCFD Youth Justice now has
two probation officers who offer restorative justice post-sentencing for youth.
Restorative approaches are available through fee-for-services offered
independently. Criminal justice options expanded to include the Downtown
Community Court and Drug Treatment Court; they have also expressed interest
in having more restorative justice;
6. A global restorative movement continues to grow. The United Nations endorses
and promotes it. In recent years, leadership has emerged from cities like Hull
(UK), Oakland (USA), and Whanganui (New Zealand) who have expanded the
focus from restorative justice programs to committing to becoming Restorative
Cities;
7. A Restorative City is a city that expands beyond criminal justice to implement
restorative values, principles and practices across multiple sectors. The basic
goals of a Restorative City include healthy people, safe streets, strong
communities, and a connected city that is invested in the humanity of all its
citizens. As Whanganui (NZ) said, it’s creating an environment for all “to thrive
and succeed together through respectful relationships”;

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, January 26 and 27, 2022 15
8. The potential benefits and outcomes of a Restorative City are vast. It could
change the trajectories away from ongoing impacts of colonization, polarization,
fragmented services, addiction, poverty, violence, incarceration, death and
environmental destruction; and result in a city deeply rooted in communities that
care for one another;
9. The foundation of becoming a Restorative City has already started in Vancouver
by a diverse collective. Peace of the Circle received initial funding through Civil
Forfeiture Funds, Ministry of Public Safety and Solicitor General BC to launch
‘Building Partnerships for Restorative Justice in Vancouver’. At their latest
stakeholders meeting in October 2021, they reached a consensus to work toward
becoming a Restorative City. Through the coordination of Peace of the Circle,
this collective is collaborating across sectors to create a relational, holistic,
interdisciplinary, decolonizing approach to harm reduction, healing, safety, justice
and peace (see background information for list of participants);
10. Becoming a Restorative City aligns with many current initiatives and strategies of
the City, including: the Healthy City Strategy; the July 2020 motion council
passed: “Decriminalizing Poverty and Supporting Community-led Safety
Initiatives”; Safe Spaces for Women and Girls; Reconciliation and Equity; Anti-
Racism; Murdered and Missing Indigenous Women and Girls; and
11. The Vancouver restorative collective is able to oversee the development and do
the work necessary to move Vancouver towards becoming a Restorative City.
This requires deepening partnerships, support and funding. Achieving justice and
safety lies in the hands of communities, organizations, governments at all levels
and ultimately, all of us.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council endorse the aspiration of Vancouver becoming a Restorative City,
rooted in community wellness, responsibility and safety.
B. THAT Council direct staff to create training opportunities for staff to learn about
restorative justice and that they include opportunities to incorporate restorative
justice values, principles, and programing in future reports back to Council when
applicable.
C. THAT Council commits to having a representative participate in meetings of the
Vancouver restorative collective as a stakeholder;
FURTHER THAT Council direct staff to allocate up to $200,000 of one-time
funding of the $600,000 budgeted in 2022 for community safety initiatives
emerging out of Council-directed priorities to support the creation of a community
led restorative justice program in Vancouver and to deliver restorative justice
training for City staff.

Restorative Justice Victoria: this city-wide program has data from over a decade and almost
1700 cases and has proven restorative justice is effective. For example, of all cases accepted
into their restorative program, 95% completed successfully. They accept referrals from
individuals/community, police, crown and court and diverse cases - from robbery, assault,
assault with a weapon, intimate partner violence, fatalities and more. In all cases within the last
4 years, 96% of victims and 99% of offenders were satisfied. 100% of victims would recommend
restorative justice to others.

United Nations:
Has long endorsed restorative justice.
“Restorative justice is an inclusive, flexible and participatory approach to crime that can be
complementary or an alternative to the conventional criminal justice process. It provides an
opportunity to all affected parties – offenders, victims, their families and the community – to
participate in addressing the crime and repairing the harm caused by it. It is also often the only,
or one of very few, measures available for victims to participate in the resolution of a case and
seek redress. Underpinning restorative justice is the understanding that criminal behaviour not
only breaches the law, but also harms victims and the community.
In recent decades, the use of restorative justice in criminal matters has significantly increased
around the world. As the custodian of the Basic Principles on the Use of Restorative Justice
Programmes in Criminal Matters, UNODC assists Member States…”:

The 14th UN Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice was held March 7-12, 2021 in
Kyoto, Japan. This largest international meeting in the fields of crime prevention and criminal
justice is organised every five years. The Kyoto Declaration:
● Explicitly calls for the facilitation of “restorative justice processes at relevant stages in
criminal proceedings in order to assist the recovery of victims and the reintegration of
offenders” (article 42).
● Highlights the significance of victim-centred procedures and the key role of
practitioners' professional training “to strengthen their capacity to provide victim-centred
assistance and support that take into account the specific needs of victims” (article 34).

7. Supporting Additional Transportation Options to Reduce Reliance on Vehicle
Ownership (Member’s Motion B.2)
At the Council meeting on January 25, 2022, Council referred the following motion to the
Standing Committee on Policy and Strategic Priorities meeting on January 26, 2022, in order to
hear from speakers, followed by debate and decision.
The Committee heard from three speakers in support of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Dominato
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. Whether it be land use, urban design, housing, or transportation, Vancouver City
Council strives at all times to respond to the needs of the city’s residents and
foster positive change and innovation. Our primary mission is to create a great
city that cares about its people, the environment, and opportunities to live, work,
and prosper;
2. On November 14, 2018, Vancouver City Council initiated a City-Wide Plan
process that will guide the city to 2050 and beyond. Core considerations
propelling the plan include the city’s housing affordability challenges and an
accelerating global climate change crisis;

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, January 26 and 27, 2022 19
3. On November 17, 2020, Council approved a Climate Emergency Action Plan that
builds upon previous climate plans. The focus of the plan is to cut carbon
pollution from the city’s biggest local sources (i.e., vehicles at 39% and buildings
at 54%);
4. The Vancouver Plan process, Planning Vancouver Together, has developed 10
Provisional Goals for the city based upon “a year of listening to Vancouver’s
hopes, fears, joys and struggles”, including a goal to create complete, connected,
walkable, accessible, culturally vibrant neighbourhoods where every resident can
meet their daily needs without relying on private transportation;
5. Notwithstanding the goal to meet the daily needs of residents without relying on
private transportation, in practical terms, not every transportation need of
residents can be met by walking, cycling, or making use of transit;
6. Car-sharing networks provide a cost-effective, transportation option for residents
which spreads the use of a small number of vehicles between many drivers,
thereby saving on the expense of maintaining a private vehicle, as well as
contributing to a more sustainable and livable city by eliminating the need to own
a private vehicle. The car-sharing model offers residents access to a wide array
of vehicles they can rent including electric vehicles;
7. A number of car-sharing organizations operate in Vancouver. These
organizations are encouraged and supported by the City of Vancouver.
Examples include Evo and Modo;1
8. In addition to car-sharing companies and organizations such as Evo and Modo,
peer-to-peer car-sharing has emerged as an option for residents to consider
when the need to access a vehicle arises. Unlike traditional car-sharing,
peer-to-peer car-sharing – for example Turo which launched in Vancouver in
June 2020 – connects private vehicle owners with those seeking to rent a
specific vehicle via an online platform;
9. ICBC has embraced peer-to-peer car-sharing and offers basic blanket insurance
products to companies such as Turo to cover drivers while a vehicle is being
rented. The basic blanket insurance offered by ICBC provides coverage for
accident benefits and $200,000 third party liability;
10. The City’s existing policy and regulatory frameworks may not fully account for
rapidly emerging car-sharing innovations and trends such as peer-to-peer
car-sharing. Policy and regulatory opportunities might include:
• Listing city owned vehicles on peer-to-peer car sharing platforms and
allowing City employees to use peer-to-peer cars for business related travel;
• Updating the Street and Traffic By-law No. 2849 to enable peer-to-peer
car-share parking in “resident only” and “no parking except with permit” areas
(currently applies to car-share);
• Creating opportunities for low-carbon vehicles to park in the city (T2040 M
5.2.3) – enable parking for peer-to-peer car-sharing EVs;

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, January 26 and 27, 2022 20
• Supporting access for peer-to-peer car-sharing at VYR, Pacific Central, and
at mobility and transit centers;
• Adding Turo and other peer-to-peer car-sharing platforms to the City’s
website; and
• Partnering on charging stations throughout the city for EVs (T2040M 5.1.3.) –
affordable access to charging for peer-to-peer car-sharing EVs.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to engage with peer-to-peer
car-sharing companies and organizations, such as but not limited to Turo, and explore
opportunities for encouraging peer-to-peer car-sharing through adaptation of the City’s
regulatory framework;
FURTHER THAT staff report back with their findings and recommendations in Q2 2022.
amended
____________________
1 As of September 12, 2019, Evo Car Share has an agreement in place with the City to allow its
members to end their one-way car-sharing trips in metered parking spaces. As part of this
agreement, Evo is covering the full cost of using the metered parking.

THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, January 26 and 27, 2022 21
1. Vancouver is one of the greatest cities in the world in which to live;
2. Vancouver is also one of the most unaffordable cities in the world in which to live
with many residents struggling to rent or purchase homes and adequate
accommodation being especially difficult for households with an annual income
under $80,000;
3. Vancouver suffers from a “missing middle” of housing choices with the Downtown
core featuring a highly densified urban landscape but the vast majority of the
remaining residential land reserved for legacy housing forms such as single
detached homes or duplexes usually too expensive for all but the wealthiest to
rent or buy;
4. Vancouver has declared a climate emergency, which requires constructing
critical infrastructure and more walkable neighbourhoods to reduce greenhouse
gas emissions.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to develop appropriate
policies and/or guidelines for Council’s consideration in 2022, targeting up to 2000 lots
currently zoned for single-detached home or duplexes to be developed for up to six
units, subject to appropriate rezonings, and that the new policy:
i. Consider modest height increases to ensure compatibility with neighbouring
buildings;
ii. Consider lower floor units to be located appropriately below grade;
iii. Consider development cost expectations where appropriate to limit potential
speculative land purchases;
iv. Consider development cost levies where appropriate to contribute to
neighbourhood infrastructure such as water, sewers, active transportation, roads,
sidewalks, parks, child care, and housing affordable for households with annual
incomes less than $80,000 either on location or elsewhere in the city;
v. Consider development contributions where appropriate, including community
amenity contributions, that can help advance the Climate Emergency Action
Plan, community facilities, or other public benefits, payable as determined by
Council in its unfettered discretion when considering any rezoning; and
vi. Consider how the Tenant Relocation and Protection Policy can be applied to
tenancies in properties considered for redevelopment under this policy;
FURTHER THAT Council also direct staff to develop appropriate policies and/or
guidelines for Council’s later consideration to reduce floor space ratio for
single-detached homes as a densification incentive;
FURTHER THAT the areas approved under the Secured Rental Policy are excluded
from this program;
AND FURTHER THAT this work aligns with, and be incorporated into the Vancouver
Plan.

THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. The City of Vancouver is committed to helping citizens enjoy a good quality of life
by regulating and enforcing property use, noise, and graffiti issues. The City
works to manage noise through land-use planning, by-laws and traffic
management;
2. Noise is part of urban life, but too much noise is disruptive and harmful to
well-being. The City’s Noise Control By-law defines how much noise is
acceptable, based on:
• Where you are
• Where the noise is coming from
• What is making the noise
• What time and day the noise is occurring
3. The City’s Noise Control By-law aims to balance noise from most activities in a
way that respects everyone's right to relative comfort, within reason. The by-law
specifically regulates noise from:

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, January 26 and 27, 2022 28
• Carpet-cleaning equipment with in vehicles
• Lawn mowers and weed eaters
• TVs, radios, stereos, amplifiers, and musical instruments
• Parties and gatherings
• People shouting
• Pressure washers
4. Historically, in 1997, growing concerns about noise and its effects on everyday
life in Vancouver led to the creation of the Urban Noise Task Force. This citizens
group, with the assistance of City staff and Councillors, made a series of
recommendations for improving Vancouver’s “soundscape” many of which have
been, or are being implemented;
5. The Report of the Urban Noise Task Force from April 1997 noted that “Lawn
mowers, leaf blowers, trimmers, edgers, mulchers, and other lawn and garden
equipment are a significant source of noise for many people” and that
“Twentyfive percent of the letters received by the Task Force commented about
the noise produced by these machines.” The report also noted that “Noise from
motorized lawn/garden equipment was the most frequently mentioned noise
problem” and thus the Task Force strongly suggested that the City move toward
the use of non-motorized gardening services and methods in its own operations;
6. Recommendation 40.1 from the 1997 Urban Noise Task Force report states that
“The City should, based on technological advances within the industry, require
that all leaf blowers maintain a maximum decibel level of 70 at 50 feet until
January 1998, when 65 decibels will be the maximum allowable; that they be run
at the lowest effective throttle setting and that between October 1 and April 30 of
each year the City establish hours of use….”;
7. The City’s website currently states that “Leaf blowers can be operated in
Vancouver, but not in the West End” (i.e., an area bounded by Stanley Park,
Burrard Street, West Georgia Street, and Beach Avenue. The City of Vancouver
defines a leaf blower as a “backpack-mounted or handheld machine used for
blowing or sucking up leaves, grass, or debris.” Leaf blowers may have vacuum
attachments. Vehicle-mounted leaf blowers are not included in the City’s
definition;
8. The City’s website states that “A manufacturer’s decal must be attached to the
leaf blower” to certify that it meets the "Category 1 – dB (A) ≤ 65" equipment
standard set out in ANSI B175.2 – 200, published by the Portable Power
Equipment Manufacturer’s Association. The decal includes the following text: [
The manufacturer's model number ] and Maximum sound level 65 dB(A) and
Measured at 50 ft (15 m) Per ANSI B175.2 – 200;
9. Vancouver has declared a Climate Emergency and developed a plan that aims to
reduce carbon pollution by 50% by 2030;
10. In January 2019, the Vancouver Park Board unanimously carried a motion
(“Renewal Strategy for Landscape Equipment – Towards an Emission-Free
Reality”) which directed Park Board staff to work with unions and WorkSafeBC

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, January 26 and 27, 2022 29
“to develop a transition plan to replace and retrofit gas-powered landscape
maintenance equipment used for park maintenance with emission-free
equivalents or quasi-equivalents where possible.” The motion also directed that
“the transition plan include financial considerations, including purchase, usage,
maintenance and end-of-life replacement costs, as well as ways to
quantify/qualify non-financial benefits such as: carbon emission reduction;
disposal of refuse oil and other parts;
11. A recent December 7, 2020, Memo from the Park Board General Manager
served to report back on the work being undertaken by Park Board staff in
response to motion approved by the Board in January 2019. It states that staff
anticipate transitioning all small landscaping equipment to zero emission
alternatives over the next four years. The Memo also notes several key findings
from the 2019 pilot, as well as the fact the Park Board has been transitioning its
gas-powered equipment to low or no-emission equipment for many years as
equipment reaches end of life, and that electric options meeting performance and
function specifications are preferred for all equipment procurement in accordance
with Vancouver’s commitment to reducing its environmental emissions and fossil
fuel consumption;
12. Feedback received from the public by members of Council frequently cites the
issue of noise and emissions from gasoline-powered landscape maintenance
equipment, such as lawn mowers, trimmers, chain saws, and especially leaf
blowers. Members of the public often suggest that the use of gasoline-powered
equipment be prohibited in favour of non-emitting electric alternatives which are
also considered to be far quieter;
13. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the negative noise impacts from
gasoline-powered landscape maintenance equipment have been significantly
heightened for residents with so many people working from home and spending
considerably more time at home. Increasingly, Council and the City are receiving
noise complaints that point to the need to revisit noise reduction strategies with
respect to gas-powered landscape maintenance equipment and transition
towards replacement and/or retrofitting gas-powered landscape maintenance
equipment with quieter, emission-free equivalents or quasi-equivalents.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Vancouver City Council direct staff to report back with recommendations to
meet the goal to phase out and transition personal and commercial use of
gasoline-powered landscape maintenance equipment in the City of Vancouver by
2024, giving consideration to a timeframe that is workable for residents and
landscape maintenance service providers alike.
B. THAT recommendations are informed by consultation with relevant stakeholders
such as but not limited to representative strata councils and the BC Landscape
and Nursery Association.
C. THAT phase out recommendations be sensitive to any increased costs that
transitioning would create for residents and the landscape maintenance industry,

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, January 26 and 27, 2022 30
and that a reasonable transition timeframe be considered before any potential
by-law changes would be implemented.
D. THAT the report back identify (but not be limited to):
• any issues with respect to implementing a ban on gasoline-powered
landscape maintenance equipment;
• all relevant City by-laws and policies that currently impact upon noise and
emissions from gasoline-powered landscape maintenance equipment that
would require amendment;
• information related to the impact that gasoline-powered landscape
maintenance equipment can have on noise and local/regional air pollution
as well as implications for mental well-being, quality of life and human
health;
• information regarding harmful environmental effects of gasoline-powered
landscape maintenance equipment;
• information on availability and trends that would allow non-emitting electric
landscaping equipment to equal and/or exceed the performance of gasoline-
powered equipment.

THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. E-Comm (Emergency Communications for British Columbia Incorporated) is a
non-profit corporation governed under the Emergency Communications
Corporations Act. It was established in 1999 and is owned and governed by
various municipal, regional, and provincial emergency services including the City
of Vancouver;
2. The City of Vancouver is currently represented on the E-Comm Board of
Directors by City Manager Paul Mochrie. The Vancouver Police Board is
represented on the E-Comm Board of Directors by former Vancouver Police
Department Deputy Chief Warren Lemcke;
3. E-Comm owns and maintains the emergency radio system used by police, fire,
and ambulance services within Metro Vancouver and parts of the Fraser Valley;
4. E-Comm is the first point of contact for 99 percent of callers who dial 9-1-1 in
B.C. and it provides call-taking and dispatch services for 33 police agencies and
40 fire departments across the province. E-Comm has approximately 422

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, January 26 and 27, 2022 35
full-time and 94 part-time employees (based on a 12-month average), many of
whom are represented by CUPE Local 8911;
5. E-Comm provides an essential public service to millions of British Columbians,
but ongoing challenges have reportedly put this vital service at risk of
catastrophic failure for the public who rely upon it. CUPE 8911 cites various
challenges to the system, including understaffing in a high-stress environment
that has led to severe burnout, poor working conditions, high staff turnover, and
ongoing challenges with recruitment and the training of new staff;
6. CUPE 8911 points to “a reactive funding formula, based on cost recovery” in an
issue backgrounder as the main impediment to meaningfully improving the
services it provides and “getting ahead of existing problems” (see: E-COMM
9-1-1: Fixing A Broken Service – A Guide For B.C. Municipalities – by The
Emergency Communications Professionals of BC (CUPE LOCAL 8911)
https://www.ecpbc.ca/wp-
content/uploads/2021/10/CUPE8911_Backgrounder_FNL.pdf);
7. The CRTC has mandated modernization to move from 9-1-1 voice calls to digital
or IP-based infrastructure, which is to be completed by March 1, 2022;
8. E-Comm is preparing for the transition from 9-1-1 voice calls to digital or
IP-based infrastructure in accordance with direction from the CRTC and has
communicated the need for a significant additional funding commitment from
each 9-1-1 service partner in 2022 and beyond. Digital or IP-based 9-1-1
services will reportedly revolutionize the 9-1-1 service and will ultimately enable
9-1-1 operators to respond to video, photo, and text calls for service through
9-1-1;
9. As the media have widely reported, during a crisis such as extreme weather
events seen during this past summer’s heatwave, E-Comm is simply unable to
handle call volumes. A recent report from Price Waterhouse Cooper –
commissioned by E-Comm – concluded that the company cannot be successful
with an understaffed system that relies so heavily “on overtime and staff missing
breaks” or that simply abandons efforts to meet its service levels;1
10. Reports of inadequate staffing levels amid the high-stress working environment
at E-Comm which have reportedly led to severe burnout, poor working
conditions, high staff turnover, and ongoing challenges with recruitment and
training of new staff, point to the need for better health and mental health
supports for E-Comm staff and a commensurate level of funding, to ensure the
stability and effectiveness of our emergency response systems and the vitally
important role of E-Comm staff in our emergency response system;
11. In 2021, the President and CEO of E-Comm, Oliver Grüter-Andrew, made two
presentations to the provincial legislature’s Special Committee on Reforming the
Police Act (October 15, 2021 and February 26, 2021) in which the CEHO

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, January 26 and 27, 2022 36
elaborated on many of the challenges faced by E-Comm and its staff – these
were generally consistent with the challenges cited by CUPE 8911;
12. The need for operational change and infrastructure investment in E-Comm to
ensure the stable delivery of appropriate levels of day-to-day and emergency
level services expected by the public and Vancouver residents, is readily
apparent and inherently in the public interest and the interest of public safety.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to report back with an assessment and report by the
end of April, 2022 on the E-Comm situation (as outlined and identified by CUPE
Local 8911 and other stakeholders), with information and options the City of
Vancouver could support, advocate for and/or endorse, in order to enable the
stable delivery of Emergency Services for the public and to address the range of
identified issues faced by E-Comm such as but not limited to an equitable and
evolved E-Comm funding model, the mandated CRTC modernization
requirements, E-Comm governance and operational models, and various
E-Comm capital investment needs.
B. FURTHER THAT Council request the Mayor on behalf of Council to write to the
relevant Federal and Provincial Ministers (such as BC’s Ministers of Health and
Public Safety and the Federal Ministers responsible for the CRTC and Public
Safety) to advocate for capital funding to support and assist with the technology
modernization and transformation mandated by the CRTC, to move away from
9-1-1 voice calls in favour of digital or IP-based infrastructure, in order to help
close an identified E-Comm capital funding gap and to ensure the improvement
of crucial emergency services for the public.
C. THAT copies of this motion, together with the letters requested in resolution B
above, be sent to the Union of BC Municipalities and the Lower Mainland Local
Government Association for their information and consideration.

MOVED by Councillor Boyle
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. According to the 2016 Canadian census, there are more than 95,570 persons
aged 65 and older living in Vancouver, accounting for approximately 15.1% of the
city’s total population. Moreover, the population of adults over the age of 65 in the
province of British Columbia is expected to rise approximately 63% by the year
2041;
2. Older persons living on their own are at increased risk of experiencing
homelessness. A large proportion of older persons in Vancouver are living on
their own. Currently, 21% of all households in Vancouver are senior-led and it is
estimated that over the course of the next decade, 23-25% of households in the
city will be led by persons over the age of 65. According to data from the 2016
census, approximately 16.6% of all senior-led renter households were spending
50% or more of their income on their housing costs, making them housing
insecure and placing them at increased risk of eviction. The majority of these
individuals are single women. Moreover, the social housing waitlist for older
adults has increased by 54% between 2014 to 2019 and individuals over the age
of 65 represent 37% of the region’s waitlist;
3. Older persons can face unique barriers to civic participation such as health
limitations, mobility challenges, and cognitive decline. In fact, 52,700 individuals
65 and older (55%) in Vancouver reported that they have specific health and
activity limitations, including 20,660 older persons who reported permanent
challenges and 24,045 older adults who sometimes experience challenges.
These barriers put older persons at increased risk of experiencing social
isolation, loneliness, and economic vulnerability;
4. Recent health and climate emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and
the heat dome, have disproportionately impacted older persons. The BC Seniors
Advocate indicated that residents of long-term care and assisted living homes
were 33 times more likely to die from COVID. 99 people in Vancouver died
during the heat dome, many of then older adults. Vancouver Fire Fighters
reported waiting 11 hours for a BC Ambulance for an elderly person. These
crises have highlighted the seriousness and urgency of addressing existing gaps
in policies, systems, housing, community services and programs to prevent
further devastating impacts on many people living in the city, including on older
persons;
5. The World Health Organization has declared 2021-2030 as the Decade of
Healthy Ageing and has incorporated additional met48rics under the Healthy
Cities strategy toward improving quality of life specifically for older persons
(mitigation of poverty, food security, expand opportunities for civic engagement,
opportunities for lifelong learning, age and gender equality, job opportunities,
internet access and digital support, housing, etc.);

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, January 26 and 27, 2022 38
6. The City of Vancouver has a long history of working toward age-friendly
improvements in municipal planning. In 2013, the City of Vancouver initiated the
Age-friendly Action Plan (2013-2015) and identified a series of over 60 actions
that the City can take to help make Vancouver a more safe, inclusive, and
engaging city for seniors. In the following year, Vancouver joined the World
Health Organization (WHO) Healthy Cities initiative 2014 to 2025. Under this
initiative, the City of Vancouver completed two reports: Phase 1 A Healthy City
for All: Vancouver’s Healthy City Strategy (2014) and Phase 2 Healthy City
Strategy – Four Year Action Plan (2015-2018);
7. To extend work on the Age Friendly Action Plan, the City of Vancouver Planning
department held a workshop entitled: Age-Friendly Action Research Lab Co-
initiating Workshop at Creekside Community Centre on September 24, 2018
engaging members of the Older Persons and Elders community. This work then
led to the two additional workshops on March 8 and April 15, 2019 engaging
more members of the Seniors’ community;
8. The Older Persons and Elders community was very excited by their engagement
in 2018 and 2019 workshops which was to lead to the creation of Strategy for
Older Persons and Elders. This work was interrupted during COVID-19;
9. Municipalities such as Richmond, Surrey, Calgary, Toronto, Ottawa, and
Montreal have adopted dedicated planning capacity within municipal resources to
support the needs of older persons. Their efforts have resulted in comprehensive
planning and formal partnerships and MOUs across different levels of
government, multi-agencies, and community organizations specifically focused
on supporting Healthy Ageing;
10. Gaps and challenges remain in municipal planning for older persons and elders
in the City of Vancouver. On September 28, 2021, City Council convened 2050:
An Expert Discussion on Planning and Growth where each consultant noted that
the Vancouver Plan was devoid of any strategies to address the impacts of the
demographic shift in population. Particular emphasis was placed on the need to
expand housing options in all neighbourhoods and community programs and
services to best meet the evolving needs of our aging population;
11. The City of Vancouver’s social policy team is working hard on a number of
important Council directed initiatives, including Poverty Reduction, Access
Without Fear for residents with precarious immigration status, Sex Worker Safety
initiatives, social policy grants, and more. This team is spread thin. Without a
dedicated planner for Older Persons and Elders, the City of Vancouver’s has
struggled to keep up with best practices in social policy development to address
the needs of seniors, and to ensure that our growing population of older persons
and Elders can engage and participate fully in civic and community life; and
12. The Seniors Advisory Committee has asked its two Councillor Liaisons to put

isolation.”
CARRIED UNANIMOUSLY (Vote No. 08054)
(Councillors De Genova, Dominato and Hardwick absent for the vote)
The amendment having carried, the motion as amended was put and CARRIED
UNANIMOUSLY (Vote No. 08055), with Councillors De Genova, Dominato and Hardwick
absent for the vote.
FINAL MOTION AS APPROVED
WHEREAS
1. According to the 2016 Canadian census, there are more than 95,570 persons
aged 65 and older living in Vancouver, accounting for approximately 15.1% of the
city’s total population. Moreover, the population of adults over the age of 65 in the
province of British Columbia is expected to rise approximately 63% by the year
2041;
2. Older persons living on their own are at increased risk of experiencing
homelessness. A large proportion of older persons in Vancouver are living on
their own. Currently, 21% of all households in Vancouver are senior-led and it is

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, January 26 and 27, 2022 41
estimated that over the course of the next decade, 23-25% of households in the
city will be led by persons over the age of 65. According to data from the 2016
census, approximately 16.6% of all senior-led renter households were spending
50% or more of their income on their housing costs, making them housing
insecure and placing them at increased risk of eviction. The majority of these
individuals are single women. Moreover, the social housing waitlist for older
adults has increased by 54% between 2014 to 2019 and individuals over the age
of 65 represent 37% of the region’s waitlist;
3. Older persons can face unique barriers to civic participation such as health
limitations, mobility challenges, and cognitive decline. In fact, 52,700 individuals
65 and older (55%) in Vancouver reported that they have specific health and
activity limitations, including 20,660 older persons who reported permanent
challenges and 24,045 older adults who sometimes experience challenges.
These barriers put older persons at increased risk of experiencing social
isolation, loneliness, and economic vulnerability;
4. Recent health and climate emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and
the heat dome, have disproportionately impacted older persons. The BC Seniors
Advocate indicated that residents of long-term care and assisted living homes
were 33 times more likely to die from COVID. 99 people in Vancouver died
during the heat dome, many of then older adults. Vancouver Fire Fighters
reported waiting 11 hours for a BC Ambulance for an elderly person. These
crises have highlighted the seriousness and urgency of addressing existing gaps
in policies, systems, housing, community services and programs to prevent
further devastating impacts on many people living in the city, including on older
persons;
5. The World Health Organization has declared 2021-2030 as the Decade of
Healthy Ageing and has incorporated additional met48rics under the Healthy
Cities strategy toward improving quality of life specifically for older persons
(mitigation of poverty, food security, expand opportunities for civic engagement,
opportunities for lifelong learning, age and gender equality, job opportunities,
internet access and digital support, housing, etc.);
6. The City of Vancouver has a long history of working toward age-friendly
improvements in municipal planning. In 2013, the City of Vancouver initiated the
Age-friendly Action Plan (2013-2015) and identified a series of over 60 actions
that the City can take to help make Vancouver a more safe, inclusive, and
engaging city for seniors. In the following year, Vancouver joined the World
Health Organization (WHO) Healthy Cities initiative 2014 to 2025. Under this
initiative, the City of Vancouver completed two reports: Phase 1 A Healthy City
for All: Vancouver’s Healthy City Strategy (2014) and Phase 2 Healthy City
Strategy – Four Year Action Plan (2015-2018);
7. To extend work on the Age Friendly Action Plan, the City of Vancouver Planning
department held a workshop entitled: Age-Friendly Action Research Lab Co-
initiating Workshop at Creekside Community Centre on September 24, 2018
engaging members of the Older Persons and Elders community. This work then

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, January 26 and 27, 2022 42
led to the two additional workshops on March 8 and April 15, 2019 engaging
more members of the Seniors’ community;
8. The Older Persons and Elders community was very excited by their engagement
in 2018 and 2019 workshops which was to lead to the creation of Strategy for
Older Persons and Elders. This work was interrupted during COVID-19;
9. Municipalities such as Richmond, Surrey, Calgary, Toronto, Ottawa, and
Montreal have adopted dedicated planning capacity within municipal resources to
support the needs of older persons. Their efforts have resulted in comprehensive
planning and formal partnerships and MOUs across different levels of
government, multi-agencies, and community organizations specifically focused
on supporting Healthy Ageing;
10. Gaps and challenges remain in municipal planning for older persons and elders
in the City of Vancouver. On September 28, 2021, City Council convened 2050:
An Expert Discussion on Planning and Growth where each consultant noted that
the Vancouver Plan was devoid of any strategies to address the impacts of the
demographic shift in population. Particular emphasis was placed on the need to
expand housing options in all neighbourhoods and community programs and
services to best meet the evolving needs of our aging population;
11. The City of Vancouver’s social policy team is working hard on a number of
important Council directed initiatives, including Poverty Reduction, Access
Without Fear for residents with precarious immigration status, Sex Worker Safety
initiatives, social policy grants, and more. This team is spread thin. Without a
dedicated planner for Older Persons and Elders, the City of Vancouver’s has
struggled to keep up with best practices in social policy development to address
the needs of seniors, and to ensure that our growing population of older persons
and Elders can engage and participate fully in civic and community life; and
12. The Seniors Advisory Committee has asked its two Councillor Liaisons to put
forward this motion to City Council.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to explore and report back as soon as possible, without
detracting from work on other equity items currently being undertaken (some of
which may also benefit older persons and elders), on a plan to advance efforts to
