4. Interim Funding for School Meal Program
On February 13, 2019, Vancouver City Council, at its meeting immediately following the
Standing Committee on City Finance and Services, referred debate and decision on the
following motion to the Regular Council meeting to be held on February 26, 2019, as Unfinished
Business.
MOVED by Councillor Fry
SECONDED by Councillor De Genova
WHEREAS
1. Vancouver’s Healthy City Strategy is comprised of thirteen long-term goals and
an integrated plan for healthier people, healthier places, and a healthier planet;
2. The Healthy City Strategy includes goals both that Vancouver's children have the
best chance of enjoying a healthy childhood, and a healthy, just, and sustainable
food system;
3. Nutritionally-balanced school meal programs are widely considered to have a
positive effect on school performance, as well as cognitive and social-emotional
skill development;
4. Since 2014, the City of Vancouver though Arts Culture and Community Services
has been providing $320,000 per year to the Vancouver School Board and
$80,000 per year to the Strathcona Community Centre Association for school
food programs;
5. Over the past three years, costs of the Vancouver School Board meal provision
supported by the City of Vancouver have increased which has led to a reduction
in students served from 258 per day to 200 per day;
6. Other nutritious meal programs are delivered more cost-effectively
(e.g. Strathcona Community Centre $3.54, Carnegie Community Centre $4.36 to
$6.20);
7. City staff have encouraged the Vancouver School Board to deliver nutritious
meals at a lower cost per meal, enabling more students to be fed;
8. In 2017, the Vancouver School Board commissioned a food services review to
inform a three-year Food Services Plan which is expected to be shared with the
City in April 2019;

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, February 26, 2019 18
9. As part of the 2019 budget process, staff put forward a reduction of $160,000 to
the grant to balance the operating budget and because of the increasing costs of
the Vancouver School Board meal program where increasing cost per meal was
impacting the reach of the program. Staff also identified that while City resources
make a contribution, school meal provision is a Provincial mandate;
10. The City maintained $80,000 in the 2019 Operating Budget for the Strathcona
Community Centre Association meal program because nutritious meals are
delivered at a reasonable cost, enabling the City to support more children with its
grant;
11. That Vancouver School Board (VSB) staff are intending to review the imminent
VSB 3-year Food Services Plan and advise City staff as to whether concerns
about cost per meal can be addressed to ensure maximum reach for the City’s
investment;
12. Without immediate alternate funding, efficiencies in food services provision, or
internal reprioritization of Vancouver School Board (VSB) resources by the VSB,
there are concerns that the currently served vulnerable children may experience
school-day hunger that reinforces stigma and impacts children’s ability to learn,
and general health outcomes;
13. That under the existing operating model, the funding gap to maintain the existing
meal program until the end of the 2018/2019 school year is $32,000 should the
Vancouver School Board choose to apply the current $160,000 grant to the
remainder of the 2018/2019 school year.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council approve a one-time $32,000 grant to the Vancouver School Board
Meal Program to enable them to complete the 2018/2019 school year with the
current model, source of funds to be reprioritization within the 2019 Operating
Budget.
B. THAT City staff be directed to report back no later than mid-July 2019 with
recommendation for City support of the Vancouver School Board (VSB) meal
program for the 2019/2020 school year, provided the VSB presents a meal
program with a cost per meal that is in-line with the range of costs of other
nutritious meal programs.
C. THAT if the Vancouver School Board is unable to present a meal program with a
cost per meal that is more in-line with other nutritious meal programs, City staff
be directed to engage in discussions with other community partners to explore
other models for more affordable delivery of nutritious meals to students.
D. THAT Council direct the Mayor to liaise with the Vancouver School Board (VSB)
Chair, encouraging them to consider internal reprioritization within the VSB
budget to increase support this program.

5. Changing Vancouver’s Housing By-laws, Policies and Budgets to Achieve Real
Housing Affordability
On February 13, 2019, Vancouver City Council, at its meeting immediately following the
Standing Committee on City Finance and Services, referred debate and decision on the
following motion to the Regular Council meeting to be held on February 26, 2019, as Unfinished
Business.
MOVED by Councillor Carr
SECONDED by Councillor Wiebe
WHEREAS
1. The lack of rental housing available at rents affordable for low to average income
earners in Vancouver is a primary cause of Vancouver’s housing affordability and
homelessness crisis;
2. Over 50 percent of Vancouver residents are renters, with 44 percent (more than
50,000 renter households) paying more than 30 percent of their income on rent
and utilities and 25 percent paying more than 50 percent of their income on rent
and utilities (source: Vancouver Courier May 8, 2018);
3. The standard definition of affordable housing used by the Canada Mortgage and
Housing Corporation (CMHC) and BC Housing states that a household should
pay no more than 30 percent of their gross income on rent;
4. The City of Vancouver offers incentives to build rental housing including the
waiving of Development Cost Levies if proposed rents are at or below rents
specified in the city’s Rental Incentive Guidelines, currently ranging from $1,496
for a studio to $3,365 for a 3-bedroom unit on the East side and $1,646 for a
studio to $3,702 for a 3-bedroom unit on the West side, the lowest of which
would require a household income of $59,840 to be affordable;
5. Vancouver’s 2018 Housing Data Book reveals that 12 percent of Vancouver
renter households earn less than $15,000 per year; 18 percent earn between
$15,000 and $30,000 per year, and 20 percent earn between $30,000 and
$50,000 per year. Given that 50 percent of Vancouver renter households earn
less than $50,000 per year, affordable rents for half of Vancouver’s renter
households should be, at the most, $1,250 per month or less;
6. Vancouver has been primarily incentivizing and subsidizing rental housing only
affordable for households at higher incomes. From 2006 to 2016, as a portion of
all renter households, households earning below $25,000 per year have dropped
from 38 to 27 percent and renter households earning over $100,000 per year
rose from 7 to 19 percent (City of Vancouver 2018 Housing Data Book);
7. The Vancouver Housing and Homelessness Strategy Reset passed by Council
on March 29, 2017 states that the City will change business practices and
connect new and existing housing supply to local residents’ incomes, family size
and location, and the Housing Vancouver Strategy of November 28, 2017
focuses city efforts on the “right supply” of housing, but only states that new
housing must be in line with the broad range of local incomes in Vancouver.

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, February 26, 2019 26
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to:
i. Review all existing Vancouver housing programs to identify ways to meet
Vancouver residents’ needs for affordable housing at rates in line with the
Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) and BC Housing
definitions of housing affordability (a household paying no more than
30 percent of gross household income on rent);
ii. Report back in 2019, through the upcoming review of rental incentive
programs (e.g. Rental 100), the development of a new incentive program
for Community-based Housing, and the development of the governance
model and implementation strategy for the Vancouver Affordable Housing
Endowment Fund, onspecific changes to our housing program goals and
targets as well as changes to by-laws, policies and incentive programs
that will incentivize an d enable delivering the ‘right’ supply of housing to
truly match residents’ needs for affordable housing based on CMHC’s
definition of housing affordability and explore the possibility that rent
increases in any new program(s) will be capped at the Residential
Tenancy Branch annual increase regardless of unit turnover;
iii. Propose for Council’s consideration and incorporation into Vancouver’s
2020 capital and operating budgets the funds needed to move forward on
the housing program changes needed to achieve the delivery of the ‘right’
supply of housing to truly match residents’ needs for affordable housing
based on CMHC’s definition of housing affordability.

levels of funding, and outlining avenues for changing terminology that Council
does have the jurisdiction to change. This should include considerations for
updating the term ‘for profit affordable housing’ and creating improved clarity

that housing is at HILs rates and the remainder is market rental. Also, that
updates on possible changes to terminology be reported back on as part of

7 km Broadway Subway Project extension to UBC: A Rail Rapid Transit
(RRT/SkyTrain) from Arbutus to UBC;
2. A condition of Vancouver City Council’s approval of the subway extension to
UBC was equitable transit oriented development that encourages creation of
housing options near transit with priority given to affordability;
3. The City has undertaken a number of policies, directives and by-laws, including:
a. In a measure to limit displacement, On April 17, 2007, Vancouver City
Council unanimously approved the Protection of Rental Housing Stock:
Rate of Change Regulations (April 5, 2007, VanRIMS No. 11-2200-21),
which mandates a one for one replacement of rental housing;
b. In a measure to limit speculation, On June 20, 2018, Vancouver City
Council approved the Broadway Planning Program: a two year planning
process to consider the surrounding land use for the 6 km route
Millennium Line Broadway Extension, from Clark Drive to Vine Street;
c. In a measure to encourage the development of rental housing, On
July 3, 2018, the Province of British Columbia passed the Residential
Rental Tenure Zoning Amendment Act: legislation that provides local
governments with a new authority to zone for residential rental tenure
(i.e. rental housing) in areas where multi-family residential use is
permitted; and enact zoning bylaws that require that new housing in
residential areas be developed as rental units; and ensure that existing
areas of rental housing are preserved as such;

behalf of the public a percentage of the land value wealth being created
by City of Vancouver decision making, and report back in July 2019;
4. Vancouver currently has an extremely low vacancy rate of 0.8% and planning
staff have identified that there are approximately 30,000 older affordable rental
units along the Broadway corridor from Clark to Vine, and even more from Vine
to UBC;
5. Transit Oriented Development leads the speculative real estate market in most
major North American metropolitan areas, especially and including Vancouver;
6. City staff have previously advised that “Land speculation can contribute to rising
land costs, impact housing and job space affordability, and hurt the City’s ability
to deliver affordable rental housing and provide community amenities to serve
the needs of our growing population.”;
7. The potential for land speculation in the Arbutus to UBC Subway Extension
planning area poses a dangerous risk to the housing security of tens of
thousands of renting Vancouverites, requiring an emergency interim zoning
policy.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to identify an Arbutus to UBC Subway Extension
planning area, along the new proposed potential route and surrounding proximity
of at least or close to 800 meters on either side to the north and south, except for
the MST-owned land area as identified in the concurrent Jericho Lands Policy
Planning Program.
B. THAT Council direct staff to explore the use of rental only zoning in the
Broadway Plan area and in the Arbutus to UBC Subway Extension planning area
through the Broadway Planning Process, the City-wide plan process or other
robust, collaborative and equitable planning processes to enhance the protection
of renters and limit speculation in response to transit infrastructure investment.
C. THAT Council direct staff to extend the Broadway Plan interim rezoning policy
(Policy on Consideration of Rezoning Applications and Heritage Revitalization

rezoning policy may be considered under exceptional circumstances once
reported to Council for, at the discretion of the Director of Planning.

5. Future of the 420 Cannabis Protest
MOVED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
SECONDED by Councillor De Genova
WHEREAS
1. In February 2016, the Chair of the Vancouver Park Board wrote to the Mayor
expressing concern on behalf of the Board of Commissioners about the
unsanctioned 420 event moving to Sunset Beach, and the fact that City of
Vancouver staff had confirmed this location to organizers without consultation
with the elected Board;
2. In March 2017, Vancouver City Council referred a motion to staff titled ‘Finding
an Appropriate Location for Vancouver’s 2017 420 Event’ on the stated basis that
the matter could not be considered prior to the anticipated forthcoming legal
framework for cannabis by the Government of Canada;
3. Cannabis was legalized in Canada on October 17, 2018. With the legalization of
cannabis by the Federal Government, there is now a legal framework in place
governing the production, sale, possession and use of cannabis;
4. During the 2018 event, VPD counted 482 vendor tents. 420 organizers generate
revenue from fees paid by vendors. The sale of cannabis and cannabis related
products at events such as 420, is not permissible under the new legal
framework. Cannabis products can only legally be purchased through
government licensed outlets;
5. 420 organizers intend to hold their annual protest at Sunset Beach again in 2019
for the fourth year running because another location has not been made
available by the City of Vancouver;
6. Smoking or vaping cannabis in parks and on beaches is prohibited under the
Cannabis Control and Licensing Act as well as the Park Board Smoking
Regulation By-law;

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, February 26, 2019 38
7. Many West End residents have expressed grave concerns with the 420 event at
Sunset Beach due to impact on air quality, noise, vandalism, and resulting
multi-week closures of damaged sensitive grassy park space;
8. In February 2019, the Vancouver Park Board passed a motion that staff send a
letter to the Mayor and Vancouver City Council to request continuation of the
exploration of alternate venues within the City of Vancouver in consultation with
420 organizers, in order to move the protest event to a more appropriate location
that will not cause disruption to West End area residents, seawall users and
Vancouver Aquatic Centre patrons, with the goal of having the event relocated by
2020.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council support the Vancouver Park Board’s request for assistance in
finding an alternate venue for 420.
B. THAT Council direct staff to consult with 420 organizers and the public to identify
an appropriate non-residential neighbourhood site where the 420 event could be
held in future years with due consideration of City by-laws.

6. Shore to Core: Vancouver’s Watershed Revival Plan
MOVED by Councillor Wiebe
SECONDED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
WHEREAS
1. As part of the Investing in Canada plan, Infrastructure Canada will deliver $3.917
Billion through a bilateral agreement with the Province of British Columbia under
four funding streams, including a green infrastructure, over the next ten years.
The City of Vancouver has an opportunity to apply for funding for major
watershed and greenway projects;
2. Metro Vancouver’s Integrated Liquid Waste and Resource Management Plan has
a target to eliminate combined sewer overflows (CSO) by 2050. Clark Drive CSO
pipes release over 10 million cubic meters a year of combined sewer overflow
into Burrard Inlet alone; this can be reduced with better watershed management;

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, February 26, 2019 39
3. The Vancouver Rainwater Management Plan target is for 90% of our annual
average rainfall to be captured, infiltrated or treated, before discharge into the
marine environment, with only extreme storm events to rely on pipes and
road-side gutters;
4. Georgia Straight Alliance’s State of the Waterfront Plan aims to increase the
number of residents who can access the shoreline within a 10 minute walk, which
is currently only 25%;
5. New local area plans, such as the Northeast False Creek Plan, establish high
standards for habitat creation and enhancement of biodiversity in marine and
intertidal zones to developed areas;
6. The Vancouver Park Board’s Biodiversity Strategy has a target to restore or
enhance 25 ha of natural areas by 2020 and emphasizes connecting habitats for
biodiversity such as through the daylighting of creeks. The Vancouver Park
Board is also working on a strategy to foster a greater understanding of past and
present use of local waterways, from pre- to post-colonization, and impacts on
the future of local waterways;
7. Vancouver City Council unanimously approved on February 13, 2019, that staff
report back in Q3 of 2019 with recommendations from the Waterfront Initiative to
create an action plan to improve water quality. This includes restoring aquatic
and riparian ecology and traditional First Nation’s food sources along major
natural waterways, such as Burrard Inlet, False Creek, Lost Lagoon, Fraser River
and Trout Lake, by engaging with communities, industry, local First Nations,
adjacent municipalities, regional, provincial and federal governments;
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to report back with a scope
of work to develop a comprehensive watershed management plan that includes:
i. Goals to recognize cultural importance and use of waterways, to increase
water quality and biodiversity, to naturalize waterways, to increase flood
and storm water management, to increase community access to
waterways, including the creation of surface water features, and to reduce
utility costs;
ii. Prioritized strategies, including for new land acquisition, protecting
existing waterway and habitat connection, daylighting streams (in
particular China Creek, Musqueam Creek, Tatlow Creek, Still Creek,
Vivian Creek, Hastings Creek), intergovernmental coordination with local
First Nations and neighbouring municipalities, and citizen science data
collection; and
iii. Integration with the Rain City Strategy, Healthy City Strategy, Greenest
City 2020 Action Plan, Biodiversity Strategy, Integrated Water
Management Plan and the Vancouver Green Infrastructure Strategy.
