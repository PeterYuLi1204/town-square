2. Equitable BC Hydro Pricing in Distribution Energy Policy for Missing Middle
Housing
MOVED by Councillor Carr
SECONDED by Councillor Boyle
WHEREAS at the Standing Committee on City Finance and Services June 14, 2023,
City staff presented the report “Climate Emergency Action Plan – Additional and
Accelerated Climate Measures” where specific opportunities to streamline electrical
services for missing middle housing and concurrent consultation on related BC Hydro’s
Distribution Extension Policy were discussed and agreed to be an opportunity for
advocacy.
THERERFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council endorse the following resolution with
background for submission to the 2023 Union of British Columbia Municipalities (UBCM)
Convention;
FURTHER THAT staff be directed to forward the resolution to the UBCM no later than
June 30, 2023:
WHEREAS as part of the Homes for People Plan, the Province intends to
introduce legislation in Fall of 2023, that will allow up to four (4) units on a
traditional single-family detached lot. To meet the electrical service needs of
these new homes, the developer could be required to install a pad-mounted
transformer for approximately $75,000 - $100,000 under current BC Hydro policy;
AND WHEREAS BC Hydro is in the process of updating its Distribution
Extension Policy, which specifies how costs related to new or upgraded servicing
connections are recovered. One option being considered by BC Hydro (Option 3)
would see the cost of distribution system improvements spread across all new
and upgraded connections, using a modest per-dwelling-unit charge. This
approach would provide upfront certainty and distribute costs more equitably,
which in turn would support more affordable and lower carbon new housing:
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that UBCM communicate its support for Option
3 for BC Hydro’s Distribution Extension Policy Update to BC Hydro, the BC
Government, and the BC Utilities Commission, and encourage that option be
implemented as quickly as possible.
