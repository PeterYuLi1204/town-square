tourism services, and, as far as possible, enjoy access to monuments and sites of
national cultural importance (Article 30).”
6. On February 21, 2024 the Vancouver City Planning Commission expressed its concern
with the erosion of existing accessibility at a time when the City of Vancouver has made a
commitment to expand access for people with disabilities of all ages, and unanimously
passed the Stanley Park Train Accessibility resolution, and requested its submission for
the consideration of Council.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Mayor and Council affirm that inaccessibility should be understood as a
reflection of structural and systemic ableism, and that removing existing
accessibility should be understood that it may be a violation of the human rights
of people with disabilities.
B. THAT Mayor and Council commit to making all efforts to maintain or improve the
previous level of accessibility as a result of any maintenance, construction,
renovation, update, or other improvement or alteration of Vancouver’s built
environment, space, programs, events, attractions, services, or communications.
C. THAT Council direct staff to amend the Accessibility Strategy to include a
requirement that all efforts be made to prevent any loss of existing accessibility in
any of the City’s programs, services, communications, events, environments, or
spaces, and further develop a policy requiring that any organization receiving
funding, partnering, or endorsement from the City of Vancouver agree to the
same ban.
D. THAT the Park Board be requested to consider preparing a program whereby
individuals unable to participate in the 2023 Stanley Park Train due to
accessibility are compensated via free tickets for the 2024 Train, or some other
means.

obstacles surrounding the restoration process and related safety considerations;
FURTHER THAT Mayor and Council affirm the City's commitment to accessibility
and the right of persons with disabilities to take part and fully participate on an
equal basis with others in the cultural life of the city by:

2. Expanding Free Public WiFi in the Downtown Eastside and Adjacent
Neighbourhoods
The Committee heard from five speakers in support of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Boyle
SECONDED by Councillor Carr
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, March 13, 2024 11
1. Access to free public WiFi is an important tool in reducing the digital divide,
expanding opportunities for people to connect with family and build stronger
social supports, and improving equitable access to knowledge, skill development,
employment and healthcare. As the world moves more and more online, those
without connectivity are being left behind;
2. The City of Vancouver recognizes the significant role free WiFi plays in the lives
of people experiencing homelessness. It offers a vital link to online resources,
essential services, and a means to stay connected with loved ones;
3. Internet or cellular service is also required for people to access a continuum of
services and resources including:
a) The City of Vancouver’s shelter hotline
b) Telehealth for physician access
c) The 811 nurse hotline
d) A range of warning and alert systems, including drug toxicity alerts
e) Access Central, a telephone line that provides access to withdrawal
management (detox) in the Vancouver Coastal Health region
f) Virtual support services such as the Lifeguard App and Brave App, which
offer 24/7 support and supervision for people at risk of overdose and
connections to local resources
g) The National Overdose Response Hotline, which provides 24/7
anonymous and confidential support over the phone through trained peer
supporters
4. These programs save lives, connecting people to shelter, housing, healthcare
and more. However their reach and impact relies on making them as accessible
as possible to the people they are intended to serve, including through expanded
access to cellular or internet connection;
5. Access to public WiFi also provides more opportunity for the city to communicate
to community members during emergencies. During health outbreaks and
extreme weather events it would strengthen the ability for the city and community
organisations to reach residents with important information and updates;
6. Expanded free public WiFi also benefits tourism and small business, allowing
locals and visitors to locate local businesses and attractions and stay connected
while away from home. These benefits would strengthen economic and
community development efforts in neighbourhoods including Gastown,
Chinatown, Strathcona and Hastings Crossing; and
7. The City of Vancouver currently provides 521 free public WiFi locations across
Vancouver, in partnership with Telus and Rogers, provided through a mix of
private and public access buildings, such as community centres, branches of the

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, March 13, 2024 12
Vancouver Public Library, City and Park Board buildings. This includes an
established footprint of free WiFi in the DTES through city owned facilities as well
as VanWiFi.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to report back by the end of
2024 with a plan, timeline and budget for expanding free public WiFi in the Downtown
Eastside. And that this work include but not be limited to:
A. Engaging with community and social service organisations and local businesses
about their capacity and interest in hosting public WiFi access points.
B. Engaging with social housing partners and BC Housing to explore the
possibilities of adding WiFi access points in BC Housing, non-profit and city
owned social housing.
C. Engaging with community organisations and BIAs in adjacent neighbourhoods
about expanding free public WiFi access in Gastown, Chinatown, Strathcona and
Hastings Crossing.

3. The Future of Co-op Housing - A Path to Delivering More Co-op Homes in
Vancouver
The Committee heard from four speakers in support of the motion, one speaker who spoke in
opposition to the motion and two speakers who spoke to other aspects of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
SECONDED by Councillor Meiszner
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. Co-op housing is a model that has enabled the creation of long-term affordable
housing in member-led communities due to a partnered approach between
different levels of government, individual co-ops and the broader co-op housing
sector. With past Federal support terminated decades ago, and existing co-op
developments aging, there hasn’t been a viable, scalable path forward towards
the renewal and creation of significant amounts of new, sustainable, affordable
co-op housing.
2. Renewing aging co-op stock and delivering abundant new co-op homes requires
all levels of government working together to make this happen; and it requires
not just government, but all partners including the non-profit sector.
3. The City of Vancouver recently formed the Vancouver Housing Development
Office with the explicit purpose of utilizing City land to help more middle-income
people attain housing.
4. The City of Vancouver has the opportunity to lever underutilized city-owned land
and turn it into more affordable and attainable homes for people in our city now
and for generations to come. We can accelerate the use of city-owned land for
middle income housing including for families with up to three or four bedrooms.

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, March 13, 2024 15
5. In order to ensure a strong future for Vancouver, and to achieve the City’s
longstanding goal to be a place where neighborhoods are full of families and
young people can afford to live, work and build their life here, it is essential that a
wide range of housing is available and attainable in the city for a diverse
population of residents of all incomes, ages, backgrounds, and household types.
6. The ongoing housing crisis and escalating cost of housing threatens to impact
the quality of life for many Vancouver residents. Rent and mortgage payments
are the two biggest costs overall, and the two biggest inflationary pressures for
people.
7. Vancouver rents are among the highest in the country. According to the live.rent
February 2024 Metro Vancouver Rent Report, the average rents for one-
bedroom, two-bedroom, and three-bedroom units (unfurnished) in the city of
Vancouver are $2,642 (1 br.), $3,569 (2 br.), and $4,369(3 br.).
8. Purchasing a home in Vancouver is equally unattainable for most people.
According to the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver’s (REBGV) December
2023 benchmark Home Price Indexes (HPI) for the west side and east side of
Vancouver for detached, townhouse, and apartment homes ranged from $3.5
million (west side detached) to $780,000 (east side apartment). See table below:
Vancouver – West Vancouver – East
 detached =  detached
$3,465,300 =
$1,812,700
 townhouse =  townhouse
$1,424,700 =
$890,700
 apartment =  apartment =
$816,300 $783,800
9. To meet the needs of Vancouver’s growing population, and to ensure the city
remains vibrant and diverse, it is vital to have a varied supply of available and
attainable housing across the housing continuum and imperative the City is well-
positioned and prepared to fulfill the housing policy directions established by
Council.
10. The City of Vancouver owns and manages hundreds of acres of land on behalf of
Vancouver residents. City-owned land is a significant public asset that should be
optimally managed for public benefit. It can be and is used for housing, arts and
culture, childcare, or other civic purposes.
11. Notable examples of land the City owns, manages, and/or leases for housing
include the majority of the Champlain Heights area which is leasehold property
(on pre-paid 99-year leases expiring in the 2080s), and approximately 80 acres
of land in the 100-acre False Creek South neighborhood.

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, March 13, 2024 16
12. Using publicly owned land to enable a greater supply of new affordable housing,
while also renewing and protecting existing affordable housing, needs to be a
vital part of the solution to the city’s housing crisis.
13. The Housing Vancouver Strategy and Housing Vancouver Action Plan aimed to
deliver more co-op housing through partnerships with senior levels of
government and non-profit and private sector partners, but has been largely
unsuccessful to date due to numerous challenges with the traditional co-op
development model. Increasing co-op housing is also a priority for this Council.
14. Key actions outlined in the Housing Vancouver Strategy and Housing Vancouver
Action Plan included developing and implementing co-op and non-profit renewal
frameworks, and clarifying renewal of lease terms with non-market housing
providers on City-owned sites with redevelopment potential. As outlined in the
Strategy, the City’s goal is to both maintain and grow Vancouver’s non-market
housing portfolio.
15. Co-op housing makes up a significant and important part of the City’s current
affordable non-market and supportive housing portfolio. There are approximately
3,738 co-op units of mixed-income housing on city-owned land – approximately
half of all co-ops in the City. Co-ops represent approximately 23% of the City’s
non-market housing assets by land area and 27% of all non-market housing units
on City-owned land.
16. Co-ops on City of Vancouver land have provided important benefits to their
members and to the broader community. There is significant opportunity to both
preserve and grow mixed income communities on underutilized city-owned land.
17. The Co-operative Housing Federation of BC (CHF BC) has been an important
partner with the City for several years, and have worked with City staff to
advance the mutual goal of renewal of co-op housing leases on City-owned land.
18. In 1993, CHF BC established the Community Land Trust (CLT) as its real estate
development arm to acquire, develop, and steward co-ops and community-led
housing. Land trusts are an effective way to separate the ownership of land (and
in Vancouver’s case the rapidly-rising values of land) from the cost of building
and maintaining homes.
Today in response to rising maintenance costs and asset management
challenges for individual co-ops, CHF BC is exploring a model where it
collectively provides asset management services for co-op developments and its
non-profit members, while enabling them to focus on the day-to-day governance
and management of those co-ops.
19. Many co-op land leases in Vancouver are due to expire over the next few
decades having been signed 40 or more years ago. They need renewal and a
new model and path forward. Critically, at the same time, many of the dozens of
co-op sites on city-owned land are very low density today and have the ability to
accommodate new co-ops and new co-op homes now.

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, March 13, 2024 17
20. An example of the above is the approximately 80 acres of land in False Creek
South the City owns and manages, and where the City has committed to
renewing existing co-ops.
21. In 2021, the City commissioned a city-wide engagement process focused on
future opportunities for the City-owned lands in False Creek South. Vancouver
residents surveyed generally agreed with a development approach that included
a mix of housing tenancy types, developing vacant lands first, a phased
approach that would minimize disruption to the neighbourhood, and using the
proceeds from developing market housing units to fund non-market housing.
22. In October 2021, Council received “The Future of False Creek South: Advancing
a Conceptual Development Plan and Addressing Lease Expiries” report that
outlined a significant opportunity to use the valuable City-owned lands to create a
large number of new affordable homes (and other goals to address sea level rise,
enrich the neighbourhood’s cultural, social and recreational amenities, open up
pedestrian, bicycle and vehicle access to this neighbourhood to better connect it
with the rest of the city).
23. Further, the future vision for False Creek South honours and refreshes the
original 1970s intentional building design, open spaces, and place-making and
aims to achieve the original goal of a mixed-tenure, mixed-income
neighbourhood that provides a broad, accessible array of housing choices within
today’s context, while also looking 50 years into the future.
24. On February 13th the Province of BC announced BC Builds. British Columbia's
BC Builds program will provide more than $2 billion in low cost construction
financing, and will commit up to $950 million in grants to build thousands of
middle-class rental homes on government, non-profit, community-owned, and
underused land.
25. On February 20th, the Federal Government announced a further $2B in
additional funding for the BC Builds program – effectively doubling the initial
Provincial funding established.
26. Given the ongoing housing and affordability crisis facing the city and its impact
on the well-being and quality of life of residents, Council must respond decisively
to opportunities to best optimize city-owned land for needed housing.
27. Co-op housing can continue to work today with fresh thinking, partners working
together, and when projects include a mix of affordability levels including below
market and a percentage of market rental. In co-op housing, the market rent units
may be the same as for-profit market rental on opening day, but over time the
rents decrease as they are not adjusted to market conditions the same way for
profit units are, and so they become the perpetually affordable housing stock of
tomorrow.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to report back as soon as possible on opportunities to
build new co-op housing on existing city-owned land that currently houses co-ops

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, March 13, 2024 18
in neighbourhoods across the City, in order to further the goal of increasing co-op
housing units in Vancouver.
B. THAT the report include immediate and pilot opportunities to partner with the Co-
op Housing Federation of BC (and/or other non-profits) towards exploring and
delivering a new model of co-op housing that retains City ownership of city-
owned land, and supports community land trust models and a consolidated
maintenance and asset management model.
C. THAT Council direct staff to report back with an updated and enhanced False
Creek South Development Plan for Council’s consideration that responds to the
key opportunities and housing pressures presently facing the City and previous
city-wide input on housing as a priority, as well as prior input from the FCS
community, including consideration of but not limited to:
• Retaining City ownership of the False Creek South lands and increasing
the current housing target including co-ops and other housing types;
• Retaining options for existing residents to return to new homes in the
community;
• Creating a more complete community by enabling mixed-use
developments with new, locally-serving services;
• Protecting and expanding existing park and green spaces, and other
community amenities accessible to all Vancouverites;
• Accelerating actions to address climate change through sustainable
development practices and improved transportation options (i.e., walking,
cycling, electric vehicles, and mobility devices, etc.), expanded transit
accessibility, and climate adaptation and mitigation measures to address
rising sea levels and shoreline stability, as per Council direction to staff in
2021;
FURTHER THAT following the presentation of an updated and enhanced False
Creek South (Landowner’s) Conceptual Development Plan to Council, staff be
directed to proceed with the requisite False Creek South community planning
processes and implementation phases as quickly as possible.
D. THAT Council direct staff to identify projects on a priority basis pursuant to the
above that can deliver new attainable middle-income homes, and that can
proceed with support from the Province’s BC Builds program and the Federal
Government’s additional investment.

FINAL MOTION AS APPROVED
WHEREAS
1. Co-op housing is a model that has enabled the creation of long-term affordable
housing in member-led communities due to a partnered approach between
different levels of government, individual co-ops and the broader co-op housing
sector. With past Federal support terminated decades ago, and existing co-op
developments aging, there hasn’t been a viable, scalable path forward towards
the renewal and creation of significant amounts of new, sustainable, affordable
co-op housing.
2. Renewing aging co-op stock and delivering abundant new co-op homes requires
all levels of government working together to make this happen; and it requires
not just government, but all partners including the non-profit sector.
3. The City of Vancouver recently formed the Vancouver Housing Development
Office with the explicit purpose of utilizing City land to help more middle-income
people attain housing.

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, March 13, 2024 20
4. The City of Vancouver has the opportunity to lever underutilized city-owned land
and turn it into more affordable and attainable homes for people in our city now
and for generations to come. We can accelerate the use of city-owned land for
middle income housing including for families with up to three or four bedrooms.
5. In order to ensure a strong future for Vancouver, and to achieve the City’s
longstanding goal to be a place where neighborhoods are full of families and
young people can afford to live, work and build their life here, it is essential that a
wide range of housing is available and attainable in the city for a diverse
population of residents of all incomes, ages, backgrounds, and household types.
6. The ongoing housing crisis and escalating cost of housing threatens to impact
the quality of life for many Vancouver residents. Rent and mortgage payments
are the two biggest costs overall, and the two biggest inflationary pressures for
people.
7. Vancouver rents are among the highest in the country. According to the live.rent
February 2024 Metro Vancouver Rent Report, the average rents for one-
bedroom, two-bedroom, and three-bedroom units (unfurnished) in the city of
Vancouver are $2,642 (1 br.), $3,569 (2 br.), and $4,369(3 br.).
8. Purchasing a home in Vancouver is equally unattainable for most people.
According to the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver’s (REBGV) December
2023 benchmark Home Price Indexes (HPI) for the west side and east side of
Vancouver for detached, townhouse, and apartment homes ranged from $3.5
million (west side detached) to $780,000 (east side apartment). See table below:
Vancouver – West Vancouver – East
 detached =  detached
$3,465,300 =
$1,812,700
 townhouse =  townhouse
$1,424,700 =
$890,700
 apartment =  apartment =
$816,300 $783,800
9. To meet the needs of Vancouver’s growing population, and to ensure the city
remains vibrant and diverse, it is vital to have a varied supply of available and
attainable housing across the housing continuum and imperative the City is well-
positioned and prepared to fulfill the housing policy directions established by
Council.
10. The City of Vancouver owns and manages hundreds of acres of land on behalf of
Vancouver residents. City-owned land is a significant public asset that should be
optimally managed for public benefit. It can be and is used for housing, arts and
culture, childcare, or other civic purposes.
11. Notable examples of land the City owns, manages, and/or leases for housing
include the majority of the Champlain Heights area which is leasehold property
(on pre-paid 99-year leases expiring in the 2080s), and approximately 80 acres
of land in the 100-acre False Creek South neighborhood.

12. Using publicly owned land to enable a greater supply of new affordable housing,

4. Permanent Outdoor Location for an Iconic Vancouver Sign
The Committee heard from four speakers in support of the motion and one speaker who spoke
to other aspects of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Meiszner
SECONDED by Councillor Zhou
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. The temporary outdoor Vancouver sign located in Coal Harbour has quickly
become a popular photo spot for residents and visitors alike and has established
itself as an iconic landmark and symbol for our city;
2. The Vancouver sign in Coal Harbour is the result of an investment made by the
Vancouver Hotel Destination Association (VHDA), in partnership with the
Vancouver Convention Centre and Port of Vancouver, as part of the winter
2023/24 Coal Harbour “Liven Up” activation;
3. Vancouver continues to rank as a top international destination based on its
natural beauty, Indigenous culture, and diversity, along with its commitment to
sustainability, as a gateway to the Pacific Rim with well-integrated tourism
infrastructure, and as a City of Reconciliation;
4. The City of Vancouver has successfully hosted major events in the past such as
the Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games in 2010, and will be hosting the 2024
Grey Cup, the 2025 Invictus Games, and FIFA in 2026, all of which have and/or
will attract thousands of visitors from around the world;
5. Vancouver offers unparalleled destination value and one of the most cohesive
and supportive hospitality networks in the world;
6. Tourism makes a significant contribution to Vancouver’s economy. For every
$100M in Tourism revenue, it has been estimated that there is a further $69M in
economic impact which supports local communities;

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, March 13, 2024 25
7. The Vancouver sign – removed at the end of February – successfully promoted
the city’s brand and identity and has contributed to the city’s vibrant, dynamic
image; and
8. The success and popularity of the Vancouver sign in Coal Harbour has led to
calls for a permanent "Vancouver" sign in a high-profile outdoor location in the
city that can provide a unique and iconic backdrop for events and celebrations
such as the Grey Cup, the Invictus Games, and FIFA 2026 that enhances the
city's branding and provides a memorable photo opportunity for residents and
tourists alike.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to report back by or before
the end of Q3 2024 with recommendations for potential locations, funding sources, and
implementation timelines for a high-profile permanent public outdoor Vancouver sign,
with consideration given to Indigenous design elements and other factors such as
visibility, accessibility, and alignment with the city’s aesthetic and cultural identity and
upcoming major events scheduled in the city such as the Grey Cup, Invictus Games,
and FIFA 2026 World Cup;
FURTHER THAT staff be directed to seek to work with various partners and
stakeholders, including the Vancouver Hotel Destination Association (VHDA), the
Vancouver Convention Centre, Downtown Vancouver Business Improvement
Association, Destination Vancouver, and the Port of Vancouver among others, and
consult with local First Nations, to explore options for a permanent public outdoor
Vancouver sign.

WHEREAS
1. The City of Vancouver is known for, and prides itself on being, a vibrant,
cosmopolitan 21st Century city, attracting businesses and individuals seeking
opportunities in a modern urban setting;

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, March 13, 2024 26
2. A core responsibility of the City and its elected Council is to ensure that an
efficient, modern regulatory framework is in place at all times to foster innovation,
entrepreneurship, and a conducive environment within which businesses can
thrive;
3. Fostering economic activity, growth, and innovation, as well as creating the
conditions to support jobs and employment and a diverse range of commercial
activities, are fundamental to what a city is;
4. Members of Council are frequently alerted to obscure, outdated, and/or
seemingly unnecessary rules and regulations imposed by the City that only
hinder economic growth and frustrate commercial activity. Several current
examples include, but are not limited to:
• Food and liquor establishments that would like to offer Karaoke as an
entertainment option for their customers but are not able to do so
because their zoning and business license category only allow for live
entertainment
• Retail stores, specifically in Gastown, that sell lingerie but are prohibited
from selling other adult-oriented items due to these items being restricted
to the “Adult Retail Store” license category under the City’s Zoning and
Development Bylaw
• Bars and liquor-serving establishments that would like to include arcade
entertainment for their customers’ enjoyment but are unable to do so
based on current zoning and business license category restrictions
5. It is incumbent upon Council to address policies, rules, and/or regulations and
policy frameworks brought to their attention that needlessly hinder and/or impede
innovation, entrepreneurship, and/or only serve to frustrate legitimate commercial
activity and the city’s economic competitiveness; and
6. By rectifying known impediments to Vancouver's economic competitiveness and
the city’s ability to attract investment and create local job opportunities, Council is
tangibly demonstrating a collective commitment to promoting a dynamic and
thriving business economy.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to review the specific
business license situations referenced in the preamble of this motion, all of which have
been brought to the attention of the elected members of Council and report back with
any recommended by-law and zoning amendments and/or any associated implications
that would result from such actions;
FURTHER THAT staff be directed to conduct this work in collaboration with
representatives from the relevant industries, the local businesses affected, and other
stakeholders to ensure that the City’s rules and regulations in this regard are relevant,
meaningful, and demonstrate the City’s adaptability to the ever-evolving economic and
business landscape in our city.

6. Improving Access to Beverage Container Recycling in Vancouver
The Committee heard from one speaker in support of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Dominato
SECONDED by Councillor Klassen
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. The City of Vancouver is committed to reducing the impact of single-use plastics,
including empty beverage containers, and ensuring recyclable materials are kept
out of landfills, waterways, and oceans;
2. Recycling beverage containers helps preserve the environment by reducing
demand for new raw materials for packaging and decreases the energy used to
create new cans, cartons, and bottles;
3. The Provincial government’s recycling regulations require a minimum recovery
rate of 75% under the extended producer responsibilities, managed for the
industry by Return-It / Encorp Pacific, including a requirement for continuous
improvement;
4. The City of Vancouver has the fewest number of return facilities/depots per
capita among urban centres in the Province of British Columbia;
5. In 2022, the City of Vancouver had the lowest return rate for deposit/return
beverage containers of any city in British Columbia and the lowest in the Metro
Vancouver area (approximately 51%);
6. Research indicates that beverage container recycling rates increase when return-
for-refund options are convenient for residents;
7. Current City of Vancouver zoning and permitting by-laws state that new recycling
depots must be located on industrial zoned lands. The permit processing
timelines are also lengthy and, in many cases, onerous;
8. Lands zoned for industrial use in Vancouver have been shrinking over the course
of many decades to accommodate other land uses and various encroachments.
The cost of these lands has correspondingly risen;
9. Consumers/residents do not always find it convenient to travel to the city’s
remaining industrial zones to return empty beverage containers;

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, March 13, 2024 28
10. Depots for returning empty beverage containers are fundamentally retail in
nature. They serve to collect containers and return a deposit to consumers.
Depots do not actually recycle the containers in an industrial sense; and
11. Returning empty beverage containers to commercial or retail zones in the city
would be much more accessible and convenient for consumers and would not
represent an industrial activity in any traditionally understood sense.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to prepare amendments to
the City’s zoning by-laws to allow for empty beverage container return centres (including
permanent buildings and repurposed shipping containers) to be located in commercial
and retail zones, in addition to industrial zones, in order to improve access to empty
beverage container recycling for Vancouver residents and improve the city’s return rate
for empty beverage containers;
FURTHER THAT staff be directed to report back to Council with the aforementioned
proposed amendments to the City’s zoning by-laws by the end of Q2 of 2024, so that
Council can consider referring the proposed amendments to a Public Hearing.
