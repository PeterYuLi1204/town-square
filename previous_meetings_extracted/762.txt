WHEREAS
1. Caring for all community residents during the COVID-19 public health emergency
is a joint responsibility of all levels of government;
2. The 2020 Metro Vancouver preliminary homeless count found in Vancouver 547
people living unsheltered on the City’s streets, with 1,548 people with no fixed
address living in sheltered locations;
3. Many unsheltered residents are vulnerable people with underlying health issues
such as mental illness and addiction;
4. A disproportionately high number of unsheltered residents are Indigenous people
- many of whom are survivors of residential schools and other deplorable
vestiges of our colonial past;

Special Council Meeting
Minutes, September 11 and 14, 2020 3
5. The policy responses to the COVID-19 pandemic such as physical distancing
and other measures have left many marginalized people in precarious living
conditions;
6. The recent spike in COVID-19 cases, a toxic illicit drug supply escalating
overdoses, and the coming colder weather require urgent action to provide
unsheltered residents safer short- and long-term shelter options and improved
access to sanitation, health, and social services; and
7. The estimated 300 residents living unsheltered in Strathcona Park are at
increasing risk in terms of health and violence and the current encampment does
not have the facilities or services to accommodate long-term habitation.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT City staff report back to Council by or before October 2, 2020, on the
feasibility and costs of the following three options to accelerate the creation of
emergency housing for homeless Vancouver residents:
Option 1: Leasing or purchasing housing units including hotels, single-
room occupancy residences, and other available housing stock;
Option 2: Establishing a temporary emergency relief encampment on
vacant public or private land; and
Option 3: Temporarily converting City-owned buildings into emergency
housing or shelter space.
B. THAT City of Vancouver staff work with other partner agencies to outline
supportive services for each option including overdose prevention, access to
safer supply, other health services such as COVID-19 testing facilities, as well as
culturally-appropriate services with emphasis on Indigenous traditions of healing
and wellness.
C. THAT once approved by Council, City staff work with BC Housing and other
government and non-profit agencies to invite unsheltered residents to move into
housing units or shelter spaces, then to more permanent housing, as it becomes
available.
D. THAT staff also work with BC Housing and other government departments and
agencies to secure long-term housing options for unsheltered residents, including
and purchasing and refurbishing single-room occupancy residences or other
available housing stock.
E. THAT staff work to expedite the necessary planning approval of the 450 modular
housing units recently and jointly announced with the Province.
F. THAT staff work with the Province to expedite the newly announced navigation
centre.
