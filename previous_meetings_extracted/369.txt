2. Piloting a Pedestrian Scramble Crossing Trial in Vancouver
MOVED by Councillor Meiszner
SECONDED by Councillor Zhou
WHEREAS
1. Transportation decisions in Vancouver generally reflect a hierarchy of
transportation modes, with walking as the top priority;
2. Increasing the walkability and accessibility of Vancouver's streets and sidewalks
is a priority of the City and has been supported by successive City Councils,
including measures such as sidewalk curb ramps on street corners to create
access for people using wheelchairs, walkers, and strollers to enable all
residents to participate fully in the community, regardless of ability; i
3. According to Walk Score, Vancouver is considered to be a “Very Walkable” city
with an overall walk score of 80. Most errands can be accomplished on foot,
according to Walk Score, and some areas of the city have walk scores greater
than 80 such as Downtown (97), the West End (95), Fairview (93), Mount
Pleasant (92), and Strathcona (92);
4. Many cities around the world use pedestrian scrambles to provide safe and
accessible crossings in high-pedestrian areas. Pedestrian scrambles enhance
walkability, which encourages more people to choose travel options that are
active, healthy, and environmentally sustainable, while increasing foot traffic that
supports local business;
5. A pedestrian scramble is an exclusive pedestrian crossing phase at a signalized
intersection where vehicular movements are prohibited at all approaches while
pedestrians are permitted to cross diagonally and longitudinally. The separation
of vehicular and pedestrian movements is intended to reduce conflicts between
the two modes; ii

Council Meeting
Minutes, April 25 and 26, 2023 19
6. In July 2019, the City of Vancouver implemented a trial “all-walk” crosswalk
phase at Hornby and Robson whereby all vehicle traffic was stopped and
pedestrians could walk from any corner at the same time within the existing
painted crosswalks, around or through the four corners of Robson and Hornby
Street;
7. In contrast to the “all-walk” crosswalk trial at Hornby and Robson, a traditional
pedestrian scramble differs by allowing diagonal crossing in any direction through
an intersection;
8. A pedestrian scramble was considered in the design stage for the Hornby and
Robson trial, but the all-walk phase was chosen to provide increased walk time
for pedestrians who could also proceed in the south crosswalk with eastbound
left turning vehicles given that there would be no vehicle/pedestrian conflict within
the south crosswalk during this phase;
9. Public interest in a traditional pedestrian scramble in Vancouver, as opposed to
an all-walk crosswalk phase, is longstanding and has frequently been raised as
an option during planning and consultation processes. Potential locations for
pedestrian scrambles suggested by the public range from Broadway & Cambie to
the crossing at 1st and Commercial;
10. Subsequent to the Hornby and Robson all-walk phase trial, staff were set to
analyze the intersection operation to assess whether the longer-term roll-out
would also include diagonal crossing and whether it could be a new tool for the
City’s engineering action plan; iii
11. As of the current date, Vancouver has not piloted or trialed a traditional
pedestrian scramble crossing, including diagonal crossing, to assess its
effectiveness in the local Vancouver context and determine its value in terms of
the City’s pedestrian and traffic safety best practices and enhanced mobility.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to report back by the end of
Q3 2023 with recommendations and potential location options for a traditional pedestrian
scramble crossing pilot that includes diagonal crossing, inclusive of a range of
appropriate intersection examples in the city with high levels of pedestrian traffic in order
to assess the effectiveness of scramble crossings in the local Vancouver context and
determine their value in terms of the City’s pedestrian and traffic safety best practices
and enhanced mobility objectives.

i The City of Vancouver has long recognize the importance of sidewalk accessibility and has been installing over 200 curb ramps per
year since the 1960s. There are curb ramps on more than 95% of sidewalk curbs in the downtown core.
https://vancouver.ca/streets-transportation/pedestrian-accessibility.aspx
ii Pedestrian scramble phasing is most likely to be successful and have fewer violations at intersections with large volumes of both
pedestrians and motor vehicles. Pedestrian scramble phase usually creates a longer cycle length and wait between crossings.
https://vancouver.ca/files/cov/pedestrian-safety-study-2012-final-report.pdf
iii A joint safety study with UBC showed a 96% reduction in vehicle-pedestrian conflicts during the Hornby and Robson all-walk
phase trial. This pilot will become permanent as part of the Robson Plaza project, and a second all-walk phase crossing is to be
installed on the other side of the plaza at the Howe-Robson intersection. Staff will continue to look for other suitable locations for this
type of intervention. https://council.vancouver.ca/20200707/documents/r2.pdf

as the mover of the motion.
* * * * *
MOVED by Councillor Fry
SECONDED by Councillor Boyle
WHEREAS
1. Vancouver is committed to Vision Zero: ending all traffic-related serious injuries
and fatalities in the City of Vancouver;
2. Any amount of traffic-related serious injuries or fatalities on Vancouver streets is
unacceptable and the City of Vancouver should prioritize the safety and well-
being of residents;
3. There is strong evidence that vehicle speed increases both the probability and
severity of motor vehicle crashes, making speed reduction an important part of a
larger Vision Zero strategy. Studies show that if a driver hits a pedestrian at 50
km/h, the pedestrian only has approximately a 20% chance of survival, but that
their chance of survival goes up to 90% if the speed is 30 km/h;
4. In March 2023 the Schools on Arterials Slow Zones pilot launched and reduced
speeds on streets beside nine Elementary Schools, with a focus on reducing
accidents and improving safety for children and families. Henry Hudson
Elementary School is part of this pilot, with speed reduced to 40 km/h on
Cornwall Avenue between Cypress Street and Maple Street from 8:00 am - 5:00
pm on school days;
5. In light of a tragic car crash at the intersection of Cornwall Avenue and Arbutus
Street on July 20, 2022, local residents are asking for Council to expand the
Schools on Arterials Slow Zones pilot to protect all road users on Cornwall
Avenue, recognizing that Cornwall Avenue is used to access not just Henry
Hudson Elementary School, but also Henry Hudson Child Care Society pre-

Council Meeting
Minutes, April 25 and 26, 2023 21
school and daycare, Kitsilano Beach park, Kitsilano Pool, and several other key
social and cultural institutions in Vancouver and the homes of thousands of
residents; and
6. The Schools on Arterials Slow Zones pilot presents an opportunity to pilot an
expanded reduced speed pilot further along Cornwall, from Burrard Street to
Trafalgar, improving safety for thousands of residents, as well as thousands of
visitors to the area during the summer months, and to collect data to inform
longer term safety improvements for drivers, passengers, pedestrians, people on
bikes, and micromobility users.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Vancouver City Council direct staff to extend the
Schools on Arterials Slow Zones pilot on Cornwall Avenue, specifically by reducing the
speed limit for all of Cornwall Avenue (Trafalgar Street through to Burrard Street), and
reducing the speed to 30 km/h at all times (24/7), and to so do by July 2023, to maximize
safety benefits for thousands of summer visitors to Kitsilano Beach and Kitsilano Pool;
FURTHER THAT staff collect data on the expanded Cornwall slow zone and report
back, as part of the report back on results of the pilot in Spring 2024, to make other
recommendations for improving safety on Cornwall Avenue for pedestrians, people on
bikes, micromobility users, drivers and passengers, including for:
a. Improving visibility for drivers by removing parking in sections that obstruct
sightlines;
b. Consideration of adding bollards or other barriers to protect Henry Hudson
Elementary School and Henry Hudson Child Care Society, as well as possible
bollards on the NW corner of Cornwall and Arbutus between the sidewalk and the
park space;
c. Prohibiting left turns between 7am and 7pm, unless there is a turning lane and turn
signal or an intersection controlled by stop signs, and looking to add dedicated turn
phases at intersections where possible;
d. Adding leading pedestrian intervals at all controlled crosswalks; and
e. Working with TransLink to incorporate bus priority measures to reflect the high
volume of transit riders that use this corridor and to maximize the safety benefits of
transit use, including considering bus bulbs and/or bus lanes.
