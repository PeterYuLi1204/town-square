MOVED by Councillor Carr
SECONDED by Councillor Boyle
THAT the Vancouver City Council Business Licence Hearing Panel not issue a business
license to Gary Buchanan (the “Licencee) for a short-term rental accommodation at

December 10, 2021, of doing business as a short-term rental without a license and that this
conviction is sufficiently connected by the nature of the business to the requested business
license at 414 - 180 East 2nd Avenue.
