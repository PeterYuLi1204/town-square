FURTHER THAT the draft zoning amendment by-law, prepared for the Public

AND FURTHER THAT the above approval be subject to the Conditions of
Approval contained in Appendix B of the above-noted report, with the following
amendments:
(i) THAT condition 1.14 of the Conditions of Approval of the Development
Application as contained in Appendix B, Part 1, of the above-noted report
be corrected to read as follows:
“1.14 This development will be required to provide on-site rainwater
management in accordance with Building By-law requirements

Public Hearing
Minutes, November 12 and 14, 2024 4
(ii) THAT condition 2.2(b) of the Conditions of By-law Enactment as
contained in Appendix B, Part 2, of the above-noted report be corrected
to read as follows:
“b. Provision of adequate sewer (storm and sanitary) service to meet
the demands of the project, implementation of development(s) at
3983-3991 West 10th Avenue requires the:
(i) development to be serviced to the existing 250 mm SAN
and 900 mm STM sewers in the Lane/North of West 10th
Avenue; and
(ii) post-development 10-year flow rate discharged to the
storm sewer shall be no greater than the 2-year pre-
development flow rate. The pre-development estimate
shall utilize the 2014 IDF curves, whereas the post-
development estimate shall utilize the 2100 IDF curves to
account for climate change.
Note to Applicant: Offsite upgrades are not conditioned to the
development site because the servicing strategy of this area is
under investigation and future servicing scope of this area is not
defined. The development site release rate requirement is
intended to mitigate the increased development discharge flows
(increased imperviousness and population) and maintain existing
sewer capacity conditions of the surrounding sewers.
Note to Applicant: The required sewer modifications on public land
are located in or near an archeologically sensitive area.
Archeological review/studies will be required prior to construction.”
B. THAT subject to approval in principle of the rezoning and the Housing Agreement

By-law be amended, generally as set out in Appendix C of the Referral Report
dated September 24, 2024, entitled “Rezoning: 3983-3991 West 10th Avenue”;
FURTHER THAT the Director of Legal Services be instructed to bring forward the
amendment to the Subdivision By-law at the time of enactment of the zoning
amendment by-law.
