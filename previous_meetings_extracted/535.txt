Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, February 09, 2022 6
5. Representation from the City of Vancouver and other cities within Metro
Vancouver on the TransLink Board would open the door for more local initiatives
to increase accessibility and affordability of transit for our communities, which
would make it easier to meet our climate goals;
6. The Metro Vancouver Mayors’ Council on Regional Transportation has
consistently and including during the 2020 British Columbia general election,
urged the provincial government to move ahead with a promised review of
TransLink’s governance structure, where a majority of people around the table

7. The City of Vancouver’s Transportation Advisory Committee and Seniors
Advisory Committee have both supported this motion.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council request the Mayor to write to the
BC Government and urge them to reconfigure the Board of TransLink to allow for

FURTHER THAT Council refer this motion to the Racial and Ethno Cultural
Equity Advisory Committee for further consideration;”

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, February 09, 2022 7
2. The Racial and Ethno-Cultural Equity Advisory Committee (RECE) considered
the motion and a request for the City to help finance a legal challenge to
Quebec’s Bill 21 on January 13, 2022;
3. The legal challenge is currently in the appeal process at the Quebec Court of
Appeal, and then if there is no resolution, it will be escalated to the Supreme
Court of Canada;
4. The legal challenge is being led by the World Sikh Organization of Canada,
National Council of Canadian Muslims, and the Canadian Civil Liberties
Association (https://ccla.org/major-cases-and-reports/bill-21/);
5. The Racial and Ethno-Cultural Equity Advisory Committee (RECE) noted the
growing list of incidents of Islamophobia, not just in Quebec, but also in BC;

motion calling on Vancouver Council to contribute a minimum of $100,000 to
support the court case, similar to Brampton which has a smaller population than
Vancouver;
10. Vancouver City Council believes we cannot allow the defense of the Charter and
the foundational value of religious freedom to be on the backs of racialized
communities against the Province of Quebec with unlimited legal resources;
11. If Canadian cities assist to fund the legal challenge we level the playing field
since it is not a fair legal fight in the absence of federal government involvement;
12. A Supreme Court decision allowing infringement of religious freedom would have
negative consequences for Vancouver residents and all Canadians; and
13. Contributing money to the court case would be a concrete way of showing
solidarity with Muslims, Sikhs, and others disproportionately affected by Bill 21 in
BC and across Canada, and will show that Vancouver is willing to act as well as
talk about opposing discrimination against racialized people.

6. Aligning Vancouver’s 2023-2026 Capital Plan with Increased Climate Emergency Action
(Member’s Motion B.4)
At the Council meeting on February 8, 2022, Council referred the following motion to the
Standing Committee on City Finance and Services meeting on February 9, 2022, in order to
hear from speakers, followed by debate and decision.
The Committee heard from five speakers in support of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Carr
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. The City of Vancouver develops 4-year capital plans aligned with the 4-year
election cycle and approval of the capital plan by public vote at the time of a civic

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, February 09, 2022 11
election, the next one to be held October 15, 2022;
2. Developing and implementing the City’s capital plan is typically an eight-year
process: two years to prepare the plan, four years to implement it and two follow-
up years to complete construction and wrap up projects. This means that the
2023-2026 capital plan, with projects wrapped up by 2028, must be sufficiently
robust to ensure we achieve our city’s Climate Emergency Action Plan (CEAP)
goals to reduce Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions by 50% by 2030. Because
Vancouver has only reduced emissions by 15% to date, the 2023-2026 capital
plan should aim to reduce our emissions by close to 35%;
3. Climate scientists are urging governments at all levels to more rapidly reduce
GHGs to prevent runaway global warming. If we do not reduce GHGs by at least
50% by 2030 and to net zero carbon by 2050 they predict that climate events
such as last summer’s “heat dome” that resulted in the deaths of 595 British
Columbians, 99 of which were Vancouverites, last fall’s “atmospheric river” that
caused extensive flooding, landslides and severe damage to transportation
infrastructure, the unprecedented tornado in Pacific Spirit Park, and the stronger
winds coupled with a higher king tide due to rising sea levels seriously damaged
Vancouver’s seawall this January, will become more common and more severe in
the future.
4. Youth, such as Greta Thunberg on a global level, and the Sustainabiliteens in
Vancouver, are calling for political leadership on climate change mitigation stating
their future is at stake. Leadership is needed at all levels of government.
Leadership both inspires and generates more leadership;
5. On November 3, 2021, staff delivered their first CEAP update to Council stating:
“the next capital plan is a significant opportunity to consider CEAP funding”;
6. As part of Vancouver 2022 Operating Budget passed on
December 7, 2021, Council created an annual $9 million fund dedicated to new
climate emergency action specifically directing that the 2022 funding be spent on
measures that will undoubtedly require additional capital spending;
7. Investing more in reducing GHGs now will reduce the greater future costs of
adapting to climate-caused changes including more extreme temperatures and
rising sea levels, and repairing climate-caused damages to our natural and built
environments;
8. Staff’s November 3, 2021, Report to Council on CEAP noted surveys showing
that 90% of Vancouver residents are concerned about climate but only 10%
understand the type and scale of action needed, including that the city must use
all tools: regulation, advocacy and investment, and increase accountability by
tracking milestones, outcomes and expenditures; and
9. City staff also noted in the November 3, 2021, CEAP Report that there are
considerable co-benefits to investments in climate action, including better health,
more green space, more equitable and lower cost transportation and an
estimation that an overall investment of $1.3B in CEAP measures will generate

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, February 09, 2022 12
$2.2B in savings including $1B in savings for Vancouver’s residents and
businesses over the next decade alone.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to:
1. Report back for Council’s consideration early in the 2023-2027 capital
budget planning process a list of potential capital projects, with
associated costs, benefits and estimated GHG reductions, to:
i. Achieve the necessary reductions in our city’s GHG emissions to
reach, at minimum, our stated goal of 50% reductions in GHG
emissions below 2007 levels by 2030 and that would significantly
move us to being a net zero carbon city by 2050;
ii. Simultaneously achieve equity and resilience objectives, including
energy retrofits of city and non-profit owned social and non-market
rental housing and childcare facilities, increasing the tree canopy
city-wide, and increasing renewable energy production including
solar hot water and solar voltaic as a resilience measure;
2. Ensure the needed capital funding is in place in the 2022-2026 capital
plan to complete new climate emergency projects funded through the
city’s annual $9 million climate levy including those noted in the city’s
2022 Operating Budget:
i. Electric vehicle infrastructure including EV chargers, power drops
for community events, chargers in rental buildings and charging
infrastructure for the city’s fleet and equipment;
ii. Transportation measures including transit, slow streets, and
walking and cycling improvements including to Vancouver schools;
iii. Building retrofits for Vancouver civic facilities including community
centers and libraries to reduce GHGs and provide safe centers
during extreme weather events;
3. Establish a regular reporting schedule to Council and the public on the
costs and benefits of the funded projects and their contribution to meeting
our city’s climate emergency goals including emission reductions,
increased resiliency and social and economic benefits; and
4. Continue to seek partnership funding from senior governments and other
sources to help finance and more quickly implement climate emergency
projects.
B. THAT Council direct the Mayor to write letters on behalf of Council to the BC
Urban Mayors Caucus (BCUMC), Union of BC Municipalities (UBCM) and
Federation of Canadian Municipalities (FCM) to advocate for predictable funding

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, February 09, 2022 13
to enable achieving the Paris Accord targets of reducing GHGs by 50% by 2030
and net zero carbon by 2050, and cost-sharing arrangements with senior levels
of government to help fund and more quickly implement climate emergency
projects.
amended
AMENDMENT MOVED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
THAT the following be added as C:
THAT Council direct staff to report back for Council’s consideration early in the
2023-2026 capital budget planning process a list of potential capital projects for
addressing Vancouver’s combined sewer overflows in support of the commitment
to accelerate action on overflow reduction using a “One Water” integrated
approach, with associated costs and environmental benefits.
