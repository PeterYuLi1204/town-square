Minutes, Tuesday, September 16, 2025 2
1. Standardized Apartment Districts and City-Initiated Zoning Changes to Implement
Broadway Plan and Cambie Corridor Plan
An application by the General Manager of Planning, Urban Design and Sustainability was
considered as follows:
Summary: To amend the Zoning and Development By-law to introduce new standardized
R3 low-rise, R4 mid-rise and R5 high-rise residential district schedules and to
rezone certain areas of the Broadway Plan and the Cambie Corridor Plan. In
many cases, this initiative would eliminate the need to apply for a rezoning,
enabling applicants to proceed directly to a development permit application.
Where a site-specific rezoning application is necessary, applicants may
rezone to the new standardized district schedules rather than a customized
CD-1 district.
The General Manager of Planning, Urban Design and Sustainability recommended approval
subject to conditions set out in the summary and recommendation.
Council had before it a yellow memorandum dated September 2, 2025, entitled "Standardized
Apartment Districts and City-Initiated Zoning Changes to Implement Broadway Plan and
Cambie Corridor Plan – Amendment to Council Report”, which noted corrections to Appendix A
and Appendix I of the Referral Report dated June 30, 2025, entitled “Standardized Apartment
Districts and City-Initiated Zoning Changes to Implement Broadway Plan and Cambie Corridor
Plan”.
Council also had before it a second yellow memorandum dated September 12, 2025, entitled
"Standardized Apartment Districts and City-Initiated Zoning Changes to Implement Broadway
Plan and Cambie Corridor Plan – Amendments to Council Report and Draft Zoning and
Development By-law”, which determined a correction was required to remove three sites,
comprised of seven parcels, from the City-initiated rezoning. The yellow memorandum directed
that the three CD-1 By-laws for the sites be excluded from the City-initiated rezoning, which
impacted the Referral Report dated June 30, 2025, entitled “Standardized Apartment Districts
and City-Initiated Zoning Changes to Implement Broadway Plan and Cambie Corridor Plan”,
and the Draft By-law to amend the Zoning and Development By-law.
