Iain Dixon, Assistant Director – Regulatory Litigation, Legal Department, was present on behalf
of the City of Vancouver. Hao-Hsun Lan, the Applicant, was present on her own behalf.
Mr. Dixon provided opening remarks and reviewed relevant legislation as set out in section 275
of the Vancouver Charter and section 4(3) of Licence By-law No. 4450. Mr. Dixon advised that
the Chief Licence Inspector was unable to issue a 2022 business licence to the Applicant
because the Applicant pled guilty in provincial court to one count of carrying on a short-term
rental business at 374 East 28th Avenue without having an appropriate business licence last
year.
In support of the allegations set out in the evidence brief, Mr. Dixon called Koji Miyaji, Assistant
Director, Community Standards, Development, Buildings and Licencing, as a witness.
Mr. Dixon and the Panel directed questions to the Mr. Miyaji who, for clarity, provided a history
of by-law non-compliance involving the Applicant.
Hao-Hsun Lan, the Applicant, provided opening remarks and summarized the issue. She
advised that she has been living at 374 East 28th Avenue since August 2020, and that she only
advertised the one unit for a short-term rental, not the whole house as indicated in the evidence.
Ms. Lan also added that she needed the short-term rental income to cover legal fees in relation
to a divorce and child support.
During questions from the Panel, the Applicant clarified that there is a door to the short-term
rental unit that is locked and cannot be accessed from the other side due to blockade.
In response to questions from the Panel, Mr. Dixon provided clarification regarding by-law
compliance for short-term rentals and explained why the Applicant’s unit is not eligible for a
short-term rental business licence.
