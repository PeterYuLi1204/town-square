MOVED by Councillor Reimer
SECONDED by Councillor Jang
WHEREAS
1. On November 14, 2017, a motion was introduced at Council seeking greater
financial disclosure from members of Council who list as sources of income
public relations firms, government relations firms, consultancies, holding
companies of other entities which obscure pecuniary interest;
2. Councillors Affleck, Ball, Bremner and De Genova declared conflict of interest on
the motion and left the meeting;
3. The remaining members of Council voted unanimously to refer the motion until
such time as Councillors could be given better legal advice on the purpose and
intention of declaring oneself in conflict on an item;
4. The motion was subsequently brought back to Council for debate on
December 13, 2017, at which point Councillors Affleck, Ball, Bremner and De
Genova declared they had a “bias” and left the Council Chamber for the
remainder of the debate during which the motion passed unanimously;
5. In order to ensure that members of Council are both accurate and
comprehensive in their financial disclosures, and with the intent for Council to
seek stricter rules for more transparent disclosure from those employed as
lobbyists, public relations or government relations consultants and also serving
on Council, it is advisable to request changes to the provincial Financial
Disclosure Act;
6. In the interim a complaint has been brought forward against a member of Council
that alleges conflict of interest based on the fact that the member works as a
public relations consultant and his potential pecuniary interests are obscured as
a result;
7. The public has an increasing interest in greater transparency in government but
the current Financial Disclosure Act does not provide for transparency in the
potential conflicts for members of a Council that are externally employed as
lobbyists or government and public relation consultants on behalf of other private
interests;

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, Tuesday, May 1, 2018 22
8. The Province of British Columbia states on the government website that "The
intent of the Financial Disclosure Act is to identify what areas of influence and
possible financial benefit an elected official, nominee or designated employee
might have by virtue of their office, and to ensure the public has reasonable
access to the information."
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council put forward Appendix A to the
Motion entitled “Requesting Provincial Action to Ensure Full Disclosure of
Financial Interests by Municipally Elected Officials”, to the Union of British
Columbia Municipalities (UBCM) requesting amendments to the Financial
Disclosure Act to ensure the public has access to information on potential
conflicts of interest for members of Council who list as sources of income public
relations firms, government relations firms, consultancies, holding companies or
other entities which obscure pecuniary interest.
APPENDIX A – MOTION TO UBCM
FULL DISCLOSURE OF FINANCIAL INTERESTS BY MUNICIPAL ELECTED
OFFICIALS
WHEREAS
1. The Province of British Columbia states on the government website that "The
intent of the Financial Disclosure Act is to identify what areas of influence and
possible financial benefit an elected official, nominee or designated employee
might have by virtue of their office, and to ensure the public has reasonable
access to the information.";
2. While the current Financial Disclosure Act requires disclosure of direct
employment conflicts, it does not require disclosure of potential conflicts for
municipally elected officials where the conflicts may be obscured as a result of
them being employed as lobbyists or government and public relation consultants
on behalf of other private interests.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT the Financial Disclosure Act be amended to
ensure that all potential conflicts and financial interests of municipally elected officials
are disclosed per the stated intent of the Act.

2. Confirming Support for Taking Big Money Out of Municipal Politics
The following motion contains changes from the original Motion on Notice which were accepted
by Council.
MOVED by Councillor Reimer
SECONDED by Councillor Jang
WHEREAS
1. In 2005, 2009, 2010, 2012, and 2013, via a motion endorsed by the Union of
British Columbia Municipalities, and in 2014, 2015, and 2017, the City of
Vancouver has unanimously endorsed formal requests to the Province
requesting changes to the Vancouver Charter to allow Vancouver to create rules
to take big money out of municipal politics including:
i. a full ban on union and corporate donations,
ii. caps on contributions from individuals,
iii. election spending limits,
iv. ongoing reporting between elections,
v. and better measures for enforcement of the rules;
2. The funds used to campaign for elected office in Vancouver grew from $1 million
to $5.85 million in the years Vancouver waited for Provincial government action
on this issue, with the unprecedented case in the 2011 Vancouver municipal
election of $1 million donated to one elector organization from a single
corporation;
3. Frustrated with a lack of action by the last provincial government, in 2016
Vancouver City Council voted unanimously to ask for a referendum during the
provincial election on the question of big money in municipal politics;
4. The new provincial government subsequently passed Bill 15 – Local Elections
Campaign Financing Amendment Act with the intent of taking all big money out
of municipal politics effective October 31, 2017;
5. In April 2018 it came to light that an electoral organization intended to fundraise
from corporate donors for “operating expenses” during the 2018 election year;
6. The Minister responsible for Municipal Affairs has subsequently referred to this
practice as contrary to the intent of Bill 15, and resulting from an unintended
loophole in the Act which she intends to fix.

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, Tuesday, May 1, 2018 24
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT the City of Vancouver:
• Thank the Provincial Government for acting swiftly to ensure that bans on
corporate and union donations, and individual donations over $1,200 are
clearly applicable to all municipal political activities.
B. THAT the City of Vancouver:
• Reiterate our call for regulating Municipal Electoral Organizations in between
elections, including a 100% ban on Corporate and Union donations, a $1,200
limit on individual donors and ongoing reporting of donations to municipal
electoral organizations.
C. THAT all elector organizations disclose:
• Any and all donations received from corporations, unions or individual
donations over $1,200 since October 31, 2017;
• If money raised was outside the intent of Bill 15 since October 31, 2017,
when the law came into force, an itemized account of how this money was
spent.
amended
AMENDMENT MOVED by Councillor Affleck
SECONDED by Councillor Bremner
THAT the motion be struck and replaced with the following:
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Vancouver City Council call on the Provincial Government and
Municipal Affairs and Housing Minister, Selina Robinson, to take
immediate steps to correct well-known flaws in the Local Elections
Campaign Financing Act (LECFA), such as (but not limited to):
• Cracking down on political activities carried out by Third-Party
groups that have all the attributes of an elector organization –
including engaging in well-funded campaign-style work such as
polling, voter identification, and “get out the vote” (GOTV)
activities – but without being subject to the same financial scrutiny
by Elections BC and restrictions under the Act.
• Correcting a serious loophole in the legislation that skirts the intent
of having a contribution limit – not to mention contravening the
letter and spirit of establishing a level playing field for all

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, Tuesday, May 1, 2018 25
candidates – whereby a donor can contribute $1,200 to an
“independent” candidate and also contribute additional $1,200
amounts to any number of other “independent” candidates who
can then pool their campaign contributions and share campaign
costs (effectively operating as an elector organization in all but
name) while unfairly limiting candidates who affiliate with an
elector organization to a single $1,200 contribution for the entire
group of elector organization candidates.
B. THAT Vancouver City Council reiterate its support for removing “big
money” from local government election campaigns, as articulated by
Council on numerous occasions, including in a tri-party letter dated
November 20, 2017, signed by Councillor George Affleck (NPA),
Councillor Adriane Carr (Green Party), and Councillor Andrea Reimer
(Vision Vancouver), and sent to British Columbia’s Minister of Municipal
Affairs and Housing, Selina Robinson, re: Bill 15 – The Local Elections
Campaign Financing Amendment Act, 2017; and
FURTHER THAT Vancouver City Council also confirm its commitment to
the letter and spirit of the November 20, 2017, tri-party letter to Minister
Selina Robinson, which – among other things – noted a) British
Columbia’s long, proud history of campaigns involving elector
organizations and the successful, progressive governments they have
contributed toward, b) a call for contributions to candidates running with
elector organizations to be in line with contributions to candidates running
as independents, c) Council’s call for ongoing reporting by elector
organizations between elections, along with better measures for
enforcement of the rules, and d) an offer from all parties currently
represented on Council to engage with the Minister “on any future
revision or changes to the bill once enacted” with the aim to improve
public confidence in local government elections.
C. THAT Vancouver City Council call on all three elector organizations
currently represented on Vancouver City Council (namely, Vision
Vancouver, the Vancouver Green Party, and the Vancouver NPA) to
publicly disclose, in the interest of full and complete transparency, an
itemized accounting of all donations received, and expenses incurred, by
each organization over the past four years subsequent to the 2014
municipal election, up to and including the immediate present and
beyond.

3. Reducing Traffic Congestion in Vancouver
MOVED by Councillor Carr
SECONDED by Councillor Affleck
WHEREAS
1. Traffic congestion in Vancouver is a much-talked subject of public concern;
2. Traffic congestion results in idling vehicles and longer commute times that
contribute to increased greenhouse gas emissions, which reduces our ability to
meet our Greenest City Action Plan goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions;
3. The Independent Commission on Mobility Pricing, which is expected to release
its final report to the Metro Vancouver Mayors’ Council on Transportation and
Translink’s Board of Directors this spring, has been investigating mobility pricing
tools to reduce congestion in Metro Vancouver municipalities;
4. On April 12, 2018, the Lower Mainland Local Government Association (LMLGA)
focused their CivX 2018 workshop for local government officials on developing a
“smart region” that uses technology and data to tackle goals such as reducing
traffic congestion;
5. Vancouver’s Transportation 2040 Plan supports regional road or congestion
pricing (Goal M.4.2) and aims to “optimize network operations to manage
congestion impacts” (Goal M.1.1) however does not include a goal to specifically
reduce traffic congestion.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to develop a Vancouver congestion reduction plan that:
i. Includes measuring greenhouse gas emissions associated with traffic
congestion and sets goals for reducing those emissions;
ii. Synchronizes with the goals and actions of Vancouver’s Transportation
2040 Plan;

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, Tuesday, May 1, 2018 31
iii. Responds to the recommendations arising out of the Metro Vancouver
