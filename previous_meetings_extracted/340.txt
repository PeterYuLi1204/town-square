al-Adha. On behalf of Mayor Sim, they proclaimed that June 28th is Eid al-Adha in the City of

A.2 Addressing Ongoing Inequities by Improving Social Infrastructure and Access to
Services Across South Vancouver and Marpole Neighbourhoods
The Committee heard from 34 speakers who spoke in support of the recommendations.
MOVED by Councillor Boyle
SECONDED by Councillor Carr
WHEREAS
1. South Vancouver is made up of distinct neighbourhoods, including Killarney,
Victoria-Fraserview, and Sunset (Population total: 100,920), bordered by Marpole
(27,852) to the South West. South Vancouver makes up the largest geographical
region of Vancouver as well as the most racially diverse, with many languages
spoken and many residents living in multigenerational homes. According to the
2021 data from Statistics Canada:
• 80% of South Vancouver residents self-identify as visible minorities in
comparison to the City of Vancouver as a whole at 55%, making it one of
the most racialized areas of Vancouver;
• Over half the residents in South Vancouver identify as immigrants (53%
of the catchment’s population);
• South Vancouver has the highest population with a non-English first
language (64% vs 46% in Vancouver overall);
• South Vancouver has a higher average household size than the City
average (2.7 vs. 2.1);
• South Vancouver has a lower median personal income ($35.6k vs. City’s
average of $42k);
• One fifth (20%) of Vancouver’s child and youth population (ages 0-19) live
in South Vancouver;

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, June 28, 2023 8
• 18% of Vancouver’s seniors live in South Vancouver, and 15% of South
Vancouver seniors are low-income;
2. These vibrant neighbourhoods are a draw for families and newcomers, but are
also under-resourced. According to a 2021 study by the South Vancouver
Neighbourhood House (SVNH) and Simon Fraser University (SFU) Urban
Studies and Health Sciences, titled the South Vancouver & Marpole
Neighbourhood Equity Report, South Vancouver and Marpole experience
inequities in various areas, including:
• Social infrastructure grants and funding;
• Mobility, including active transportation and public transit;
• Healthcare services;
• LGBTQ2S+ services;
• Immigrant and newcomer services;
• Childcare services;
• Support for families, youth, seniors, and people with disabilities;
3. In 2021, South Vancouver Neighbourhood House (SVNH) launched the
Reframing South Vancouver Initiative to elevate the historically underrepresented
voices of South Vancouver residents through a series of engagement activities
and the creation of Neighbourhood Advisory Committees. The Reframing South
Vancouver Initiative has engaged over 2000 South Vancouver residents and
stakeholders, and organized or participated in over 50 community engagement
events since the start of the Initiative;
4. Some of the findings of the Reframing South Vancouver Initiative include:
• South Vancouver consists of 3 distinct catchments and 12 micro-
neighbourhoods;
• South Vancouver is experiencing significant social inequities compared to
the City of Vancouver as a whole;
• South Vancouver is diverse in every way and its residents face numerous
barriers to community engagement, such as distrust in authority, fear of
political participation, and limited and high-barrier ways to engage with
the City of Vancouver;
• Strategic approaches are required to engage with South Vancouver
residents, thus a lot of time, person power, resources and flexibility are
needed from staff when conducting engagement sessions;
• The creation of Neighbourhood Advisory Committees is an effective
strategy for capacity-building;
• Working within the hub of South Vancouver Neighbourhood House
(SVNH), Neighbourhood Advisory Committees are now poised to partner
with City of Vancouver staff liaison in order to ensure a level of equity in
resource allocation and service delivery that these neighbourhood houses
have not historically been offered;
5. All of this work requires funding and support to be successful. The Reframing
South Vancouver Initiative received one-time funding in 2021 from Vancouver
Foundation, WES Mariam Assefa Fund, Real Estate Foundation and the BC
provincial government, totaling $559,000. The Initiative also received funding

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, June 28, 2023 9
from SFU’s Community-Engaged Research Initiative (CERI) and in-kind support
from SFU Urban Studies and Health Sciences for community-engaged research
and knowledge sharing;
6. Youth are often disproportionately impacted by social infrastructure inequities
and overlooked in urban planning processes. In 2021, South Vancouver
Neighbourhood House (SVNH) collaborated with Simon Fraser University (SFU)
to launch the Youth.hood study, which engaged 42 racialized youth from across
South Vancouver to identify features of their neighbourhoods that help or hinder
their connectedness, prioritize issues to address, and advocate for
neighbourhood improvement. Results from the study tell a compelling story of the
critical role that social infrastructure plays for youth social connectedness,
cultural identity, and resilience—and how lack of active transportation
infrastructure, poor neighbourhood upkeep, and shortage of quality public spaces
in South Vancouver are major barriers to their social wellbeing;
7. South Vancouver Neighbourhood House (SVNH) has been actively engaging
with representatives from local First Nations and urban Indigenous communities
as well as Indigenous residents in South Vancouver. This aligns with the City’s
commitment to the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous
Peoples and the framework of reconciliation;
8. South Vancouver Neighbourhood House’s (SVNH) homelessness initiative, youth
prevention effort and placemaking projects such as sidewalk improvements,
among others, are all in support of community safety and wellbeing;
9. The Marpole community was included in the South Vancouver & Marpole
Neighbourhood Equity Report, and its statistics were included in the findings. The
Marpole Neighbourhood House is now well positioned to conduct Marpole
specific engagement to identify and address neighbourhood's specific issues and
inequities in the neighbourhood, including:
• Marpole is home to many vulnerable residents including isolated seniors,
families living below the poverty line and a growing number of unhoused
and precariously housed individuals;
• The neighbourhood includes many older three and four storey walk-ups
on the south side of 70th between Cambie and Granville, home to many
long time renters worried about displacement;
• Ongoing development continues to bring thousands of new residents to
the area, increasing the need for secure and affordable housing as well
as more social infrastructure and support;
10. The work and recommendations with Reframing South Vancouver and the South
Vancouver & Marpole Neighbourhood Equity Report align with Vancouver’s
Healthy City Strategy, the Vancouver Food Strategy, Vancouver’s Social
Infrastructure Strategy, as well as additional city strategies and priorities.

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, June 28, 2023 10
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED:
A. THAT Council direct staff to review the work of the Reframing South Vancouver
Initiative, the Neighbourhood Advisory Committees, and Youth.hood participants;
and to use it to inform engagement processes, neighbourhood improvements,
and policy and funding allocation decisions at the City of Vancouver.
B. THAT Council direct staff to work in collaboration with South Vancouver
Neignbourhood House to support the continued work of the Reframing South
Vancouver Initiative and to ensure the voices of residents across South
Vancouver neighbourhoods are heard at City Hall. Including consideration of:
i. Creating a Neighbourhood Action Plan that is action-oriented, resident-
led, supported by City staff, and honours existing community assets;
ii. Ensuring the work is adequately funded, and having South Vancouver
Neighbourhood House (SVNH) and City staff report back to Council on
the progress at least once per year.
C. THAT staff work with Marpole Neighbourhood House and community partners to
initiate similar community engagement work to the Reframing Initiative led by
South Vancouver Neighbourhood House (SVNH).
D. THAT Council direct staff to bring any further recommendations to Council in
future Operating and Capital Budgets to address the historic under resourcing of
neighbourhoods across South Vancouver and Marpole. Including consideration
of:
i. Grants and investments, particularly related to addressing food security
challenges, increasing park and public space amenities for all age groups
and abilities—including water parks, skateboarding parks, public
washrooms, covered area green space, lighting, flowers and gardens,
and quiet spaces to retreat off the main or noisy streets;
ii. Improved coordination of and access to warming and cooling spaces
during extreme weather events;
iii. Opportunities for improved public transit, traffic calming, and safe
pedestrian and active transportation infrastructure;
iv. Neighbourhood specific plans that increase housing options for all
incomes and bring additional neighbourhood amenity funding to the
area.
E. THAT Council request the Mayor write to Provincial and Federal partners
outlining concerns from South Vancouver residents about limited access to
healthcare services, and request consultation with the community about
improved health services, including the scheduled closure of the only Community
Health Clinic in South Vancouver.

A.3 Naming the City’s New Chinatown Office
The committee heard from one speaker who spoke in support of the motion.
MOVED by Mayor Sim
SECONDED by Councillor Zhou
WHEREAS:
1. Chinatown is an invaluable part of our city and an important part of Vancouver’s
cultural identity and heritage;
2. Vancouver City Council remains resolute in its commitment to revitalizing this
historic neighbourhood and to ensuring that it is safe, easy to access, and a
vibrant place for visitors, residents, and businesses alike;
i
3. Vancouver’s Chinatown has long served as a symbol of how Chinese-Canadians
and other minorities overcame hardships and discrimination together, and in the

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, June 28, 2023 17
process, helped make our city a more just society;
4. Work has been underway for several months to establish a satellite City Hall
office in Chinatown a create a formal presence in the community;
5. The imminent opening of the Chinatown satellite City Hall office provides an
opportunity to name this new office in honour of a significant person or place
name. But in order to name a civic facility such as the new Chinatown office, the
name must have Council approval;
6. The City of Vancouver has a Civic Asset Naming Committee, the mandate of
which is to advise Council on matters pertaining to the naming of City-owned
assets, with the exception of assets operated by City of Vancouver Parks and
Recreation, and the Vancouver Public Library;
7. The role of the Civic Asset Naming Committee is to recommend names for
streets and roads, development areas, pedestrian and cycling infrastructure,
City-owned assets and facilities (excluding Parks and Library assets), and to
offer policy advice. The Committee also serves to approve the names that are to
be added to the Civic Asset Name Reserve List based on input from staff
regarding compliance with naming policies and guidelines;
8. Inclusion of a name on the Name Reserve List for City-owned assets should
generally be people who are no longer living, places, events, and things related
to the city of Vancouver;
9. The Civic Asset Name Reserve List contains the names of a number of well-
researched persons of significance who satisfy multiple naming criteria
established by the City;
10. Any person considered for inclusion on the Name Reserve List must demonstrate
exceptional dedication and excellence in service in ways that made a significant
contribution to the community, the city of Vancouver, the province of British
Columbia, or Canada, such as providing extraordinary help or care to individuals,
families, or groups, or risked their life to save or protect others;
11. Likewise, any person to be honoured by inclusion on the Name Reserve List for
City-owned assets should reflect the cultural and ethnic diversity of Vancouver;
12. Won Alexander Cumyow (溫金有) is a person of significance whose name is
included on the City’s Name Reserve List. He is the first person of Chinese
descent born in what is now present-day Canada (British North America), and his
activism and involvement in various organizations left a lasting impact on
Chinese Canadian history. In 2020, he was shortlisted by the Bank of Canada for
the new redesigned five-dollar bill alongside seven other important historical
figures: Francis Pegahmagabow, Fred Loft, Isapo-muxika, Lotta
Hitschmanova, Pitseolak Ashoona, Robertine Barry, and Terry Fox;
13. In addition to being a prominent leader of the Chinese community in Vancouver,
and a founder of the Chinese Empire Reform Association and a president of the
Chinese Benevolent Association, Won Alexander Cumyow (溫金有) was also a
public servant who worked as a court translator. He spoke multiple languages

Minutes, Wednesday, June 28, 2023 18
including Hakka, Cantonese, English, and Chinook Wawa, and by the 1870s,
when his family moved to New Westminster, he was able to complete his
education and training in law. In 1888, using his language skills, he became a
Chinese and Chinook court interpreter for the Vancouver Police Department, a
position he held until his retirement in 1936;
ii
14. In 1947, when voting rights were finally restored for Chinese Canadians, Won
Alexander Cumyow (溫金有) cast his vote in the 1949 federal election at the age
of 88 after years of advocating for voting rights.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT the City Hall satellite office in Chinatown shall
be named in honour of Won Alexander Cumyow (溫金有) in recognition of his significant
contributions and his dedication in service to the community, the city and people of
Vancouver, province of British Columbia, and Canada, and the lasting impact of his
legacy on Chinese Canadian history.

i In January 2023, the Uplifting Chinatown Action Plan was approved by Council with a focus on providing
Chinatown with enhanced cleaning and sanitation services, graffiti removal, beautification, and additional
community supports. Likewise, setting a new flat rate of $2 per hour for parking meters throughout
Chinatown was implemented to introduce consistent parking pricing and to support the City’s efforts to
revitalize the area as part of the Uplifting Chinatown Action Plan.
ii Won Alexander Cumyow (溫金有), activist and interpreter (born around 21 March 1861 in Port Douglas,

“gold have” — was likely a reflection of the Gold Rush period in which he was born.
A.4 B.C. Affordable, Net Zero, Offsite Wood Housing Industrial Development
The committee heard from four speakers who spoke in support of the recommendations.
MOVED by Councillor Dominato
SECONDED by Councillor Carr
WHEREAS
1. The Province and cities throughout British Columbia are focused on expanding
housing supply and affordability, coupled with a strong focus on sustainability
and a value-added economy;
2. B.C. is home to an enterprising, offsite wood frame and mass timber
manufacturing industry distributed province-wide. The industry is more mature
than most North American jurisdictions but needs policy support to survive and
thrive;
3. While B.C. is a North American leader in mass timber and offsite manufacturing,
it still accounts for less than 5% of all new building construction. In Sweden, more
than 80% of single family and 10% of multi-family construction is done off site
and growing;

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, June 28, 2023 19
4. The single greatest barrier to offsite construction expansion is insufficient market
demand from public and private project development;
5. British Columbia has yet to develop a robust strategy to address our shrinking
construction labour force, which is a growing constraint on new housing supply;
6. Offsite construction in high tech manufacturing plants has the potential to deliver
improvements of up to 50% labour productivity, 50% construction time, 20% cost
savings and net zero and low embodied carbon construction;
7. There are hundreds of strategically located public land parcels across B.C. with
underutilized land that can be used to cost effectively build affordable housing
and grow a pipeline of projects to mobilize investment in manufacturing plant
expansion;
8. Collaborative governance is essential to developing a strong policy framework for
offsite wood construction that will help address our pressing housing and climate
challenges.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
THAT the following resolution be submitted to Union of British Columbia Municipalities
(UBCM) for submission as a 2023 Union of British Columbia Municipalities (UBCM)
Resolution, and titled: “B.C. Affordable, Net Zero, Offsite Wood Housing Industrial
Development.”
RESOLUTION
MOTION: B.C. Affordable, Net Zero, Offsite Wood Housing Industrial
Development
WHEREAS B.C. has yet to develop an effective strategy to address one of the
biggest constraints on new housing supply––our shrinking construction labour
force––and offsite wood frame and mass timber construction has potential to
deliver improvements of up to 50% labour productivity, 50% construction time
and 20% cost savings, net zero and low embodied carbon construction and
secure jobs in forest dependent and Indigenous communities;
AND WHEREAS the greatest barrier to expanding offsite construction is
insufficient market demand from public and private project developers unfamiliar
with this novel approach and there are hundreds of strategically located, public
land parcels with underutilized land that can be used to cost effectively build
affordable housing and grow a predictable pipeline of projects to mobilize
investment in manufacturing plant expansion:
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that UBCM calls on the Government of B.C. to
collaborate with diverse sectors to establish a B.C.-based Offsite Wood
Construction Industrial Policy Framework and steadily grow demand and
capacity by working with interested public sector organizations to use offsite
construction to build, permanently affordable, zero carbon housing on
underutilized public land close to jobs and services.

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, June 28, 2023 20
AND BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that UBCM works with the BC Government
to develop an Affordable Housing Offsite Wood Construction Early Adopter
Program with voluntary municipal actions that aggregate demand like pre-
approved designs, zoning and permits for different housing types; and voluntary
actions for other sectors like developers, builders, school boards, health
authorities and forestry companies.

A.5 Tackling BC’s Toxic Drug Health Emergency
The committee heard from five speakers who spoke in support of the recommendations.
MOVED by Councillor Carr
SECONDED by Councillor Dominato
WHEREAS
1. Drug overdose deaths in BC continue unabated and by June 2023 there have
been over 12,000 drug overdose deaths province-wide since the Provincial
Health Officer’s declaration of a Drug Overdose Public Health Emergency in
2016;
2. The current federally-permitted “safe supply” of up to 2.5 grams of heroin,
fentanyl, methamphetamines or MDMA per day is not preventing addicts from
turning to the illegal drug market and there are an inadequate number of
resources including drug testing, overdose prevention sites, and treatment
facilities throughout the province to keep users safe;
3. Where they exist, supervised injection and harm reduction sites have prevented
some deaths, but are now less available because many users are now inhaling
rather than injecting drugs and the provincial Tobacco and Vapour Products
Control Act requires smoke and vapour-free indoor public environments;
4. The continuing insufficient number of detox beds and addiction treatment
facilities result in long wait lists, preventing needed “treatment on demand”;
5. There are not enough available prevention programs, especially for youth.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
THAT the following resolution be submitted to Union of British Columbia Municipalities
(UBCM) as a 2023 Union of British Columbia Municipalities (UBCM) Resolution, and
titled: “Tackling BC’s Toxic Drug Health Emergency”.
RESOLUTION
MOTION: Tackling BC’s Toxic Drug Health Emergency

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, June 28, 2023 21
WHEREAS the continued illegal supply of increasingly toxic street drugs has led
to over 12,000 toxic drug overdose deaths since the BC Provincial Health
Officer’s declaration of a Drug Overdose Public Health Emergency in 2016, and
government measures to date, including the current 3-year federal safe drug
supply pilot programme, have failed to reduce the criminal supply of toxic drugs;
AND WHEREAS there is insufficient province-wide access to resources and
services that would increase users’ safety. Including drug testing and overdose
prevention sites as well as detox beds and treatment services on demand, and
preventative programs, especially for youth, and even current safe injection sites
are now hampered in providing safety since more users are now inhaling rather
than injecting drugs and provincial regulations restrict indoor smoking and
vaping:
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that UBCM urge the BC Government to work
with medical researchers, experts, local service providers, other key stakeholders
and people who use drugs to determine a comprehensive, integrated,
economically and geographically accessible, and evidence-based province-wide
plan to better tackle BC’s toxic drug health emergency, including:
• Increasing safety by:
Rapidly delivering access province-wide to resources and services
o
that will improve users’ and public safety, including drug testing,
supervised consumption spaces and overdose prevention sites;
Quickly amending the Tobacco and Vapour Products Control Act to
o
enable supervised consumption and other harm reduction facilities to
allow inhalation or smoking of drugs where operations can otherwise
be demonstrated as WorkSafe compliant;
Preparing for a review of the current 3-year federal safe drug supply
o
pilot program by determining the most appropriate drugs and amounts
needed for a safer drug supply sufficient to eliminate the need for
users to acquire toxic drugs from the illegal market;
• Increasing economically accessible treatment by supporting the BC
Nurses’ Union 2023 convention resolution to “develop a system of mental
and addiction treatment and recovery services that are regulated,
evidence-based, economically and geographically accessible, and are
available when people are looking for it”;
• Increasing prevention by investing in mental health treatment and life-
enhancing youth, family and community well-being programs, including
early childhood detection, intervention and ongoing supports for learning
differences.

MOVED by Councillor Carr
SECONDED by Councillor Zhou
WHEREAS:
1. On average in British Columbia, we throw away the equivalent of 1 out of every 4
bags of groceries we buy, adding up to more than $1,100 of food from our homes
every year;1
2. The National Zero Waste Council’s 2022 research shows that in Canada as a
whole almost 2.3 million tonnes of edible food is wasted each year, costing
Canadians in excess of $20 billion, and 63% of the food thrown away could have
been eaten;2
3. Over one in 10 BC households (11.8%), representing 485,500 British
Columbians, experience some level of food insecurity. About 3% of households,
representing 91,100 British Columbians, experienced severe food insecurity;3
4. In BC, organic waste currently represents 40% of material sent to our landfills. As
this material decomposes, it generates a significant level of greenhouse gases,
including the potent greenhouse gas methane, which increases global warming
and contributes to climate change. Climate scientists are predicting that
accelerated global warming, with increased droughts, floods, extreme heat and
extreme weather events, will greatly reduce global food-production capacity and
lead to food shortages.4
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
THAT City Council direct staff to forward the following motion to the UBCM for
consideration at its 2023 Annual General Meeting.
Resolution
MOTION: Decreasing Food Waste, Increasing Food Security
WHEREAS over 11.8% of BC households (485,500 British Columbians)
experience some level of food insecurity and about 3% of households (91,100
British Columbians) experience severe food insecurity, leading to more than
163,000 people in BC using a food bank in March of 2022 and the prediction that
reliance on food banks and other food charities is expected to increase by 60
percent in BC in 2023, with the non-profit sector bearing the brunt of costs
associated with collecting and delivering food that would otherwise be wasted to
people in need;

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, June 28, 2023 26
AND WHEREAS the National Zero Waste council calculates that 63 percent of all
of the food Canadians throw away could have been eaten and, according to the
Government of BC, about 40 percent of our produce ends up in a landfill, where it
breaks down to produce significant greenhouse gases which climate scientists
predict will accelerate global warming and greatly reduce food-production
capacity:
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that UBCM urge the BC Government to:
• Measure, monitor and make publicly available data on food waste in BC in
order to inform and develop policies, guidelines and practices to reduce food
waste; and
• Support the non-profit sector involved in rescuing and distributing food as an
essential interim measure to address food insecurity for vulnerable and
equity-seeking populations until more sustainable public interventions
address poverty and income insecurity, the primary drivers of food insecurity
in BC.
AND BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that
• UBCM urge the BC Government to incorporate measures to reduce food
wastage and over-packaging of produce, increase organic waste diversion,
and promote the consumption of planet-friendly foods into its climate plan
(CleanBC).

A.7 Increasing BC Hydro’s Feed-in-Tariff for Renewable Energy Production
The committee heard from one speaker who spoke in support of the recommendations.
MOVED by Councillor Carr
SECONDED by Councillor Fry
WHEREAS
1. Communities throughout British Columbia are facing increasing numbers of
record-breaking extreme weather events, including fires, heat waves, droughts,
floods and storms—the result of Earth's rapidly changing climate (see
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2023 Sixth Assessment
Report Summary for Policymakers;1

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, June 28, 2023 27
2. Climate scientists are imploring every political jurisdiction to ramp up its efforts to
rapidly reduce its GHGs and use of fossil fuels and rapidly increase the
production and use of renewable energy (see: UN climate report: It's 'now or
never' to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees;2 3 4
3. Vancouver City Council passed a motion in January, 2023 to increase the supply
of renewable energy within our city. Distributed energy production provides more
climate resilience, reduces consumers’ ongoing energy bills and stimulates local
economies. Jurisdictions such as Ontario, for example, provided deep subsidies
through high feed-in tariffs to stimulate production of solar energy and local
industrial development;
4. In order to stimulate the needed shift to clean renewable energy other
jurisdictions, such as Norway, heavily incentivize local municipal and household
renewable energy production with preferential pricing plus deep subsidies for
batteries and converters which create deep climate resilience;
5. On June 15, 2023 the BC Government announced that BC Hydro, in spring 2024,
will launch a call for new sources of renewable, emission-free electricity in BC.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
THAT City Council direct staff to forward the following motion to the UBCM for
consideration at its 2023 Annual General Meeting.
Resolution
MOTION: Increasing BC Hydro’s Feed-in-Tariff for Renewable Energy
Production
WHEREAS British Columbia’s new BC Zero Carbon Step Code (effective May 1,
2023) and Clean BC Roadmap to 2030 will accelerate the uptake of electric
vehicles, heat pumps and other technologies that will increase the demand for
clean electricity. However, B.C. Hydro's Five-Year Electrification Plan, released
by the government in September of 2021, estimates that it has sufficient supply
of clean electricity, including from Site C dam, only to 2030, leading government
to announce plans to call for new utility-scale sources of renewable, emission-
free electricity in BC;
AND WHEREAS the BC Government in the past has incentivized the
development of clean renewable energy through advantageous feed-in tariffs,
such as for Independent Hydro-Electric Power Producers:
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that UBCM urge the BC Government to require
that BC Hydro increase feed-in tariffs for the municipal, First Nations and private
production of renewable energy, including solar, wind, geothermal energy,
sufficient to stimulate the increased investment and production at all scales—
including household and municipal—needed to tackle the climate emergency.

through high feed-in tariffs to stimulate production of solar energy and local
industrial development;
4. In order to stimulate the needed shift to clean renewable energy other
jurisdictions, such as Norway, heavily incentivize local municipal and household
renewable energy production with preferential pricing plus deep subsidies for
batteries and converters which create deep climate resilience;
5. On June 15, 2023 the BC Government announced that BC Hydro, in spring 2024,
will launch a call for new sources of renewable, emission-free electricity in BC.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, June 28, 2023 29
THAT City Council direct staff to forward the following motion to the UBCM for
consideration at its 2023 Annual General Meeting.
Resolution
MOTION: Increasing BC Hydro’s Pricing for Renewable Energy Production
WHEREAS British Columbia’s new BC Zero Carbon Step Code (effective May 1,
2023) and Clean BC Roadmap to 2030 will accelerate the uptake of electric
vehicles, heat pumps and other technologies that will increase the demand for
clean electricity. However, B.C. Hydro's Five-Year Electrification Plan, released
by the government in September of 2021, estimates that it has sufficient supply
of clean electricity, including from Site C dam, only to 2030, leading government
to announce plans to call for new utility-scale sources of renewable, emission-
free electricity in BC;
AND WHEREAS the BC Government in the past has incentivized the
development of clean renewable energy through advantageous feed-in tariffs,
such as for Independent Hydro-Electric Power Producers:
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that UBCM urge the BC Government to require
that BC Hydro increase the price they will pay for the municipal, First Nations and
private production of renewable energy, including solar, wind, geothermal
energy, sufficient to stimulate the increased investment and production at all
scales—including household and municipal—needed to tackle the climate
emergency, while also ensuring reasonable energy affordability and that natural
environments are protected.

A.8 A New Fiscal Framework for Sustainable and Predictable Local Government
Funding
MOVED by Councillor Dominato
SECONDED by Councillor Carr
WHEREAS
1. Local governments and their representative organizations, the Federation of
Canadian Municipalities (FCM) and Union of BC Municipalities (UBCM), have
noted for over a decade that the current municipal funding model and
overreliance on property taxes are neither sustainable nor resilient;

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, June 28, 2023 30
2. The role of local governments has evolved significantly in recent decades, with
municipalities taking on new responsibilities with respect to health and social
services, housing and economic development, as well as maintaining
longstanding responsibilities for policing, waste management, and water and
wastewater services, all of which are becoming more complex due to societal
issues such as mental health, homelessness, and climate change;
3. Municipalities are constrained in their ability to generate revenue to fund their
capital and operating expenses, and property taxes are increasingly seen to be
an inadequate and unsustainable tool for Canadian municipalities to support
essential services, maintain critical infrastructure, accommodate growing
populations, and contribute to economic growth;
i
4. The COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted the fragility of the current local
government funding model / framework and shown it to be fundamentally
misaligned with the modern reality of the role of local governments. For example,
economic activities such as e-commerce and the sharing economy have
emerged that rely less and less on the bricks-and-mortar businesses on which
property taxes are based;
ii
5. The downloading of responsibilities to local governments has left many local
governments in BC and across Canada increasingly reliant on granting systems
to provide services, facilities, and infrastructure. This approach is neither reliable
in the long term nor equitable for smaller local governments due to the staff
resources they have available;
6. The role of 21st century cities requires us to be responsive to the more complex
and challenging issues we face, from social issues to climate change impacts;
7. The Federation of Canadian municipalities (FCM) recently passed a resolution at
its 2023 Annual General Meeting calling for a modernized fiscal framework for
municipalities, including the development of a new municipal growth framework
that would result in municipal financial capacity being more accurately linked to
items such as national population growth, inflation, economic growth, and the
role of Canadian municipalities in the 21st century;
8. In 2022, a Memorandum of Understanding on Local Government Financial
Resiliency (MOU) was signed between Union of BC Municipalities (UBCM) and
the Ministries of Finance and Municipal Affairs, establishing a joint provincial-
Union of BC Municipalities (UBCM) Local Government Financial Review Working
Group, focused on addressing the 20 recommendations within the 2021 UBCM
Ensuring Local Government Financial Resiliency Report, which builds off an
earlier 2013 report about strengthening BC local governments’ finance systems;
9. In 2020, the Union of BC Municipalities (UBCM) membership endorsed a request
for the Government of BC to dedicate the equivalent of 1% of the PST annually
to local governments as an appropriate funding source to address the need for a
new local government funding framework that is sustainable, predictable, and
reliable to enable local governments to deliver on their expanded mandates;
10. On October 30, 2019, representatives of the Government of Quebec, the Quebec
Federation of Municipalities (FQM), the Union of Quebec Municipalities (UMQ),

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, June 28, 2023 31
the City of Montreal, and the City of Quebec endorsed an innovative agreement
and funding formula (2020-2024 Partnership: Building Even Stronger
Municipalities and Regions) whereby the Province would transfer to
municipalities the amount corresponding to the growth in revenues it derives from
one point of sales tax [QST];
11. Municipalities are critical to solving national policy challenges and political
priorities such as housing affordability, homelessness, mental health, and the
opioid and addiction crisis, adapting to climate change, reducing Greenhouse
gas (GHG) emissions, economic development, and, ultimately, achieving a high
quality of life for Canadians;
12. The resolutions endorsed by Federation of Canadian municipalities (FCM) and
Union of BC Municipalities (UBCM) memberships respectively reinforce the need
to work collaboratively with the Provincial and Federal governments to establish
predictable revenue sharing arrangements to meet the needs of cities large and
small.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
THAT the following resolution be submitted to Union of BC Municipalities (UBCM) for
submission as a 2023 Union of BC Municipalities (UBCM) Resolution, entitled: “A New
Fiscal Framework for Sustainable and Predictable Local Government Funding”.
RESOLUTION
MOTION: A New Fiscal Framework for Sustainable and Predictable Local
Government Funding
WHEREAS local governments and their representative organizations, the
Federation of Canadian Municipalities (FCM) and Union of BC Municipalities
(UBCM), have noted for over a decade that the current municipal funding model
and overreliance on property taxes are neither sustainable nor resilient;
AND WHEREAS, the Province and Union of BC Municipalities (UBCM) have
recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding on Local Government
Financial Resiliency, establishing a joint provincial-UBCM Local Government
Financial Review Working Group, focused on addressing the 20
recommendations within the 2021 UBCM Ensuring Local Government Financial
Resiliency Report:
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that the Union of BC Municipalities (UBCM)
request that the joint provincial-UBCM Local Government Financial Review
Working Group explore developing a multiyear funding framework for local
governments similar to Quebec’s 2020-2024 Partnership: Building Even Stronger
Municipalities and Regions framework whereby the Province would transfer an
amount corresponding to the growth in revenues it derives from one point of the
provincial sales tax (PST) to local governments as a sustainable, predictable,
and reliable source of funding.
