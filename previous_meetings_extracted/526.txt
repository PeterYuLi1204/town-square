13 Licence By-Law No. 4450, section 25.1
Robert LeBlanc, City Prosecutor, was present on behalf of the City of Vancouver. Ryan
MacMillan, the Licencee, was present on his own behalf.
Mr. LeBlanc provided opening remarks, reviewed relevant legislation as set out in sections 275
and 277 of the Vancouver Charter, and section 25.1(3) of Licence By-law No. 4450, to consider
the suspension of the Short Term Rental Business license issued to Ryan MacMillan and
Myleen MacMillan, the Licencees.
In support of the allegations set out in the evidence brief, Mr. LeBlanc called Koji Miyaji,
Assistant Director, Community Standards, Development, Buildings and Licencing, as a witness.
Mr. LeBlanc, along with Panel members, directed questions to Mr. Miyaji who, for clarity,
provided reasons why the Licencees would no longer qualify for a business licence. Mr. Miyaji
explained that the Chief Licence Inspector has determined that Unit #2 of the premises is not
the principal residence of the Licencees and has therefore suspended the Business Licence.
Ryan MacMillan, the Licencee, also directed questions to Mr. Miyaji.
The Licencee provided opening remarks and reviewed the reasons for starting a short-term
rental.
In response to questions from Mr. LeBlanc and Panel members, the Licencee advised that he
sent the additional documentation requested by staff to the Short-Term Rental Office email
address and agreed to submit the additional documentation to the Panel.
