MOVED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. The COVID-19 pandemic has inflicted significant negative economic impacts with
many Vancouver businesses including restaurants, tourism businesses, hotels,
and personal-care services such as hair stylists, nail salons and dentists, forced
to close or severely limit operations due to health and physical distancing
restrictions;
2. Restaurants have been one of the most immediate and hardest hit sectors, and
small business operators are struggling to survive with many limited to takeout
offerings and attempting to make it through the pandemic;
3. Small businesses like restaurants are vital to the fabric and character of
Vancouver neighbourhoods and support complete communities;

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, May 13, 2020 3
4. Small businesses like restaurants are key contributors to Vancouver’s economic
health generating jobs and tax revenue;
5. The City has a key role to play in supporting economic recovery. Speed flexibility
and nimbleness in permitting and business support services will be instrumental
to helping businesses get back up and running and survive;
6. Patio season is a critical revenue generator for restaurants and is upon us now.
Expedited patio permitting must be turnkey when restaurants are able to reopen
to table type service;
7. Some work has begun with staff offering online renewals for patio permits during
the COVID-19 crisis;
8. An outcome of COVID will likely be the need for some continued physical
distancing processes in businesses. Customers will also be cautious about being
in close quarters to others;
9. Patios provide the health benefit of fresh air and sunlight;
10. There is opportunity to be innovative and redefine patios such as pop-up
standing patios for quick service type offerings, expanded size to enable physical
distancing, or utilization of curb lane, street, sidewalk and laneway space for
extensions where it doesn’t impede accessibility, transit, emergency vehicles or
traffic;
11. Currently, patio permitting can require a combination of licensing, development
permits and permits to enable operations;
12. Currently, craft breweries are not permitted to have patio operations in
Vancouver;
13. The City of Vancouver has initiated a street reallocation response that focuses on
Room to Queue, Room to Load, and Room to Move during the COVID-19
pandemic. There is opportunity to add Room to Eat to this work, and to
re-examine public space use as part of a new post-pandemic world; and
14. Many cities are re-examining the use of public space now to achieve healthier
communities. A COVID legacy can be a more vibrant and people focused public
realm.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to prepare options and report back as soon as possible
to support more flexible patio types (including consideration for pre-detailed
designs and formats), utilization of curb lane, street, sidewalk and laneway space
for extensions, expedited permitting including applications and renewals, as well
as the number of patios allowed, in order to support the economic recovery and
safe operations of Vancouver’s restaurant sector in the context of COVID-19.

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, May 13, 2020 4
B. THAT such options outlined in A above identify any needed amendments to
Street Vending By-law No. 10868 and the Street and Traffic By-law No. 2849 to
enable greater flexibility.
C. THAT breweries that currently hold a lounge endorsement within the City of
Vancouver may apply for patio endorsements, aligning with the
recommendations and guidelines set out by the Provincial government, and that
brewery patio applications will be considered as long as the total patron load
including the new patio remains below the current City patron limit for ancillary
brewery lounges. Considerations for brewery lounge patios should adhere to
similar licensing and permitting fees as restaurants and cafes.
D. THAT such options be considered for the duration of the COVID-19 response
and recovery, recognizing that innovation will provide for valuable learning
towards operations and adaptation in a new, post-COVID world;
FURTHER THAT staff report back on possible opportunities to create
common-style eating spaces with additional chairs, benches or tables on public
plazas or public spaces, that can enable outdoor eating areas to support different
takeout or quick service restaurants and cafes in various neighbourhoods and
commercial districts, with consultation with impacted business improvement
associations as may be appropriate (recognizing previous Council motions such
as Celebrating Italian Culture: Welcome Signage in Little Italy and a Pilot
Program for an Italian Piazza in Vancouver as it relates to Commercial Drive).
E. THAT this motion be shared with the Council Pandemic Response and Recovery
Working Group for the purpose of enabling them to seek or share further
information from the restaurant sector as may be beneficial to and aid this work.

3. Working for More Housing Affordability in the Cambie Corridor
At the Council meeting on May 12, 2020, Council referred the following motion to the Standing
Committee on City Finance and Services meeting on May 13, 2020, in order to hear from
speakers.
The Committee heard from one speaker in support.
MOVED by Councillor Swanson
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. The public benefits summary for the rezoning application at 4989 Ash Street
points out that a total of 10,740 housing units are complete, under construction,
approved or in review in the Cambie Corridor;
2. The summary shows that 71% are condos serving households with incomes
mostly over $100K per year;
3. The summary shows that 20% are purpose built rental serving households with
incomes mostly over $60K per year;
4. The summary shows that 9% or 947 units are social housing;
5. Of the 947 units that are social housing, only 30% or 284 units have to be at
HILS (about $50-80K/year);
6. That means only 3% of the total number of units have to be at HILS even though
50% of renters and 26% of owners in Vancouver have incomes below HILs;
7. The Cambie Corridor Plan says (p. 21) that one purpose of the plan is to “ensure
that objectives for affordable housing meet the needs of households with low
incomes, seniors, and those with mental illnesses and addictions.”; and

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, May 13, 2020 11
8. The housing mix that is playing out in the Corridor is skewed toward people who
have more than average income and is excluding low wage workers, seniors,
people with low incomes, people with disabilities and people who are homeless.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council ask staff to revisit and report back as
part of their ongoing work on the affordability of Cambie Corridor Plan housing and
public benefit targets, taking into account that the new units that are built, under
construction, approved or under review, will not meet the Plan’s goals for affordability, as
only 3% of them are required to be at HILS rates (approximately $50-80K), while half of
renter households in the city as well as 26% of owner households have incomes below
$50K, and make recommendations for aligning the affordability targets to the real
incomes of people in Vancouver who need housing including low wage workers, people
who have low incomes, seniors, people with disabilities and people who are homeless.

physical exercise and safe distancing during the pandemic;
5. Cities across Canada and around the world are undertaking measures to
reallocate street space and roadways for pedestrians to safely exercise, access
businesses and employment, while maintaining a safe distance due to the
current pandemic;

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services

and one lane along Beach Avenue to enable safe physical distancing during the
COVID19 pandemic;
8. The City of Vancouver has initiated a street reallocation initiative that focuses on
Room to Queue, Room to Load, and Room to Move during the COVID-19
pandemic; and
9. The ongoing pandemic necessitates that the City reallocate road space on an
urgent basis now and develop plans for mobility and space use as part of our
post-COVID-19 recovery and new economy.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to expedite efforts to identify
and implement appropriate reallocations of road space, such as high use greenways and
streets adjacent to parks where space could be reallocated temporarily to enable safe
shared use (pedestrians, cyclists, motor vehicles) and support safe physical distancing
during the COVID-19 pandemic response;
FURTHER THAT Council direct staff to communicate information to the public and
businesses regarding the suite of street measures available to the City for reallocating
space to support access to local businesses, to support loading and curbside pick-up,
and to support physical activity and distancing in neighbourhoods across the city;
