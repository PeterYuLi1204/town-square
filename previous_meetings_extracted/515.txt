MOVED by Councillor Swanson
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. A progressive tax imposes a lower tax rate on people who are less able to pay
and a higher rate on those who are most able to pay;
2. British Columbia’s provincial income tax is progressive: designated by income
those with a higher income;
3. Canada’s federal income tax is progressive, as it is determined by income
bracket, with lower income-earners paying a smaller percentage of their earnings
than higher income earners;
4. British Columbia introduced an additional school tax in 2018 that is a progressive
property tax. Properties valued under $3 million do not pay this tax; valuations
between $3 million and $4 million pay 0.2% tax and those valued at $4 million
and above pay a 0.4% tax;
5. Vancouver’s city property tax is currently regressive, as it imposes the same rate
on all properties regardless of the assessed value;
6. Vancouver needs a fair way to raise additional funds that does not put an undue
burden on most people but can raise the money from those with enough wealth
to be able to pay for needed public services, combat climate change, reduce
homelessness, support affordable housing;

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, April 13, 2022 9
7. A recent staff report to Vancouver City Council itemized over $200M in costs
downloaded on the city by provincial and federal governments
https://vancouver.ca/files/cov/12-03-2021-council-memo-city-funds-allocated-to-
downloaded-services.pdf;
8. The 2016 Statistics Canada Financial Security Survey shows that share of land
wealth and total net worth in BC increase together, with the richest households
holding by far the most land wealth and the poorest households holding the least.
Progressive property taxation, rather than a flat rate taxation, would reduce
wealth inequality https://www.policynote.ca/land-wealth-is-a-massive-source-of-
inequality-in-bc/;
9. A provincial program provides a low income grant supplement for senior home
owners earning less than $32,000 a year
https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/taxes/property-taxes/annual-property-
tax/home-owner-grant/senior/low-income;
10. BC homeowners who are 55 years or older, a surviving spouse, or eligible
persons with disabilities can also apply to defer their property taxes. Deferment is
also available for homeowners who financially support a dependent child.
https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2018FIN0023-000951;
11. Extra money from a progressive tax could be used to build housing and reduce
homelessness; and
12. For example, if there were an additional surtax of 1% on the value of residential
properties assessed at over $5 million and 2% on the value over $10 million, the
City could have collected approximately $225,000,000 from 4,806 properties in
2021; Modular housing costs approximately $300,000-$500,000 per 320 square
foot unit which would mean 450-750 new homes could be built per year.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council request the Mayor, on behalf of City Council, to urge the Province
to amend the Vancouver Charter to permit Council to impose different rates of
property tax based on the value of the property.
B. THAT Council direct staff to investigate options for the legal and financial
structure of a Vancouver progressive property tax and how it could help to end
homelessness, and report back by Q4 2022.

8. Lock It or Lose It: Improving Secure Bike Infrastructure in the City of Vancouver
(Previously Motion B5)
At the Council meeting on April 12, 2022, Council referred this item to the Standing Committee
on Policy and Strategic Priorities meeting on April 13, 2022, in order to hear from speakers,
followed by debate and decision.
The Committee heard from four speakers in support of the recommendations.
MOVED by Councillor Fry
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. Cycling can be an inexpensive, healthy and convenient form of transportation;
2. Vancouver is a cycling city with 10% of trips to work or school and 6% of
shopping trips made by bicycle.1 With a BikeScore of 79, and a network of slowed
street and separated cycling routes, Vancouver is referred to as the second most
bike friendly city in Canada;
3. As part of Vancouver’s Climate Emergency Action Plan, the city has target of 2/3
of all trips by walk/bike/transit by 2030;
4. Safe and secure end-of-trip cycling infrastructure like bike racks, storage lockers,
and bike parking encourage and facilitate more trips by bike;
5. Vancouver has the most bike thefts per capita of any Canadian City. In 2020,
2,115 bicycles were stolen, although police say more thefts were never reported;2

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, April 13, 2022 11
The Vancouver Police Department’s anti-theft and bike identification and
registration program 529 Garage3 advises target hardening through secure locks
and locations to make bike theft more difficult: “Your bike is only as secure as
what you’re locking it to. Make sure thieves can’t lift your bike over the object or
detach the object from the ground to take your bike. Shake the object first to
check it's bolted or cemented. Avoid locking your bike to handrails or other
mobility aids”;
6. According to the City’s current Open Data stats (currently out of date and under
review) there are approximately only 2,422 public bike racks variously installed
on City property, and including street use permit locations issued to commercial
tenants, Business Improvement Associations (BIA), building owners and
development companies, etc.;
7. The deficit of secure bike parking represents a barrier to making trips by bike and
a hardship for anyone who has had their bicycle stolen or stripped;
In a 2009 report 4, the Vancouver Public Space Network warned that there is not
enough bicycle parking to meet current demand. The report further highlighted a
lack of space in existing racks or distance of racks from cyclists’ destinations as
barriers to increasing trips by bike. The report further notes:
a. Lack of infrastructure also results in increased bicycle theft, presents
hazards to pedestrians, and damages city property;
b. Existing bicycle parking infrastructure is inadequate in terms of design,
placement, and maintenance; and
c. Parking Meters are likely to be phased out in the City, further reducing the
number of secure locations for bicycle parking in commercial areas;
8. Parking meters have served as ubiquitous and useful ad hoc cycling
infrastructure in the form of a durable street furniture that is usually well located
and in clear view of shopping and community destinations high traffic commercial
districts and businesses. However:
a. With the 2021 approved replacement of parking meters with digital
parking stations, approximately 5,500 parking meters city-wide are
scheduled to be removed by end of 2023. This means the loss of
hundreds of secure bike lockups to Vancouverites who chose to shop,
work, and play in our city by bike;
b. The city anticipates retrofitting only 2,000 of the parking meter posts with
ring racks over the next three years;
c. The old meterheads and posts have no use beyond bike parking. Their
parts are recycled or donated to other municipalities; 5
d. By design, the replacement of parking meters with connected pay stations
anticipates an increase in generation of street parking revenue; and

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, April 13, 2022 12
e. The actual and projected removal of parking meters represents a
significant loss of necessary bike parking infrastructure;
9. The City of Vancouver lacks a comprehensive bike rack strategy that identifies
quantities, locations, convenience, safety, best practices, and design guidelines
for installing secure bike locking infrastructure. As per the Transportation
Demand Management Action Plan for 2021-2025, a bicycle parking strategy will
not be completed until the end of 2023;6 and
10. The lack of and ongoing loss of secure locking infrastructure for cyclists
compromises the City’s ability to meet goals of encouraging more Vancouverites
to make more trips by bike.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council affirms that secure end-of-trip bike locking infrastructure are
essential to meeting City of Vancouver goals pertaining to active transportation
and Climate Action; and without intervention, the City will experience a net loss of
secure end-of-trip bike locking infrastructure with the planned removal of parking
meters city-wide.
B. THAT Council direct staff to prepare an inventory of current public locking
infrastructure, and needs to meet projected demands of our 2030 CEAP goals;
FURTHER THAT the inventory includes existing and at-risk ad-hoc public bike
locking infrastructure like parking meters, and this information is reported back to
Council as soon as possible before the scheduled removal of city-wide parking
meters.
C. THAT Council direct staff to expedite a secure bike parking strategy that includes
best practices that considers:
a. Safety and pedestrian comfort;
b. Locations relative to destinations;
c. Locations relative to major transit infrastructure and stations;
d. Locations based on needs and frequency of shopping and activities;
e. Locations that promote ease of use and shelter from elements;
f. Security from theft, target hardening, and crime prevention through
environmental design;
g. Typologies for individual and high capacity parking including but not
limited to rings, racks, bike corrals, and parkades;
h. Input from local BIAs, cycling, active transportation, and accessibility and
disability advocates; and
i. Support for bike parking infrastructure through reallocating a small portion
of the considerable street parking revenue that otherwise flows into
general revenue, based on historic dividends and projected new financial
performance efficiencies that will achieved through parking meter
replacement.

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, April 13, 2022 13
D. THAT Council request the Director of Engineering develop a more expeditious
and robust plan for replacing or retrofitting parking meters with secure cycling
lockup infrastructure, including but not limited to:
a. appropriately disabling or covering defunct meters to indicate their
function is not for paying parking charges, yet allowing them to continue
functioning as ad-hoc secure bike locking infrastructure; and/or
b. More closely matching the two year schedule for meter removal with the
three year schedule for meter bike locking ring retrofits;
FURTHER THAT Local BIAs as applicable are engaged to identify, encourage,
and support installation of secure bike locking infrastructure where parking
meters as ad-hoc securing bike locking infrastructure are removed.

AMENDMENT TO THE AMENDMENT MOVED by Councillor Swanson
THAT B be struck and the following be inserted:
B. THAT Council direct staff to work together with groups representing low income
folks and business in Chinatown to recommend creative and community-led
ways of dealing with anti-Asian hate, theft and graffiti, and report back on
recommended mitigation measures before July 2022.
LOST (Vote No. 8278)
(Councillors Bligh, Carr, De Genova, Dominato, Fry, Hardwick, Kirby-Yung and Wiebe opposed)
AMENDMENT TO THE AMENDMENT MOVED by Councillor Swanson
THAT the following be added as F:
F. THAT Council ask staff to investigate and report back on the following
suggestions from the Bagua Artist Association:
1. Pay more artists to create and maintain public artworks in Chinatown and
the Downtown Eastside;
2. Provide designated spaces and platforms for creative expression and
outlet for the graffiti community;
3. Promote and foster new cultural connections and conversations between
the mural artists and graffiti community in Chinatown and the Downtown
Eastside to discuss how they can collaboratively protect the public
artworks and cultural assets. Both mural artists and the graffiti community
have networks, and linking the networks is more valuable and effective
towards the goal than to create more disparity by placing the VPD
between them; and
4. Create a “Chinese Heritage Landmark” Project that catalogs and registers
the significant community murals and public art pieces. Allocate funds for
capable organizations to conduct periodic review, archive, and publish
new art commissions, along with support and maintenance of existing
public artworks and murals. The public artworks in catalog can help
Chinatown become tourist destinations, while policing and CCTV cannot.
