and Heritage Designation of the Ryerson Dunbar United Church
On October 17, 2017, Vancouver City Council heard from speakers at a Public Hearing on the
above-noted application and, following the close of the receipt of public comments, referred
discussion and decision to the Regular Council meeting on October 31, 2017, as Unfinished
Business.
At 11:47 am, Councillor Stevenson left the Council Chamber as he had previously declared a
conflict of interest at the Public Hearing on October 17, 2017, due to a close family member’s
previous association with Ryerson United Church. He did not return until the beginning of the
next item.
Councillors Bremner and De Genova advised they had reviewed the proceedings of the Public
Hearing they had missed and would therefore be participating in discussion and decision on
the application.
Council had before it a Memorandum dated October 16, 2017, from the Assistant Director of
Planning, Vancouver South, advising that since referral to Public Hearing, staff had
determined that the following corrections were required:
• corrections to the proposed parking by-law amendments for both the East Site
(2165-2195 West 45th Avenue) and West Site (2205-2291 West 45th Avenue); and
• additional conditions to facilitate the potential relocation and/or salvage of the
existing character houses on both the East Site (2165-2195 West 45th Avenue) and
West Site (2205-2291 West 45th Avenue).

emphasize a break in the massing between the two components.

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, Tuesday, October 31, 2017 18
Note to Applicant: The addition may maintain the proposed
sloped roof to align with the church. The atrium roof should be
lower to further articulate the break between the two
components and avoid the reading of a single continuous roof
form over both components.
2. Design development to the architectural expression to provide
distinction between the two massing components and ensure the
prominence of the retained church.
Note to Applicant: Further refinement to the architectural
design, composition, exterior finishes and detailing, should
emphasize the contemporary character of the addition, as
distinct from the historical character of the retained church.
3. Provide high quality and durable exterior finishes consistent with
the rezoning application.
Note to Applicant: The intent is to maintain the proposed quality
in all aspects, including but not limited to appearance,
durability, and performance. The use of stone to be consistent
with the church is encouraged.
4. Design development to improve the livability of north-facing
studio units by increasing the amount of windows.
Note to Applicant: Windows should be provided in addition to
glass sliding doors shown.
5. Design development to reduce the prominence of mechanical
projections above the roof line.
Note to Applicant: Mechanical projections to comply with
permitted exclusions from height under Section 10.11 of the
Zoning and Development By-law.
6. Design development to relocate the Pad-Mounted Transformer to
less prominent location along the lane, if possible.
Note to Applicant: The PMT should be screened from view from
the sidewalk, and may be located at the rear of the site between
the church and the addition.
7. The proposed unit mix, including 13 studio units (40.5%),
13 one-bedroom units (40.5%), and 6 two-bedroom units (19%)
for the Social Housing on the West Site, is to be included in the

Director of Planning or Development Permit Board provided that
it does not go lower than 18.75% of the dwelling units designed
to be suitable for families with children.
8. Family units design to meet the High-Density Housing for
Families with Children Guidelines.
Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED)
9. Design development to respond to CPTED principles, having
particular regards for:
(i) residential break and enter;
(ii) mail theft; and
(iii) mischief in alcoves and vandalism, such as graffiti.
Sustainability
10. Provision of a deconstruction plan for demolition to divert at
least 90% (by weight) of demolition waste (excluding
materials banned from disposal) from the landfill.
Note to Applicant: The deconstruction plan should be provided
at the time of development permit application. Plan must be
specific about materials that are being diverted. A template plan

Landscape Review
12. Design development to the West Site on the east side of the
expanded church porch, to respect the single family residential
scale.
Note to Applicant: This could be achieved by breaking up the
extent of the porch east of the main entry and gathering space,
by the addition of some trees and soft landscape, which relates
to the front yards across the street on 45th Avenue.
13. Design development to provide a more conservative tree removal
strategy by the additional retention of Trees #3571 and #3572.

streets. These activities require management by the church or
representative to mitigate negative impacts on neighbours.
Along with the transportation management plan the church
should identify a neighbourhood liaison (i.e. webpage contact)
that is available for follow up and feedback for residents. The
transportation management plan would be posted on the church
webpage and is intended to provide a commitment to neighbours
regarding ongoing management of impacts related to events
hosted at the church facilities.
25. The owner or representative is advised to contact Engineering to
acquire the project’s permissible street use. Prepare a
mitigation plan to minimize street use during excavation and
construction (i.e. consideration to the building design or sourcing
