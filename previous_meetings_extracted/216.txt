not put
* * * * *
Prior to discussion on the amendment, Councillor Kirby-Yung rose on a point of order noting
that Councillor Boyle’s amendment should not be considered as Councillor Klassen noted he
wanted to call the vote prior to Councillor Boyle being given the floor. Following a brief recess,
the Mayor advised that Councillor Boyle’s amendment would be considered, as she currently
has the floor.
Councillor Klassen then rose on a point of order inquiring the reason why the vote was not
called when he had requested it after moving the main motion. The City Clerk advised that
under section 11.5 of the Procedure By-law a Council member must move and another Council
member must second a motion to take the vote on a motion under debate and it requires a 2/3
vote of all Council present. In the case of the main motion being considered, it was moved and
seconded, however, an additional motion to call the vote was not put on the floor and seconded.
Councillor Kirby-Yung then rose on another point of order asking why the Clerks did not guide
the Councillor through the process of calling the vote. Following a brief recess, the Mayor
advised that his decision was to continue with the amendment on the floor, and should
Councillor Kirby-Yung disagree, she could challenge the ruling.
* * * * *
Following the decision of the Mayor, Councillor Kirby-Yung challenged the ruling of the Chair.

ENQUIRIES AND OTHER MATTERS
1. Vancouver Police Department Budget Allocations
Councillor Fry enquired about the intent of the recent budget allocations the City made for the
alcohol on beaches pilot. The City Manager advised it was to provide a more proactive police
presence on beaches and was not necessarily for emergency response.
Councillor Fry also enquired about the Vancouver Police Department’s (VPD) paid overtime for
work on the decampment of Hastings Street. Councillor Fry noted VPD staff are working with
City Finance staff to have it fully funded and asked how that would affect the City’s budget. The
City Manager advised the City’s Finance team is in touch with the VPD about their general
budget, and noted that there is a cost associated with this work, and staff will continue to work
with VPD on their budget. The City Manager also noted that other City staff working on the
decampment of Hastings Street would not incur any significant overtime as departments are
balancing within their resources. The City Manager agreed to follow up with the VPD in order to
provide a more detailed response.
2. Sanitation and Services in the Downtown Eastside
Councillor Bligh noted the current warmer temperatures and enquired about the general
approach to sanitation and services in the Downtown Eastside to ensure streets and alleys stay
as clean as possible. The City Manager advised that a significant amount of the Engineering
budget is allocated to the Downtown Eastside and is a part of the City’s routine budgeted work
on sanitation. The City Manager noted that Engineering staff would provide a response, and it
would include information on the City’s engagement of unhoused residents regarding the
flushing of streets and lanes at night.
