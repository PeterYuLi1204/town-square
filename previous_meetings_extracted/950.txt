5. Support for Adequate Funding for Legal Aid
On April 2, 2019, Vancouver City Council referred this matter to the Standing Committee on
Policy and Strategic Priorities meeting on April 3, 2019, in order to hear from speakers.

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, April 3, 2019 8
The Committee heard from two speakers in support of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Swanson
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. Legal aid is an essential service which provides people who are marginalized,
vulnerable and poor with access to justice;
2. Legal Aid has been chronically underfunded for over 25 years; rates haven’t
increased since 2006 and BC ranks 10 out of the 12 provinces and territories in
per-capita legal aid funding;
3. This underfunding has made it very difficult for the marginalized, vulnerable and
poor to get legal assistance from a lawyer;
4. Many studies and reports, including those commissioned by Government, have
noted the serious consequences for society by the continued chronic
underfunding of Legal Aid;
5. While both men and women have been negatively impacted by the cuts, services
that were most accessed by women, such as family law and poverty law, were
cut the deepest; without proper legal representation, they are losing custody of
their children, giving up valid legal rights to support, and being subjected to
harassment through the courts;
6. Underfunding legal aid is bad fiscal policy. Existing research shows that
increased funding for legal assistance programs actually saves money, by
making the system more efficient and reducing the burden of health care, mental
health and social welfare costs;
7. Access and rights to justice are fundamental to Reconciliation efforts, recognizing
that Indigenous persons are disproportionately over represented in the justice
system;
8. The Association of Legal Aid Lawyers has been attempting to negotiate
appropriate levels of funding for Legal Aid;
9. Over 590 members of the Association of Legal Aid Lawyers voted
overwhelmingly (97%) to withdraw services on April 1, 2019, to protest the
intolerable levels of funding.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT the City of Vancouver recognizes that legal aid is an essential public
service that provides legal representation to the most vulnerable, marginalized
and impoverished members of our city and that the chronic underfunding of legal
aid has led to a serious inequality in the delivery of legal services in our
communities.

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, April 3, 2019 9
B. THAT the City of Vancouver believes that lack of legal aid funding is
unacceptable in a province as rich as ours. Many British Columbians face loss of
liberty, homelessness or lose custody of their children when they do not have
access to representation.
C. THAT the City of Vancouver believes the current system puts vulnerable people
– mothers fleeing abusive relationships, employees seeking fair treatment,
tenants facing eviction – at an extreme disadvantage. Those impacted most are
our mothers, sisters, children and grandparents.
D. THAT the City of Vancouver encourages the Province of British Columbia to
resolve this matter with the Association of Legal Aid Lawyers.

AMENDMENT MOVED by Mayor Stewart

FURTHER THAT D be amended as follows:

AMENDMENT TO THE AMENDMENT MOVED by Councillor Bligh
THAT the amendment be deleted and replaced with the following:
THAT Council direct the Mayor, on behalf of Council, to write to the
BC Attorney General, David Eby, to express Council’s appreciation for the
provincial government’s efforts to resolve the legal aid funding issue with the
Association of Legal Aid Lawyers (ALL) as well as the ongoing steps being taken
toward a long-term legal aid negotiation framework and a smoother negotiating
process in the future;
FURTHER THAT the Mayor’s letter to the BC Attorney General should make
note of the fact that legal aid is an essential public service that provides legal
representation to the most vulnerable, marginalized, and impoverished members
of our city and province, and that copies of the Mayor’s letter be sent to the
Legal Services Society (LSS), the Association of Legal Aid Lawyers (ALL), the
Union of British Columbia Municipalities (UBCM), and Lower Mainland Local
Government Association (LMLGA).

6. Making the Case for Housing All People Counted as Homeless in Shelters or on
the Street
On April 2, 2019, Vancouver City Council referred this matter to the Standing Committee on
Policy and Strategic Priorities meeting on April 3, 2019, in order to hear from speakers.
The Committee heard from four speakers in support of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Swanson
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. People who are homeless have about half the life expectancy of housed people;
2. Studies show that it’s cheaper to house people who are homeless than to provide
services to them on the street;
3. We now have a successful model (through the Modular Housing Program) for
quickly housing street and sheltered homeless people;
4. Modular housing doesn’t have to be temporary if it is built with a foundation;
5. The dramatic increase in homelessness has occurred since the Federal Government
reduced its support for the National Housing Program in the 1990’s;
6. Vancouver spends millions of dollars trying to help, move, house, and respond to
complaints about people who are homeless.

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, April 3, 2019 12
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct City of Vancouver staff to develop a human and business
case for the Federal and Provincial governments to increase and co-ordinate
delivery of social housing to house people who are homeless and people at risk
of homelessness. The business case should demonstrate the direct costs
incurred by all three levels of government to deal with homelessness in
Vancouver and Metro Vancouver (depending on scope of research), versus the
capital and operating funding required to build permanent housing for all the
counted people who are homeless and for people at risk of homelessness.
B. THAT the business case includes the amount of funding (capital and operating
grants, excluding financing) that the Federal and Provincial governments have
provided for housing people who are homeless or at risk of homelessness over
the last two years and the annual direct cost of homelessness to the City of
Vancouver (outreach, street/engineering, park rangers, shelters, warming
centres, grants to non-profits to make housing affordable for low income people,
DCL exemptions and waivers for social, supportive and rental housing, value of
CAC’s, density bonusing and inclusionary zoning attributable to housing for
people who are homeless, City land, foregone property taxes, etc.) and the
Metro Region (depending on scope), versus the capital and operating funding
required to build permanent housing (which could be modular) for all the counted
people who are homeless and people at risk of homelessness.
C. THAT the business case be presented to the Federal government by the end of
June, 2019 to allow for maximum impact on election platforms along with
requests to the Federal and Provincial governments for the funds required to
house all people who are counted as homeless and people at risk of
homelessness in Vancouver and (if within scope) the Metro Region.
D. THAT the business case outlined above be made public.
E. THAT staff be asked to consult with modular housing residents and people who
are homeless and groups they belong to, in order to make the human case.
F. THAT if there is not currently the staff capacity to complete this work, that
Council direct staff to procure an outside consultant to prepare the business
case.

MOVED by Councillor Swanson
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. The goal of the Rental 100 program, in place since 2012, has been to provide
more affordable housing for Vancouver residents;
2. The City of Vancouver’s “10 Year Affordable Housing Delivery and Financial
Strategy,” states that “the City has been successful in increasing housing options
for renter households (both individuals and families) earning $50,000 to
$150,000/year. While this increased supply in rental housing has been welcome
and has addressed the needs of many middle income households, the level of
affordability that can be delivered in market rental homes continues to be a
challenge for households in the lower-income bands. This includes families and
individuals earning less than $50,000/year, individuals who are currently
homeless and those who are at risk of homelessness living in inadequate and
unsafe conditions”;
3. There is growing concern that housing created under the Rental 100 program is
not affordable enough to meet the needs of Vancouver renters, due in part to
rules that allow owners to raise rents without limit after the first tenant leaves and
because initial rents are high;
4. Preservation of existing rental stock has been identified as an important part of
addressing the City’s housing affordability issues and protecting tenants, as
outlined in the February 27, 2019, report to Council: Renter Protection Work
Program;

Minutes, Wednesday, April 3, 2019 16
5. The City now has the ability to zone for rental only so we don’t need incentives
for rental construction as a way of preventing condo construction.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to include in their winter 2019 report back on
Rental 100 and related matters:
i. How to use rental only zoning to incentivize rental construction
that truly meets the needs of low and middle income renters; and
ii. How to stop incentivizing demovictions by excluding from
incentive programs new rentals that demolish existing affordable
rentals.
B. THAT current applicants to the Rental 100 program and those who inquire about
it be alerted to the current Rental Incentive Review underway and “Changing
Vancouver’s Housing By-laws, Policies and Budgets to Achieve Real Housing
Affordability” motion passed February 26, 2019, in order to reduce the possibility
of incurring unintended harm during this time of transition with a newly elected
City Council.
C. THAT Council instruct the Director of Legal Services to bring forward for
enactment an amendment to the Vancouver Development Cost Levy By-law and
the Area Specific Development Cost Levy By-law that would suspend, as soon
as possible, the development cost levy waiver for for-profit rental housing until a
thorough review of the Rental 100 program can be undertaken.
