COUNCIL MEMBERS’ MOTIONS
1. Jumpstarting Rental Housing: Bold Action to Boost Rental Housing Construction
in Tough Economic Times
The Committee heard from one speaker that spoke in support of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Bligh
SECONDED by Councillor Fry
THAT the Committee recommend to Council

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, June 18, 2025 9
WHEREAS
1. The City of Vancouver faces a significant housing affordability crisis, with a
pressing need for more purpose-built rental housing;
2. Redevelopment of properties for rental housing often results in higher assessed
property values, leading to increased property taxes that can deter investment in
rental housing development;
3. Encouraging the construction of rental housing is a key priority for the City’s
housing strategy and aligns with broader regional and provincial housing goals;
4. A temporary deferral of property tax increases, holding the tax rate based on the
pre-redevelopment assessed value for a set period, may provide an incentive for
rental housing development while mitigating financial pressures during the
construction and stabilization phases;
5. Other municipalities have explored or implemented similar tax deferral measures
to support rental housing investment and affordability; and
6. The economic viability of new rental housing in Vancouver has been significantly
undermined by sustained high interest rates, escalating construction and labour
costs, and limited access to conventional financing, creating urgent barriers to
purpose-built rental development.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct City staff to report back on options to design a program of
tax abatement for projects that prioritize rental and below market rental units
while deferring increases in property taxes for properties redeveloped for rental
housing, holding the tax rate based on the assessed value prior to
redevelopment, for a determined period.
B. THAT the staff report noted in A above consider:
i. Legal and legislative feasibility under provincial and municipal tax
regulations; including but not exclusive to considering usage of the
permissive exemption under the Vancouver Charter;
ii. Potential financial and budgetary impacts for the City;
iii. Criteria and eligibility requirements for properties to qualify for the tax
deferral including potential geographic exclusions;
iv. Mechanisms to ensure the policy supports rental housing affordability and
long-term tenure;
v. A permanent or time-limited incentive focused program design; and

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, June 18, 2025 10
vi. Best practices from other jurisdictions with similar tax deferral programs.
C. THAT Council direct staff to seek to engage with relevant stakeholders, including
housing providers, non-profit organizations, developers, and appropriate
provincial ministries.

AMENDMENT MOVED by Councillor Maloney
SECONDED by Councillor Orr
THAT B(iv) be amended by adding the words “deep affordability tied to local income
levels, long-term rental tenure, and prioritizes developments with a mix of unit sizes
suitable for families, seniors, and equity-deserving populations,” after the word
“supports”;
FURTHER THAT the following be added as B(vii):
Consider eligibility criteria that prioritizes or provides additional benefits to
projects developed or operated in partnership with non-profit housing providers,
co-operatives, or Indigenous housing organizations.

MOVED by Councillor Dominato
SECONDED by Councillor Meiszner
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, June 18, 2025 11
1. The City of Vancouver is committed to Vision Zero, which aims to eliminate traffic
deaths and serious injuries;
2. A key part of achieving the Vision Zero goal is working directly with communities
on safety planning;
3. The School Travel Planning program (STP) has been helping students walk,
bike, and roll to school safely for over 10 years, while involving families and
schools in conversations about road safety and active travel;
4. Through STP, the City assists with data collection, provides infrastructure
improvements and support, and creates personalized action plans collaboratively
with participating schools and stakeholders;
5. Each STP project takes place over three years and includes research,
consultation, on-the-ground improvements, and follow-up. These projects have
consistently made travel safer and easier for students and have helped build trust
with communities;
6. The program also plays an important role in teaching kids and youth about safe
and sustainable ways to get around;
7. Despite its success, the STP program currently works with only about four
schools per year out of 107 in the Vancouver School District, which means each
school participates only once per generation;i
8. The limited reach of the STP program creates inequities, especially for schools in
underserved areas that often face higher traffic safety risks and have fewer
supports for active travel;
9. To date, 49 schools have participated in the School Travel Planning Program;
10. STP is part of the broader School Active Travel Program, which currently has a
$750,000 annual budget; and
11. There is unmet demand and a significant opportunity to scale-up the successful
STP program with a modest increase in funding and capacity.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to report back by end of Q3 2025 with options and
costs associated with increasing the number of schools served each year by the
School Travel Planning program.
B. THAT Council reaffirm its support for the School Travel Planning program as a
key part of the Vision Zero initiative and the City’s active transportation efforts,
and ensure that expanding this program will not take away resources from other
road safety or equity-focused mobility programs.
