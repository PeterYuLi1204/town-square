5. Protecting BC Coasts From Acidic Washwater Dumping (Member’s Motion B.3)
At the Council meeting on March 1, 2022, Council referred the following motion to the Standing
Committee on Policy and Strategic Priorities meeting on March 2, 2022, in order to hear from
speakers, followed by debate and decision.
The Committee heard from one speaker in support of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Fry
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. In order to mitigate sulphur air pollution from burning heavy oil, the maritime
shipping industry employs Exhaust Gas Cleaning Systems (scrubbers) which
result in a washwater solution of concentrated acidic sulphates, metals, and other
toxins. Cruise, cargo, and other vessel traffic in Canadian jurisdiction annually
discharge tens of millions tonnes of this acidic washwater directly into BC’s
Coastal waters;

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, March 02, 2022 7
2. Globally, the issue of scrubber discharge1 is a growing concern. The International
Council on Clean Transportation report of April 29, 2021,2 makes clear that
scrubber effluent creates pollution that causes harm to the ocean, both locally
and on an international scale. That same report found that Vancouver was the
fourth most dumped upon port globally;
3. Ocean acidification is of major concern to coastal communities, particularly those
coastal communities encouraging shellfish harvesting, aquaculture, tourism, and
commercial and recreational fisheries. Worldwide, authorities have variously
banned or are moving to limit the dumping of scrubber wash in coastal waters.
On the Pacific Coast of North America, California and Washington3,4 have
implemented stricter protections, and on March 1, 2022, the Vancouver Fraser
Port Authority 5 intend to introduce phase one (of three) of new exhaust gas
cleaning systems wash water discharge requirements within its jurisdiction after
conclusive findings showed negative effects on aqualife and concentrations of
metals that exceeded thresholds;
4. Pacific Canada is one of the most diverse and productive marine environments in
the world. The Province of British Columbia has recently committed6 to develop a
new coastal marine strategy – in cooperation with the federal government,
Indigenous peoples, and coastal communities – to provide a blueprint for future
stewardship, economic resilience and management of our coastal waters;
5. In January 2022, Vancouver City Council affirmed support for the Year of the
Salish Sea and recognized that “the Salish Sea is witnessing devastating
biodiversity loss, namely the risk of extinction of over 100 species of birds, fish,
invertebrates, mammals, and key species including Salmon and the Southern
Resident Killer Whales.”7
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT the following resolution be submitted to the LMLGA and UBCM for
consideration at their respective policy conventions:
WHEREAS in order to mitigate sulphur air pollution from burning heavy
oil, the maritime shipping industry employs exhaust gas cleaning systems
(scrubbers) which result in a solution of concentrated acidic sulphates,
metals, and other toxins. Cruise and cargo vessel traffic in Canadian
jurisdiction annually discharge tens of millions tonnes of this acidic
washwater directly into BC’s Coastal waters;
AND WHEREAS ocean acidification is of major concern to coastal
communities, particularly those coastal communities encouraging
shellfish harvesting, aquaculture, tourism, and commercial and
recreational fisheries. Worldwide, authorities have variously banned or
are moving to limit the dumping of scrubber wash in coastal waters. On
the Pacific Coast of North America, California and Washington have
implemented stricter protections, and on March 1st, 2022 the Vancouver
Fraser Port Authority will introduce phase one (of three) of new exhaust
gas cleaning systems washwater discharge requirements in its jurisdiction
after conclusive findings showed negative effects on aqualife and
concentrations of metals that exceeded safe thresholds:

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, March 02, 2022 8
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT UBCM request the BC
government commit to advocate to the federal government on the issue of
exhaust gas cleaning systems’ acidic wastewater discharge, as part of a
comprehensive BC Coastal Marine Strategy; pushing for stronger
environmental protections, in line with thriving cruise and cargo waters of
our US neighbours, to include preventative measures to stop scrubber
dumping from ships and require cleaner fuels be used.
B. THAT Council send a letter directly to the Minister of Transport, the honourable
Omar Alghabra, asking Transport Canada to take action on dumping from
vessels including exhaust gas cleaning systems effluent and washwater dumping
as part of any plan to encourage growth and increase numbers of large vessels
transiting through or coming to Canadian jurisdiction.
C. THAT Council send a letter directly to the Vancouver Fraser Port Authority in
support of their new exhaust gas cleaning systems washwater discharge
requirements, and in encouragement of the Port’s transition to greening the
industry through shore power, rolling truck age program and further strengthened
regulations to include all washwater discharge and eventually prohibiting the use
of scrubbers.

6. The Unintended Consequences of Recent Policy Changes to DCL Waivers on
Affordable Housing (Member’s Motion B.7)
At the Council meeting on March 1, 2022, Council referred the following motion to the Standing
Committee on Policy and Strategic Priorities meeting on March 2, 2022, in order to hear from
speakers, followed by debate and decision.
The Committee heard from two speakers in support of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Hardwick
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. The Development Cost Levy (DCL) Waiver was implemented in City of
Vancouver policy to incentivize secured market rental projects that include levels
of affordability below market. In July 2018 Council approved the Utilities
Development Cost Levy (UDCL) Waiver that came into effect in September 2018.
Eligible projects that obtained a building permit before September 30, 2021, were
granted extensions;
2. The Housing Vancouver Strategy includes the target of 20,000 new secured
rental units over ten years (by 2027);
3. The ‘Below Market Rental Housing Policy for Rezonings’ was approved by
Council on November 26, 2019, and states:
“After three years of monitoring, the City is not achieving the annual
targets set out in Housing Vancouver for new secured rental housing
affordable to households earning $80,000 per year and below.
Concurrently, Vancouver’s purpose-built rental vacancy rate has been
less than 1 percent since 2014 while the proportion of renter households
in Vancouver continues to rise, resulting in more renters competing for a
limited number of rental units.”
4. Recent changes to the DCL bylaw eliminated previous waivers. Projects with
applications submitted before September 30, 2020, were to be provided in-
stream rate protection and the UDCL waiver, but only if they were granted a
Building Permit by September 30, 2021;
5. Many projects in compliance with the Rental 100 policy received regulatory
approval from Council before September 2020. Pro formas were calculated,
including DCL waivers applicable at the time of application. Housing Agreements
between the applicant and the City of Vancouver were negotiated conditional to
DCL waivers;
6. A total of thirteen projects were eligible for in-stream rate protection if eligible for
a building permit by the deadline of September 30, 2021. Staff have confirmed of
the thirteen, four projects, each approved by Council for thirty-fifty units of
secured market rental, were close to eligibility but did not meet the deadline;
7. Levels of affordability were secured with Housing Agreements for the thirteen
projects in exchange for a DCL or UDCL waiver. Non-market rental units

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, March 02, 2022 10
previously approved in Housing Agreements will no longer apply without the DCL
waiver. The result will be market rental for all units in each of these projects; and
8. Without the DCL/UDCL waiver, some projects may not be viable and may be
abandoned by applicants, affecting the overall overcomes of delivering secured-
rental in the Housing Vancouver Strategy.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to explore and establish criteria and bring
recommendations to Council with options to amend the Development Cost Levy
(DCL) waiver to provide a mechanism to provide incentives, including but not
limited to DCL waivers, that will protect the levels of affordability negotiated in the
Rental 100 projects that Council approved, yet did not meet the deadlines for in-
stream rate protection;
FURTHER THAT staff report back to Council with these recommendations before
the end of April 2022.
B. THAT Council direct staff to provide metrics on how the changes to the housing
agreements in the absence of these waivers will affect the number and
affordability of units projected in the Housing Vancouver Strategy.

FURTHER THAT A be amended by deleting the second clause;
AND FURTHER THAT B be deleted.

7. Centering Community Facilities and Infrastructure in 2023-2026 Capital Plan
(Member’s Motion B.8)
At the Council meeting on March 1, 2022, Council referred the following motion to the Standing
Committee on Policy and Strategic Priorities meeting on March 2, 2022, in order to hear from
speakers, followed by debate and decision.
The Committee heard from two speakers in support of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. The City of Vancouver Capital Plan is a four-year financial plan for investments in
the City's infrastructure and amenities such as water and sewer pipes, roads,
sidewalks, curb cuts, traffic signals and bikeways, community centres and
recreational facilities, arts and culture spaces, parks and open spaces, fire halls,
and libraries;
2. Vancouver’s 2023-2026 Capital Plan is currently being developed and is slated
for Council review and approval by July of this year;
3. Vancouver’s population is expected to grow by approximately 70,000 people in
the next 14 years and 188,000 in the next 39 years;
4. Vancouver has an existing infrastructure deficit that is significant and growing. It
includes the need for new and upgraded public-serving community facilities, as
well as utility upgrades and replacement of core City infrastructure that is at or
nearing the end of its life;
5. Aging infrastructure in the City includes water and sewer pipes that date from
1886 to the early 1960s, as well as community centres and recreational facilities
that were built between the 1940s and early 1980s;

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, March 02, 2022 13
6. There is also a need to address disparities between “have” and “have not”
neighbourhoods with respect to community and public safety facilities such as
community centres, ice rinks, and fire halls;1
7. There is also a growing demand from residents for improved streets and street
safety infrastructure such as pedestrian signals and flashing beacons, bike
routes, and lighting that support denser neighbourhoods and safely moving about
without the use of a vehicle;
8. Community facilities and infrastructure are key to livability in an increasingly
dense and unaffordable city. Vancouver’s pace has fallen behind in renewing
existing facilities and delivering new amenities to serve its current population let
alone a growing one. For example, it has taken decades to move forward with
renewal of the Marpole Community Centre that was built in 1949;
9. Likewise, the Kerrisdale Arena which dates back to 1949 also needs attention,
while at the same time the West End Plan amenities remain outstanding, the
Hastings Community Centre renewal has been shelved, and newly-established
and now populated neighbourhoods like the East Fraser Lands do not have a
community centre at all;
10. Significantly, the Gastown Complete Street project to protect this historic
neighbourhood and unlock its pedestrian potential has not been moved forward;
11. Recently, in response to a Council motion, staff have begun to quantify the
downloading of costs by senior levels of government, including spheres of federal
and/or provincial government jurisdictional responsibility such as housing and
childcare where the City has stepped in to deliver those services to meet
community needs;
12. Vancouver also experiences cost pressures and pressures on City operations
due to the impacts of the homelessness and mental health and addictions crises.
Without the requisite senior government support, these are rapidly eroding
Vancouver’s ability to deliver on civic and community facilities and infrastructure;
13. A recent staff report estimates the shortfall in senior government capital funding
due to cuts and/or reductions in funding – or where funding has not kept pace
with cost increases – to be in the order of ~$230.1 million, with an ~$158 million
shortfall that largely pertains to affordable housing needs and an ~$50 million
shortfall in funding support for the City’s Climate Emergency Response;
14. In response to COVID-19 related revenue shortfalls, staff sought and Council
approved a reduction of ~$254 million to the 2019-2022 Capital Plan, as well as
an allocation of ~$65 million of Emerging Priorities funding to support Council
priorities on climate emergency response, equity, and resilience. This
recalibration of the 2019-2022 Capital Plan was based on a comprehensive
review of major programs/projects across all service areas. Projects that were
determined could be de-scoped and/or deferred to future capital plans in whole
or in part due to the recalibration were largely centred on core infrastructure such
as:
• the installation and/or refurbishment of curb ramps at intersections,
• the installation of new traffic signals where none currently exist,

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, March 02, 2022 14
• new street lighting,
• the Gastown Complete Street project,
• renewal and expansion of the West End community centre,
• upgrading of existing sewer mains to meet growth-related demands,
• and projects to ensure water system resilience among many others;2
15. Community facilities and core infrastructure, in addition to being a core civic
responsibility, are also climate infrastructure. During extreme weather events due
to climate change, the city’s community centres become cooling and warming
centers and gathering spaces where the community comes together. Aging and
unseparated sewer pipes can result in overflows and flooding due to extreme
weather and degrade our environment;
16. The City’s transportation infrastructure, which includes new sidewalks, curb cuts,
and traffic lights, also plays a vital role in supporting climate resiliency. Being
able to walk and ride safely in your neighbourhood gives people greener
alternatives and supports health and livability;
17. On February 9, 2022, Council unanimously supported a motion to align
Vancouver’s 2023-2026 Capital Plan with increased climate emergency action.
The motion directed staff to report back early in the 2023-2026 capital budget
planning process with a list of potential capital projects, with associated costs,
benefits and estimated Green House Gas (GHG) reductions, to achieve – among
other things – the necessary reductions in the city’s GHG emissions to reach, at
minimum, the stated goal of 50% reductions in GHG emissions below 2007
levels by 2030;
18. An amendment to the February 9, 2022, motion added direction to staff to also
report back with a list of potential capital projects intended to address
Vancouver’s combined sewer overflows as part of the City’s commitment to
accelerate action on overflow reduction using a “One Water” integrated
approach, including associated costs and environmental benefits; and
19. Having renewed and new community facilities and core infrastructure is essential
to residents’ quality of life and helps to create equity and ensure climate
resiliency. As Vancouver’s population continues to grow, and the city’s already
aging infrastructure and amenities continue to degrade, the City needs to make
sufficient, strategic investments to maintain livability and to enhance the
sustainability and resilience of our city.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to report back early in the 2023-2026 capital budget
planning process with a list of potential capital projects that centers community
facilities and aging infrastructure to address the City’s significant infrastructure
deficit, including utility upgrades and core infrastructure at the end of its duty
cycle which needs to be replaced.
B. THAT the list of potential capital projects include community facilities such as the
new East Fraser Lands Community Centre, the renewal and expansion of the
West End Community Centre, streets initiatives like the Gastown Complete
Street Project, new and improved sidewalks and walking paths, curb ramps at
intersections, pedestrian signals and beacons, the installation of new traffic

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, March 02, 2022 16
FINAL MOTION AS APPROVED
WHEREAS
1. The City of Vancouver Capital Plan is a four-year financial plan for investments in
the City's infrastructure and amenities such as water and sewer pipes, roads,
sidewalks, curb cuts, traffic signals and bikeways, community centres and
recreational facilities, arts and culture spaces, parks and open spaces, fire halls,
and libraries;
2. Vancouver’s 2023-2026 Capital Plan is currently being developed and is slated
for Council review and approval by July of this year;
3. Vancouver’s population is expected to grow by approximately 70,000 people in
the next 14 years and 188,000 in the next 39 years;
4. Vancouver has an existing infrastructure deficit that is significant and growing. It
includes the need for new and upgraded public-serving community facilities, as
well as utility upgrades and replacement of core City infrastructure that is at or
nearing the end of its life;
5. Aging infrastructure in the City includes water and sewer pipes that date from
1886 to the early 1960s, as well as community centres and recreational facilities
that were built between the 1940s and early 1980s;
6. There is also a need to address disparities between “have” and “have not”
neighbourhoods with respect to community and public safety facilities such as
community centres, ice rinks, and fire halls;1
7. There is also a growing demand from residents for improved streets and street
safety infrastructure such as pedestrian signals and flashing beacons, bike
routes, and lighting that support denser neighbourhoods and safely moving about
without the use of a vehicle;
8. Community facilities and infrastructure are key to livability in an increasingly
dense and unaffordable city. Vancouver’s pace has fallen behind in renewing
existing facilities and delivering new amenities to serve its current population let
alone a growing one. For example, it has taken decades to move forward with
renewal of the Marpole Community Centre that was built in 1949;
9. Likewise, the Kerrisdale Arena which dates back to 1949 also needs attention,
while at the same time the West End Plan amenities remain outstanding, the
Hastings Community Centre renewal has been shelved, and newly-established
and now populated neighbourhoods like the East Fraser Lands do not have a
community centre at all;
10. Significantly, the Gastown Complete Street project to protect this historic
neighbourhood and unlock its pedestrian potential has not been moved forward;
11. Recently, in response to a Council motion, staff have begun to quantify the
downloading of costs by senior levels of government, including spheres of federal
and/or provincial government jurisdictional responsibility such as housing and
childcare where the City has stepped in to deliver those services to meet
community needs;

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, March 02, 2022 17
12. Vancouver also experiences cost pressures and pressures on City operations
due to the impacts of the homelessness and mental health and addictions crises.
Without the requisite senior government support, these are rapidly eroding
Vancouver’s ability to deliver on civic and community facilities and infrastructure;
13. A recent staff report estimates the shortfall in senior government capital funding
due to cuts and/or reductions in funding – or where funding has not kept pace
with cost increases – to be in the order of ~$230.1 million, with an ~$158 million
shortfall that largely pertains to affordable housing needs and an ~$50 million
shortfall in funding support for the City’s Climate Emergency Response;
14. In response to COVID-19 related revenue shortfalls, staff sought and Council
approved a reduction of ~$254 million to the 2019-2022 Capital Plan, as well as
an allocation of ~$65 million of Emerging Priorities funding to support Council
priorities on climate emergency response, equity, and resilience. This
recalibration of the 2019-2022 Capital Plan was based on a comprehensive
review of major programs/projects across all service areas. Projects that were
determined could be de-scoped and/or deferred to future capital plans in whole
or in part due to the recalibration were largely centred on core infrastructure such
as:
• the installation and/or refurbishment of curb ramps at intersections,
• the installation of new traffic signals where none currently exist,
• new street lighting,
• the Gastown Complete Street project,
• renewal and expansion of the West End community centre,
• upgrading of existing sewer mains to meet growth-related demands,
• and projects to ensure water system resilience among many others;2
15. Community facilities and core infrastructure, in addition to being a core civic
responsibility, are also climate infrastructure. During extreme weather events due
to climate change, the city’s community centres become cooling and warming
centers and gathering spaces where the community comes together. Aging and
unseparated sewer pipes can result in overflows and flooding due to extreme
weather and degrade our environment;
16. The City’s transportation infrastructure, which includes new sidewalks, curb cuts,
and traffic lights, also plays a vital role in supporting climate resiliency. Being
able to walk and ride safely in your neighbourhood gives people greener
alternatives and supports health and livability;
17. On February 9, 2022, Council unanimously supported a motion to align
Vancouver’s 2023-2026 Capital Plan with increased climate emergency action.
The motion directed staff to report back early in the 2023-2026 capital budget

benefits and estimated Green House Gas (GHG) reductions, to achieve – among
other things – the necessary reductions in the city’s GHG emissions to reach, at
minimum, the stated goal of 50% reductions in GHG emissions below 2007
levels by 2030;
18. An amendment to the February 9, 2022, motion added direction to staff to also
report back with a list of potential capital projects intended to address
Vancouver’s combined sewer overflows as part of the City’s commitment to

accelerate action on overflow reduction using a “One Water” integrated
approach, including associated costs and environmental benefits; and

to residents’ quality of life and helps to create equity and ensure climate
resiliency. As Vancouver’s population continues to grow, and the city’s already

8. A Regulatory Framework to Enable Innovative Urban Activation Projects
(Member’s Motion B.10)
At the Council meeting on March 1, 2022, Council referred the following motion to the Standing
Committee on Policy and Strategic Priorities meeting on March 2, 2022, in order to hear from
speakers, followed by debate and decision.
The Committee heard from four speakers in support of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Dominato
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. Vancouver City Council strives at all times to create walkable, complete,
connected, culturally vibrant neighbourhoods, including the larger aspiration to
become a 15-minute city that lessens the use of personal vehicles, activates
underutilized urban spaces, and bring goods and services closer to end
consumers in their neighborhoods;1
2. The circumstances and conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic over the past two
years have neither altered nor diminished Council’s commitment to creating
walkable, complete, connected, culturally vibrant neighbourhoods;
3. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a wide range of adaptations,
innovations, and societal changes in many spheres of life including changes in
consumer behaviour, in how and where people work, as well as a marked
increase in all manner of e-commerce transactions and delivery mechanisms for
goods and services to consumers;
4. Encouraging and facilitating social, cultural, and technological innovations,
wherever and whenever these have demonstrated the power and potential to a)
enhance and improve the lives of the city’s residents and businesses, b) advance
the policy goals and objectives of Council and the City, and c) activate and
otherwise enrich the city’s neighbourhoods, is fundamentally sound from a public
policy perspective and logical for elected bodies to embrace and enable;
5. As a 21st century society, we live in a state of constant evolution and rapid
innovation, with fast-changing trends among consumers that – in many ways –
respond to innovations and new technologies. At the most basic level, innovation
means introducing new methods, ideas, or products and it includes the
development of new processes and business models that better fit the needs of
consumers;
6. A number of innovative projects that exemplify new methods, ideas, products,
and/or business models that respond to the evolving needs of consumers have
recently come to the attention of members of Council. These projects have the
clear potential to support Council’s objective to
a) create walkable, complete, connected, culturally vibrant neighbourhoods;
b) become a 15-minute city;
c) activate the city’s streets and underutilized urban spaces; and
d) bring goods and services closer to end consumers in their
neighborhoods;

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, March 02, 2022 20
7. Despite the City’s and Council’s stated policy objectives and the strategies meant
to achieve these objectives, the City’s existing By-laws and permitting framework
have proven challenging to several of these innovative projects because they do
not fit easily into the existing categories and structures of the City’s regulatory
framework. Instead of proceeding smoothly toward activating underutilized
spaces in the city, these projects have encountered a variety of policy, By-law,
and permitting obstacles, impediments, challenges, and paradoxes;
8. Examples of several innovative projects that embody new methods, ideas,
products, and/or business models that have encountered By-law, policy, and
permitting obstacles and impediments due to the limitations, structures, and
categories of the City’s current regulatory framework include:
• ROLL TECHNOLOGIES: A Canadian company that aims to bridge the
gaps in public transportation and grow micro-mobility alternatives safely
and sustainably toward reshaping urban mobility as cities outgrow their
reliance on cars. The company is working to launch a pilot in Vancouver
with 50 e-bikes this spring and summer, leveraging underutilized space in
City owned EasyPark lots. Each e-bike has its own physical locking
mechanism on the back wheel, with an app used to unlock the bikes. In
addition to the requirement of a business license for each site, the
operator was initially advised that a Development Permit (DP) was
required for each EasyPark location. Car share companies leasing spots
in EasyPark lots do not require a DP, adding confusion and complexity to
the application;
• BLOOM COMMUNITY PROJECTS: The Bloom project seeks to activate
underutilized urban spaces with retail and food opportunities. Their
current project is to activate the south side of The Plaza Nations on a
seasonal basis. The project would create a free-flowing outdoor patio
space with pop-up units ranging in size from 150 – 200 square feet.
These pop-up units would feature local retailers, rotating
artists/installations, food and beverage kiosks, as well as breweries,
cafés, snacks, wine bars, and cocktail collaborations. The project is
intended to showcase and support local businesses and provide a unique
customer experience for pedestrians along a heavily used section of the
downtown seawall. The proposal requires a longer term special events
permit and a development permit. The process for obtaining and
coordinating these permits has been challenging, and the critical gap has
been there is no clear guidance for prospective proponents to follow;
• REEF TECHNOLOGY: REEF is the largest operator of neighbourhood
kitchens and urban logistics hubs in the United States and Canada. In
April of 2021, REEF announced an expansion of its NBRHD Restaurant
Development Program to Vancouver making use of underutilized urban
spaces. The REEF model is designed to help local restaurants scale their
delivery business and bring goods and services closer to end consumers
in their neighbourhoods. Vancouver is the first Canadian city for a REEF
pilot project, and restaurants with fewer than three locations are qualified
to apply for the pilot program – with priority for underrepresented groups
including local women and Indigenous-owned restaurants to apply.
Despite support for the project, it has encountered By-law, policy, and

Standing Committee of Council on Policy and Strategic Priorities
Minutes, Wednesday, March 02, 2022 21
permitting obstacles and impediments due to the limitations of the City’s
current regulatory framework;
• FARMERS MARKETS: Last summer the Vancouver Farmers Market
sought to relocate its Main Street location to 88 Pacific Boulevard,
triggering the usual special events permit, but also a Development Permit
(DP) because it was on private property. While the private property owner
supported the Farmer’s Market activating this urban space on a
temporary basis, there were concerns and confusion over the site
triggering a DP;
9. As with the examples of innovative projects noted above, urban agriculture
(community gardens, urban farms) and farmers markets represent additional
examples of innovative urban activation projects where By-law and permitting
challenges have been experienced. Staff advise that urban agriculture projects
are supported and facilitated by numerous City policies and strategies,
notwithstanding challenges that have been experienced; and
10. The regulatory obstacles and challenges that have been encountered by various
innovative projects that meet the stated policy objectives of Council and the City
point to the need for a review the City’s regulatory framework as it pertains to
innovative new land use models for underutilized urban spaces. There is a need
to ensure that the City’s By-laws, plans, policies, strategies, and procedures are
appropriately in alignment with the City’s stated policy objectives and therefore
capable of – and adaptable enough – to accommodate and facilitate innovative
projects that have the potential to benefit the city and its residents in a timely
manner by way of a more streamlined and simplified application and approval
process.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council direct staff to review the City’s
regulatory framework that currently enables innovative urban activation projects on
underutilized public and private properties with the goal of streamlining and simplifying
the process for prospective proponents, including consideration for establishing a clear
set of guidelines and pathways for advancing these projects;
FURTHER THAT staff be directed to report back to Council by the end of Q2 2023 with
recommendations for a draft set of guidelines and pathways that address current
obstacles and impediments to enabling innovative urban activation projects and models;
AND FURTHER THAT the guidelines to streamline and simplify the City’s existing
application and approval processes for innovative urban activation projects should serve
as a precursor to – and serve to inform – any and all future reviews and revisions to
relevant By-laws, policies, and regulatory frameworks as they relate to the City’s goal to
create walkable, complete, connected, culturally vibrant neighbourhoods in the city as
well as the larger aspiration to become a 15-minute city.
FOOTNOTES:
1. Creating complete, connected, and culturally vibrant neighbourhoods is a key
goal of the Vancouver Plan.
