2. Supporting Community-Led Public Safety in Mount Pleasant
MOVED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
SECONDED by Councillor Dominato
WHEREAS
1. The City of Vancouver has been committed to supporting Community Policing
Centres in neighbourhoods across Vancouver. The ideals of community policing
hold that communities are best served through place-based approaches tailored
to the unique needs of a neighbourhood;

Council Meeting
Minutes, July 20, 2021 27
2. Currently there are 11 Community Policing Centres (CPC’s) in the city. They hold
a unique position among crime prevention initiatives in North America, through
partnership between the community and its police force. Unlike their counterparts
in other cities, these centres are not satellite police stations -- they are
independent not-for-profit societies that are actually operated, staffed, and
governed by volunteer members of the community;
3. Community policing leverages the local knowledge and engagement of the
people who live, work and play there. Local residents work together to create
crime prevention programs and overall community engagement initiatives to
address health and safety concerns in their own neighbourhoods. These offices
have a unique position in aiding members of the community seeking help, or
connecting them with the various service providers in the area. These services
might be food, shelter, medical or mental health assistance as well as other
services;
4. CPC’s are located in Chinatown, Collingwood, Grandview-Woodland, Granville
Downtown South, Hastings-Sunrise, Kerrisdale, Oakridge & Marpole,
Kitsilano-Fairview, South Vancouver, Strathcona and West End-Coal Harbour.
There is also a dedicated Aboriginal CPC on Franklin Street;
5. The Mount Pleasant BIA (MPBIA) has identified that the Mount Pleasant
neighbourhood intersects with three separate CPCs, and feels it cannot be
appropriately serviced by these CPCs due to the rapid and ongoing growth of
Mount Pleasant, and the expansive area the existing CPCs currently have to
cover;
6. The area’s population increased by a significant 25% between 2011- 2016
according to the 2016 Census; substantially faster than all other neighbourhoods
in the city, with no signs of slowing down. Mount Pleasant is already under
pressure from development and with the upcoming Broadway Line expansion,
densification will only increase;
7. The MPBIA has identified the opportunity to establish a new Community Policing
Centre to serve the community, and is working with support of other local
stakeholders like the Crisis Intervention and Suicide Prevention Centre of BC,
Mount Pleasant Neighbourhood House and Coast Mental Health to bring the
initiative to fruition. Other groups who have expressed support for a dedicated
CPC include: the Mount Pleasant Community Centre Association, Mount
Pleasant Family Centre Society, local residents, local businesses from
restaurants to services, churches and arts groups. This network is working
toward establishing a not-for-profit governing society and forming an independent
Board of Directors. It is the intent that the Board represent the diversity of people
who call Mount Pleasant home, as well as the area’s diverse stakeholders. Once
the Board is established, staff will be hired and a location that is central to the
service area will be secured;
8. The MPBIA conducted a community safety survey about the proposed CPC
initiative, providing information on it to its members and residents, that indicated

Council Meeting
Minutes, July 20, 2021 28
strong support for the establishment of an area specific CPC, depicted growing
concerns about safety, and affirmed the desire for a service that encourages
community engagement and support, and will aid in connecting people to health,
community and social services;
9. The proposed contemplated service area for the new Mount Pleasant CPC would
center at the Main and Broadway corridor, extending from Cambie Street to Clark
Drive, 16th to Great Northern Way, and would encompass Olympic Village to the
waterfront. The area supported would be what the City of Vancouver deems the
Mount Pleasant neighbourhood.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Vancouver City Council supports the creation of a new Community
Policing Centre for the Mount Pleasant neighbourhood.
B. THAT Council direct staff to include consideration for funding support for a new
Mount Pleasant Community Policing Centre in the 2022 draft operating budget
and bring that forth as part of the 2022 budget presentation.

3. Considering Youth Housing Needs within the City’s Housing Strategy
MOVED by Councillor Dominato
SECONDED by Councillor Fry
WHEREAS
1. The Housing Vancouver Strategy sets out to address street homelessness and
enable more affordable housing choices, ensuring a diverse and vibrant city;
2. The City of Vancouver Housing Strategy embodies policies and various
directions to staff relating to the needs of specific population groups within the
city. For example, policies that enable MIRHPPs where 20 percent of the housing
is for a certain income range, social housing where 30 percent is at the HILs rate
and the remainder at market housing rates, and supportive housing models that
come forward at the will of various organizations per their specific area of interest
and/or need;

Council Meeting
Minutes, July 20, 2021 29
3. BC Housing has identified six sub-populations of youth who are overrepresented
in the larger homeless population. These six sub-populations of homeless youth
would benefit from a range of housing models identified by BC Housing and
youth-serving agencies; i
4. According to the 2020 Homeless Count, youth made up 9% of all identified
homeless residents in the City of Vancouver while 36 percent are/were in the
care of the Province (MCFD) as a child or youth. This data shows that there are
gaps in supports for youth aging out of care as well as gaps due to the on-going
impacts of systemic racism;
5. Each year in Vancouver, approximately 100 youth age out of government care
and/or youth agreements at the age of 19 years. For many youth in care, aging
out comes with fear and anxiety as they try to figure out how they will meet their
basic needs including housing, while losing services, support, and connections;
6. With reference to concerns relating to the issue of youth aging out of MCFD care
who are at risk of homelessness, Mayor and Council received a letter on behalf
of the TRRUST Collective (Transition in Resources, Relationships, and
Understanding Support Together) in November 2020 regarding youth housing
needs and challenges; ii
7. Detailed engagement of former youth in care by TRRUST regarding their
personal journeys reflects the benefits that come from supportive housing, but
also highlights housing barriers owing to the cost of rent, unsafe housing, and
stigma;
8. The Fostering Changes’ report, Opportunities in Transition, notes that most
young people aged 20 to 24 have low incomes and tend to rely on family for
additional financial support. In fact, 60 percent of youth in this age range live in
their parental homes. Youth aging out of care do not have that option and often
lack the financial resources to meet basic needs, including difficulty finding
housing in their community due to the Vancouver housing crisis, and often end
up couch surfing or homeless and living on the street;
9. The Representative for Children and Youth’s 2020 Report entitled A Parent’s
Duty: Government’s Obligation to Youth Transitioning into Adulthood,
recommends the Province provide additional dedicated housing for youth aging
out of care through a plan led by B.C. Housing to end youth homelessness, with
particular attention to youth transitioning out of care;
10. While the Housing Vancouver Strategy acknowledges youth are at higher risk of
homelessness, informal queries to City staff suggest that the City does not have
any specific or defined youth housing targets in the City’s housing strategy;
11. There is an opportunity for Council and the City of Vancouver to define and adopt
policies that could enable housing providers to respond to youth housing needs
and create and/or otherwise set aside housing units appropriate and specific to
youth needs.

Council Meeting
Minutes, July 20, 2021 30
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT Council alert and advise staff – by way of this
motion – of Council’s interest in examining the question of youth housing needs, within
the city’s larger housing needs spectrum, and considering these needs as part of the
City’s policy and planning processes;
FURTHER THAT Council direct staff to keep Council apprised of specific opportunities
and proposals for youth housing that could be enabled within the City’s existing housing
policy structures, including specific advice from staff regarding mechanisms to enable
opportunities for housing providers to set aside units specific to youth, and direction to
staff to include exploration of youth housing as part of future housing updates and
reports to Council.

ii The TRRUST Collective (Transition in Resources, Relationships, and Understanding Support
Together) is composed of over 60 organizations and 250 members, including non-profit
organizations, government agencies, and young people with lived experience of government
care (https://www.mcs.bc.ca/trrust). The common interest of all TRRUST members is to achieve
system-wide improvements in the outcomes for youth transitioning out of government care in

4. Planning to Support Distributed Ambulance Services in the City of Vancouver
MOVED by Councillor Fry
SECONDED by Councillor Dominato
WHEREAS
1. Keeping Vancouverites safe during and after a fire, natural disaster, or other
emergency, is a City priority. As the City’s website reminds: everyone plays a
role in making sure we all stay safe and secure. The City of Vancouver are

Council Meeting
Minutes, July 20, 2021 31
responsible for Police and Fire Rescue Services;
2. The provincial BC Ambulance Services (BCAS) are a key part of Vancouver’s
healthcare and public safety system, providing emergency medical services,
including pre-hospital treatment and ambulance transportation;
3. Vancouver Fire Rescue Services (VFRS) provide emergency paramedic
response, but are not equipped for advanced life support or patient transport to
hospital;
4. The BC Ambulance Service operate under the authority of BC Emergency Health
Services (BCEHS) a department of Provincial Health Services Authority (PHSA),
accountable to and a responsibility of the BC Ministry of Health;
5. BC Ambulance Paramedics and Emergency Dispatchers provide front line
staffing support for BC Ambulance Services and in recent years have expressed
concerns that in Vancouver and elsewhere in BC, services are stretched to
maximum workload capacity which is leading to higher levels of burnout and
stress related injuries for paramedics and longer wait times for patients;
6. Vancouver’s expanding population and higher call volumes mean higher demand
for ambulance services. The nationally accepted benchmark for response time in
a metro area is 8:59 minutes, and requires well-resourced and appropriately
distributed ambulance service stations that Vancouver is challenged to support;
7. In recent years due to management decisions and land economics, Vancouver
has lost ambulance service stations including the Downtown/West End’s 242
(Richards and Davie), South Van’s 244 (57th and Cambie), Advanced Care at
VGH, and stations at both Boundary and Hastings and Boundary and Vanness;
8. Distribution and location of the four remaining BC Ambulance Service Stations
within the City of Vancouver (excluding Children’s Hospital infant ambulance
station) are all low-density leased properties in highly developable areas:
a. Station 248 (DTES) 731 East Cordova;
b. Station 245 (Kingsway) 1538 East King Edward;
c. Station 243 (Arbutus Ridge) 2940 Arbutus St; and
d. Station 261 (Mt Pleasant) 181 West 7th;
9. At current, ambulance services for large parts of South Vancouver are seconded
to Burnaby and Richmond respectively. The entire downtown peninsula has one
overworked ambulance station in the DTES that also serves NE Vancouver;
10. In their 2019 review of BCEHS and report “Access to Emergency Health
Services,” the Office of the Attorney General of BC advised that the coordination
of fire departments and emergency health services needs to be strengthened. As
well, ambulance response times were taking too long and compromising patient
outcomes;

Council Meeting
Minutes, July 20, 2021 32
11. Municipalities have a role to ensure ambulance service stations and their
equitable distribution inform city planning and public benefit strategies. In
Richmond, the new Fire Hall 3 / Ambulance Service Station 250 at 9680 Cambie
is an example of a city-funded co-location, where purpose-built ambulance
station is leased to BCEHS and additionally benefits increased coordination
between fire and ambulance emergency services. Elsewhere, Revelstoke and
West Vancouver are both looking at building workforce housing with ambulance
service station co-location opportunities on city-owned land, leasing purpose built
stations to BCEHS;
12. The June 2021 heatwave saw catastrophic loss of life in Vancouver and across
the region, highlighting a number of emergency response fragilities, including the
ambulance system and need for a well-distributed and resourced service.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to report back on policy development options and
financial impacts to support distributed ambulance services in City of Vancouver,
including but not limited to:
a. Needs assessment that considers transportation networks, accessibility,
and resilience of existing and future ambulance service stations, best
practices and patient outcomes;
b. Advocacy and resources to support adding distributed ambulance service
stations in Vancouver; and
c. Exploring opportunities to co-locate leased BCAS stations with new VFRS
facilities; new hospital or clinical facilities; and/or other new
developments.
B. THAT the Mayor write a letter on behalf of council to the Premier and Minister of
Health advocating for robust ambulance services for the City of Vancouver,
sharing the city’s concerns and support for public safety and equitable
distribution of ambulance service.

5. Planning for Extreme Heat and Air Quality Mitigation in Vancouver
MOVED by Councillor Fry (on behalf of Vancouver City Planning Commission)
SECONDED by Councillor Kirby-Yung
WHEREAS
1. From June 25 to June 29, 2021, Vancouver and Southern British Columbia
experienced an unprecedented and record-breaking “heat dome” that imposed
significant health, safety, and operational impacts on the City, the region, and
most vulnerable residents. Tragically, that same time period saw 486 sudden and
unexpected deaths across the province, an increase of 195 per cent
presumptively linked to the heat wave;
2. Year after year British Columbia and the Pacific Coast have experienced record-
setting wildfires and temperatures, which scientists predict will only become more
common with climate change;
3. In January 2019, in response to the breakdown of the stable climate, Vancouver
declared a climate emergency and recognized that climate change shocks and
stresses put communities affected by systemic vulnerabilities and inequities at
the greatest risk;
4. The Vancouver City Planning Commission was established in 1977 by by-law to
advise City Council on planning and development issues in the City, and may
report to Council on any proposal likely to have a significant effect on the future
of the City;
5. In response to the recent extreme heat emergency, the Vancouver City Planning
Commission have prepared following memo “Climate Emergency: Extreme Heat
and Air Quality Mitigation” with direction to submit to council for consideration;
6. In 2019, Council approved an update to the City’s Climate Change Adaptation
Strategy, which sets out actions to reduce the impacts of climate change
(extreme heat, wildfire smoke, flooding, etc.) on our community, particularly on
