COUNCIL MEMBERS’ MOTIONS
1. Strengthening Tenant Relocation and Protection Policy in Vancouver
The Committee heard from two speakers who spoke in support of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Fry
SECONDED by Councillor Orr
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. The City of Vancouver is committed to protecting tenants from displacement and
ensuring affordable housing options are available, especially in the face of rising
redevelopment pressures and rent increases;
2. Redevelopment often leads to tenant displacement, which creates significant
financial and emotional hardship. Displaced tenants may struggle to find
affordable interim housing, face rent increases, or endure the stress of relocating
multiple times before returning to their homes. These hardships
disproportionately affect low-income residents, seniors, and families with
children;
3. Currently, the Tenant Relocation and Protection Policy under the Broadway Plan
area provides stronger tenant protections, including temporary rent top-up

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, April 16, 2025 7
options during displacement and discounted Right of First Refusal rents, which
are not available in other areas of the City;
4. A Temporary Rent Top-Up refers to a financial assistance mechanism provided to
displaced tenants, either as periodic payments or as a lump sum, to cover the
difference between their previous rent and their interim housing rent during
redevelopment. This helps to mitigate financial strain and provides stability for
tenants while awaiting their return to redeveloped housing;
5. The Right of First Refusal grants displaced tenants the first opportunity to return
to a newly redevelopment unit at a discounted rent, either 20% below the city-
wide average market rent for the same unit type, or at the tenant's current rent at
the time of the rezoning or development application, whichever is less;
6. The lack of a Density Offset formula in Vancouver has hindered the development
of affordable replacement units. A Density Offset Formula is a calculation used to
determine the additional density required to offset the costs of providing
affordable replacement units in redevelopment projects. The City of Burnaby,
among others, has successfully implemented this mechanism to ensure that
affordable units can be provided without harming the financial viability of the
projects, resulting in the successful development of affordable housing; and
7. As the City of Vancouver continues to grow, and redevelopment pressure is
expanding across the City, there is a need to extend these enhanced protections
and to create consistent, city-wide standards that protect tenants across all
neighbourhoods.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to review and report back with considerations to amend
the Tenant Relocation and Protection Policy to extend the additional protections
provided under the Broadway Plan to all areas of the city, specifically:
i. Implementing a Temporary Rent Top-Up option for all displaced tenants to
mitigate rent increases during interim housing periods. This option should
allow tenants the flexibility to choose between periodic payments or a
onetime lump sum at the tenant’s discretion;
ii. Offering Right of First Refusal to all displaced tenants at a 20% discount
off city-wide average market rents by unit type, or at their current rent at
time of application, with the discount guaranteed to be at the time of the
rezoning application or the development permit application, whichever is
less;
iii. Ensuring that new units can be secured either by the tenant themselves
or with assistance from the applicant, with the responsibility for payment
of the temporary rent top-up resting on the applicant;

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, April 16, 2025 8
iv. Allowing the satisfaction of the Right of First Refusal at discounted rents
in another rental building within or outside the initial redevelopment area
to enable a single move by the impacted tenant if they so choose.
B. THAT Council direct staff to report back with development of a Density Offset
formula, similar to the model used in the City of Burnaby, which will calculate how
much additional density is required to cover the costs of affordable replacement
units, ensuring a balanced approach between new development and tenant
protection.
C. THAT Council direct staff to report back with considerations for the eligibility of
tenant benefits under the Tenant Relocation and Protection Policy and Broadway
Plan and other enhanced tenant protections with the date of an accepted
rezoning or development permit application.
D. THAT Council direct staff to provide a report on the implementation of these
changes, including expected timelines and any potential impacts on current and
future development projects.

MOVED by Councillor Fry
SECONDED by Councillor Dominato
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. Felis catus, the small carnivorous mammal otherwise known as the house cat,
was first domesticated around 7500 BC. Today, they are a popular pet numbering
in the tens of thousands in the City of Vancouver. According to federal
government statistics for pet ownership, Canadian households with cats slightly
outnumber households with dogs at 50.9% to 49.1% respectively;
2. Cats are highly adaptable animals, and occurrences of lost, abandoned, or stray
cats are an unfortunate reality in the urban environment. Prior to a successful
trapping and sterilization program pioneered by Vancouver Orphan Kitten
Rescue Association (VOKRA), there were nearly 10,000 feral cats living on the
streets of Vancouver (2017)1;
3. Stray, abandoned, or feral cats can multiply rapidly, necessitating humane and
ethical population control measures. Cats can get pregnant at five months, and
can have up to three litters a year. Unchecked, feral cat colonies can significantly
disrupt ecosystems and pose public health risks through predation and the
spread of zoonotic diseases;

Minutes, Wednesday, April 16, 2025 10
4. Some other local cities manage stray cats as part of their animal control budget
and resourcing:
• Surrey Animal Services catch, accept surrenders, impound, provide
veterinary care, and rehome cats2;
• Burnaby provides assistance catching stray animals, and contracts BCSPCA
for animal care, surrender, shelter, and control services3;
• Coquitlam mandates cat registration and identification through its Animal
Care and Control By-law4, the city-run animal shelter impounds, cares for,
and re-homes abandoned cats in Coquitlam and Pitt Meadows (through a
special funding agreement);
5. Vancouver Animal Services (VAS) do not manage or control cats – feral, stray,
surrendered, or otherwise – except for temporary shelter in emergency services
involved cases (when someone is jailed or dies for example) which are
subsequently surrendered to VOKRA. VAS do take lost cat reports from the
public, and receives dead cats picked up by sanitation to check for microchips or
tattoos before cremating the bodies. In 2023 VAS processed 272 lost cat reports
and 64 deceased cats, in 2024 VAS processed 281 lost cat reports and 111
deceased cats. Independently of the city, the BCSPCA in Vancouver provide
surrender, rehoming, and microchip registration for cats, they generally don’t
trap, catch and impound stray cats, nor do they license cats;
6. Since 2000, Vancouver Orphan Kitten Rescue Association (VOKRA) has been
providing humane services to control, spay/neuter, and re-home stray,
abandoned, and feral cats. The volunteer-run not for profit charity includes a
network of 550 foster homes and is one of the only providers of free spay/neuter
for low-income cat-owners in Vancouver, as BCSPCA ceased their program last
year;
7. In Vancouver, the number of surrendered or abandoned cats has increased
dramatically since COVID and has been exacerbated by the lack of affordable
pet-friendly housing. In the last year, 55% of all the cats VOKRA cared for were
free roaming or abandoned. According to VOKRA’s records, intakes from the City
of Vancouver were:
• 386 cats in 2023: 175 strays, 180 surrenders, 30 low-income owner
spay/neuter, and 1 transfer from Vancouver Animal Control;
• 366 cats in 2024: 219 strays, 79 surrenders, 64 low-income owner
spay/neuter, and 4 transfers from Vancouver Animal Control;
8. The City of Vancouver currently supports VOKRA through a small Animal Welfare
Grant (provided to organizations to offset costs of providing supplemental animal
services to the City), for 2025, staff recommended $2,610 for VOKRA to assist
with the costs of spaying/neutering, vaccination, and microchipping of six cats.

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, April 16, 2025 11
VOKRA gets 70% of its revenue through individual donations, on top of
sponsorships and an annual $44k gaming grant. The BCSPCA does not provide
any supporting grants; and
9. VOKRA’s average basic cost for intaking a cat is $377.56 (2024) and includes
deworming, vaccine, flea treatment, microchip and spay/neuter. It does not
include food, litter, or veterinary care for illness or injuries. In recent years,
significant expenditure escalations have resulted from increases to the cost of
veterinary services and pet food. According to VOKRA’s records, the care and
medical costs (not including foster care or extra vet expenses) for cats taken in
from the streets of Vancouver increased from $66,073 in 2023 to $82,685 in
2024, despite a reduction in total number of cats.
Even with discounted services from partner clinics, veterinary costs have
increased by 32% in 2022 and an additional 25% in 2023. At the current rate of
financial pressure, and without meaningful and timely intervention, there are
serious concerns VOKRA may be unable to continue providing services. Without
VOKRA, there would be no stray cat control in the City of Vancouver.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to report back with considerations for regularized full or
partial funding of feline control services in the City of Vancouver, either as a
function of Vancouver Animal Services, or with an established reputable third
party like VOKRA or the BCSPCA;
FURTHER THAT Council direct staff to report the extent and cost of feline control
services currently provided by Vancouver Animal Services, VOKRA, and the
BCSPCA in Vancouver.
B. THAT Council direct staff to report back with considerations for definition and
administration of feline control services in the Animal Control By-law No. 9150 for
the purposes of carrying out the provisions of section 324 of the Vancouver
Charter.
C. THAT the Mayor formally recognizes and thanks VOKRA leadership and
volunteers for their ongoing commitment to humane feline control services in the
City of Vancouver since 2000.

3. Advocating for Pet-friendly Rental Housing
The Committee heard from three speakers who spoke in support of the motion.
MOVED by Councillor Fry
SECONDED by Councillor Kirby-Yung

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, April 16, 2025 12
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. Research indicates that companion animals improve cardiovascular health,
physical mobility, and mental well-being. The companionship of a pet can reduce
feelings of loneliness and can be a catalyst for improved relationships with
neighbours. These benefits are especially significant for seniors, unhoused
people looking to transition into permanent housing, and those with mental health
challenges;
2. Rental housing is already scarce in the City of Vancouver, housing insecurity is
exacerbated by the limited availability of pet-friendly rental units. This scarcity
often results in higher rents for pet-friendly units, forcing many tenants to make
the choice to rent a unit they cannot truly afford or compromise on other aspects
related to housing. When a tenancy ends, restrictions on pet-friendly options
often result in renters being forced to surrender their pets to avoid homelessness
- this burden disproportionately affects lower-income households;
3. Current tenant support policies and protections, such as the Tenant Relocation
and Protection Policy (TRPP), offer only limited protections for renters with pets.
The TRPP states that tenants who had previously had a pet under a pet-
accommodating tenancy will be offered a pet-friendly unit as part of the Right of
First Refusal. However, these same protections do not cover the interim alternate
accommodations - and an applicant is only required to demonstrate "reasonable
effort" in meeting a tenant's identified priorities, with pet-friendly housing being
listed as just one of several examples; and
4. Vancouver and British Columbia are lagging: No-pet clauses in Ontario are
specifically banned and protection is in place for individuals with companion
animals through the Ontario Residential Tenancies Act. Legislation has passed in
the U.S. and France recognizing the choice to have a companion animal as a
basic civil right. In 2020, Vancouver City Council unanimously voted to end no-
pet clauses; however, this will not result in any meaningful change or progress for
residents without further action. Significant work was also done by the prior
Renters Advisory Committee, which resulted in a successful motion put forward
by Councillors Fry and Swanson on behalf of the committee.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Vancouver City Council advocate to the Province of British Columbia, with
the following motion to UBCM, to Amend the Residential Tenancy Act to eliminate
no-pet clauses and better protect renters with pets:
WHEREAS a majority of British Columbian households include at least
one dog or cat, and that companionship imparts various wellbeing
benefits to mental and physical health;
AND WHEREAS housing insecurity is exacerbated by the limited
availability of pet-friendly rental units often resulting in higher rents, and

restrictions on pet-friendly housing often result in renters being forced to
surrender their pets to avoid homelessness, a burden that
disproportionately affects lower income households;
AND WHEREAS British Columbia is lagging other jurisdictions: No-pet
clauses in Ontario are specifically banned, and protection is in place for
individuals with companion animals through the Ontario Residential
Tenancies Act. Legislation has passed in the U.S. and France recognizing
the choice to have a companion animal as a basic civil right:
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT UBCM ask the Province of British
Columbia to amend the Residential Tenancy Act to prohibit blanket “no
pets” clauses in rental contracts, instead providing for appropriate
management guidelines, including requirements, tenant responsibilities,
and conditions for landlord indemnification in rental contracts for tenants
with pets.
B. THAT Vancouver City Council expand pet-friendly tenant protections within
policies, including but not limited to the Broadway Plan, the Tenant Relocation
and Protection Policy (TRPP), and as part of the scheduled 2026 review of the
Tenant Relocation and Protection Policy. These policies should ensure that
tenants displaced by redevelopment are guaranteed access to pet-friendly
housing both in the interim, and upon return to the redeveloped unit.
C. THAT Vancouver City Council encourage an increased percentage of new
purpose-built rental buildings to be pet-friendly. This measure will help alleviate
pressures such as scarcity, insecurity, and unaffordability, and appropriate
language should be integrated into the Housing Strategy Review and other
housing documents and plans going forward.

pressures such as scarcity, insecurity, and unaffordability, and appropriate
language should be integrated into the Housing Strategy Review and other
housing documents and plans going forward.
4. Enhanced Tools for Standards of Property Maintenance
The Committee heard from one speaker who spoke in support of the motion.

THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. The Vancouver Standards of Maintenance By-law does not specifically enforce or
address mould, water damage, or indoor air quality;
2. Standards of property maintenance are guidelines and procedures that local
governments (including Vancouver) employ to variously prevent hazards, check

resilience against fire and emergencies, and protect the health and safety of
residents;
3. In British Columbia, the Province has created guidelines5 to help local
governments meet the needs of tenants who live in unsafe and unhealthy
accommodation due to poor building maintenance, along with remedies,
enforcement and penalties. Some of the caveats in the guide advise that local
Standards of Maintenance bylaws:
a. Must be consistent with current local regulations and municipal bylaws;
b. Cannot exceed standards established by the building code; and
c. Any adoption or modification should seek legal advice from city solicitors;
4. The BC Residential Tenancy Act says landlords must follow local standards of
maintenance bylaws: A landlord must provide and maintain residential property in
a state of decoration and repair that complies with the health, safety and housing
standards required by law6;
In its Residential Tenancy advisory for repairs, maintenance, and dispute
resolution, the provincial agency directs tenants to first “Check with your local
government to learn more about the standards of maintenance in your
community.”;
5. The standards referenced by BC’s Residential Tenancy advisory, Vancouver’s
Standards of Maintenance By-law, while retrievable via the City’s website is not
particularly accessible to the general public in plain language and in the absence
of dedicated renter services staff at the city;
6. In Vancouver, the Vancouver Charter (306, i) allows regulation of building
standards for dwellings in respect of standards of “fitness for human habitation”.
The Standards of Maintenance Bylaw No. 54627 prescribes standards for the
maintenance and occupancy of building sites within the City of Vancouver “to
ensure that such buildings and sites are free from hazard and are maintained
continuously in conformity with accepted health, fire, and building requirements”.
In the context of the Vancouver Charter the by-law implicitly targets residential
buildings;
7. Mould is a fungi typically found where moisture, decay and oxygen are present.
Exposure to mould spores can cause serious and chronic health impacts
including mild to severe allergic reactions, headaches, dizziness, even death.
Mould testing is typically performed by way of visual identification and on-site or
lab testing. The Vancouver Charter (330k) considers regulations for (iv) the
suitability of any such room in respect of dampness or insanitation;

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, April 16, 2025 17
Victoria BC’s Rental Property Standards of Maintenance bylaw8 lists mould as a
hazard, “If a tenant reports mould to the landlord, the landlord must respond in a
timely way and take all reasonable steps to eliminate the mould from all
structures and surfaces of a residential property;” ;
8. Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) is important for residential safety because poor air quality
exposure can lead to a great number of health issues including allergies, asthma,
respiratory infections, fatigue, heart disease, cancer, even death. Air Quality
testing typically looks for chemical, biological or combustion pollutants and can
include exposure to mould, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and other harmful
particulates. Health Canada advises “proper ventilation is a key component of
good indoor air quality”.9 IAQ in residential buildings is not regulated by
Vancouver Coast Health. Vancouver’s Standards of Maintenance Bylaw currently
regulates that mechanical ventilation systems are in working order but to not
regulate systems effectiveness for IAQ. The Vancouver Charter (330k) considers
regulations for (iii) the degree of ventilation, cleanliness, and access of natural
light to be afforded in each room intended to be occupied.
The City of Kitchener Ontario standards of maintenance has a clause on air
quality, advising Interior spaces within a building or structure shall be kept free
from accumulations of air borne contaminants that may pose a health concern to
any person10; and
9. Water damage is not explicitly identified in Vancouver Standards of Maintenance
By-law, which variously otherwise advises pipes in good working order, and not
leaking. Water damage sources may result from leaking pipes, but also weather
events like atmospheric rivers, failure of building envelope, or blockage overflows
from otherwise properly functioning plumbing. Water damage is often evidenced
from warped, bubbled, or sagging interior finishes that often indicate more
serious issues inside the walls that can function as a catalyst for mould, IAQ
problems, and structural damage. Vancouver Charter (330k) considers
regulations for (iv) the suitability of any such room in respect of dampness or
insanitation.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Council direct staff to report back with considerations and amendments to
improve the existing Standards of Maintenance By-law to include references and
remedies for instances of mould, indoor air quality, and water damage.
B. THAT Council direct staff to report back on creating a simpler, more accessible
plain-language delivery of information to advise Vancouver tenants of their rights,
health, safety, and remedies under the Standards of Maintenance By-law on the
