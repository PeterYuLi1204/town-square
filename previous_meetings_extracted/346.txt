the City as Licensor and the selected Zero Waste Technology Providers identified
in Appendix C of the same report, Table C2 (“ZWTPs”) as Licensees, to occupy a
portion of the Site to demonstrate their unique zero waste technology.

the Site totalling approximately $276,000 per year, and $690,000 over the

Demonstration Site Pilot at City Owned Property 1198 East Kent Avenue South”

contributing to the welfare of Vancouver.
E. THAT Council direct staff to report back in late 2025 on the outcomes of the first

2. Endorsing the Transit for Teens Campaign to Extend BC’s Get on Board Program
up to Age 18
The Committee heard from four speakers in support and one speaker who made general
comments of the recommendations.
MOVED by Councillor Boyle
SECONDED by Councillor Carr
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
1. Transit access is a survival lifeline to access shelter, school, support services,
health care, and food security for low-income youth whose families may not have
a vehicle, and the cost of a monthly transit pass for teens can be extremely
challenging for working families already struggling with the high cost of living in
Vancouver;
2. The BC Poverty Reduction Coalition, the Centre for Family Equity (formerly
known as the Single Mothers Alliance), and many others have been advocating
for free transit through the “All On Board” campaign which calls for free transit for
all starting with transit riders from age 0-18 in BC, a sliding scale pass for low-
income adults, and an end to ticketing minors. Vancouver City Council passed a
motion in support of the campaign in 2019;
3. Encouraging students to use public transit can increase their independence and
participation in employment and civic life, and can also help close the equity gap
and reduce poverty. Offering free transit to youth can incentivize a shift away
from car travel, reduce the burden on parents or caregivers to drive their
teenagers around, and build lifelong transit users;
4. In 2021 the BC NDP government made public transit free for all children 12 and
under in every transit system in BC with the introduction of their new “Get on
Board” program, “saving families money, increasing access to affordable
transportation options and encouraging more people to use public transit.”;
5. The City of Vancouver led a Reduced Fare Transit Pilot, thanks to funding from
UBCM, which provided 100 participants with free one-zone TransLink Compass
Card passes for six months from October 2021 to the end of March 2022. The
Centre for Family Equity participated in the pilot, and report that according to the
parents of youth who participated:
a. Transit access opened up the lives of teens and hugely impacted their
ability to access school, after-school programs, volunteering, and social
activities;

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, June 14, 2023 9
b. Teenagers had increased access to services and supports they needed,
particularly for mental health supports;
c. Parents reported that their teens' sense of inclusion, worth, and mental
well-being were visibly affected by the free transit access;
d. The pass also increased teenagers' confidence to explore opportunities
and activities in their community;
6. The City of Vancouver is committed to supporting our youth as well as
addressing equity, diversity and inclusivity.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
THAT the City of Vancouver endorse the Transit for Teens Campaign to raise the age of
eligibility for the Get on Board program up to age 18.
FURTHER THAT Council request that the Mayor write a letter to the Minister of
Transportation and Infrastructure, the Minister of Education and Child Care, the Minister
of Social Development and Poverty Reduction, the Minister of Children and Family
Development, and the Select Standing Committee on Children and Youth, urging them to
work with the provincial government to finalize and secure funding and develop a plan
that will extend the Get on Board program up to age 18 in B.C
amended
AMENDMENT MOVED by Councillor Montague
SECONDED by Councillor Meiszner
THAT the in the THAT clause, the phrase “Transit for Teens Campaign to raise the age of
eligibility for the Get on Board program up to age 18.” be struck and the following be
inserted “position of the Mayors’ Council based on TransLink’s 2018 Fare Policy Review
to urge the Provincial Government to expand the eligibility of the BC Bus Pass program
to all low-income residents, including youth; “;
AND THAT in the FURTHER THAT clause, the phrase “extend the Get on Board
program up to age 18 in B.C.“ be struck and with the following be inserted “expand
transit fare discounts for all low-income residents, including youth, through an improved
BC Bus Pass program.”
CARRIED (Vote No. 09333)
(Councillors Boyle, Carr and Fry opposed, and Councillors Kirby-Yung and Meiszner absent for
the vote.)
The amendment having carried, the motion as amended was put and CARRIED
UNANIMOUSLY (Vote No. 09334) with Councillors Kirby-Yung, Meiszner and Mayor Sim
absent for the vote.

MOVED by Councillor Zhou
SECONDED by Councillor Bligh
THAT the Committee recommend to Council
WHEREAS
1. Vancouver is home to Canada's second largest Filipino community and makes up
the third-largest Asian Canadian and visible minority group behind Chinese and
South Asian Canadians;
2. According to the 2021 census, there are over 174,000 people of Filipino descent
living in British Columbia, most of whom live in the Metro Vancouver area;
3. The Filipino community has made significant contributions to the city of
Vancouver in a wide variety of area including arts and entertainment, sports,
healthcare, and nursing, and have greatly enriched the cultural fabric and cultural
diversity of our city and contributed to the growth and development of its
economy;
4. June is Filipino Heritage Month in Canada which gives us the opportunity to
celebrate Filipino culture, traditions, and languages, as well as the many
contributions this community has made to our city, our province, and our country;

Standing Committee of Council on City Finance and Services
Minutes, Wednesday, June 14, 2023 12
5. British Columbia and Metro Vancouver’s Filipino community have long identified
the need for a Filipino Cultural Center to enable local celebrations and cultural
performances and to help connect Filipinos born in Canada to their heritage and
ensure that younger Filipinos remain connected to their roots;
6. The City of Vancouver has been identified by the Filipino community as a
desirable place to locate a Filipino Cultural Center to serve all of BC’s Filipino
community;
7. In December 2022, Premier David Eby presented mandate letters to his newly-
appointed Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries, including direction to the
Honourable Lana Popham, Minister of Tourism, Arts, Culture and Sport, to
prioritize progress on a number of initiatives including advancing work toward a
