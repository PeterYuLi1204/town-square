MOTIONS
A. Administrative Motions
None.
B. Motions on Notice
1. 2018 Budget Enhancements Pertaining to Littering and Residents’ Safety
MOVED by Councillor Affleck
SECONDED by Councillor De Genova
WHEREAS
1. The mission of the Vancouver Board of Parks and Recreation is to provide,
preserve, and advocate for parks and recreation services to benefit all people,
communities, and the environment;
2. The Vancouver Board of Parks and Recreation (Park Board) is established under
the Vancouver Charter and has possession, jurisdiction and control of all areas
designated as permanent public parks of the City;

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, Tuesday, October 3, 2017 20
3. Section 496 of the Vancouver Charter states that “Every warden, lifeguard,
patrolman, or watchman employed in the parks by the Board shall, while in the
performance of his duties within the parks, be ex officio possessed of all the
powers and authority of a police constable”;
4. In May 2000, The Vancouver Board of Parks and Recreation established the Park
Ranger program in response to a) growing competition for space and the
increased intensity of activity in many public spaces in the downtown, and b)
an expectation on the part of park users that competing interests be
moderated and balanced as part of park stewardship;
5. Since 2000, the Park Ranger program has grown and expanded in scope and
responsibilities: for example, to include by-law enforcement for the ban on
smoking in Vancouver parks as introduced in September 2010;
6. In recent years, the Park Board and its budget have experienced significant
challenges related to drug use and garbage in various Downtown parks, notably
Andy Livingstone Park, Emery Barnes Park, and Stanley Park, and increasingly
at Hinge Park, Creekside Park, and others;
7. Used syringes, in particular, represent an ongoing safety risk in a number of
Vancouver parks, especially for children, and Park Board Commissioners and
Staff, as well as members of Council, have received numerous expressions of
concern from parents and others who frequent Vancouver parks;
8. An estimated 28,000 person-hours were allocated to Park Ranger services in the
2017 Park Board budget, which is the equivalent of 22 FTE Park Ranger
positions to patrol 240 Vancouver parks;
9. Vancouver parks are open from 6:00 am to 10:00 pm daily, and often accessed
and used 24 hours a day, while Park Rangers are typically not on duty after
8:00 pm, which places the burden and cost of by-law enforcement in City parks
on the Vancouver Police Department (VPD) during the overnight hours;
10. The existing Park Board budget for Park Rangers and park maintenance is
inadequate to address the significant challenges related to drug use and
littering in various parks.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT Vancouver City Council direct staff to include, on a priority basis as part
of the 2018 Operating Budget process, additional funding for the Vancouver
Board of Parks and Recreation to enable 24-hour-a-day Park Ranger patrols at
all Vancouver parks impacted by the significant challenges of drug use and
littering, as well as additional funding to maintain the cleanliness and safety of
impacted Vancouver parks on an ongoing basis.

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, Tuesday, October 3, 2017 21
B. THAT Vancouver City Council direct City staff to continue to liaise with their
Park Board staff counterparts to explore ways in which Park Board can assist in
efforts to locate appropriate housing and supports for those struggling with
mental health and addiction challenges.

3. Walk for Reconciliation Commemorations
MOVED by Mayor Robertson
SECONDED by Councillor Reimer
WHEREAS
1. On National Indigenous Peoples Day 2013 the City of Vancouver became the
first city in Canada to proclaim a Year of Reconciliation between indigenous
and non-indigenous peoples;
2. Over the course of the Year of Reconciliation, the City worked together with
the three local First Nations, urban indigenous people and Reconciliation
Canada to undertake many events that had three objectives:
• Make the space for indigenous people to speak the truth about the
harms caused to them by colonization
• Make the space for non-indigenous people to acknowledge that they
have heard these truths
• Find a new pathway forward together;
3. The centerpiece was Canada’s first ever Walk for Reconciliation, which saw
over 70,000 people gather at the plaza adjacent to the QE Theatre (referenced
as "QE Plaza" below) in a torrential September downpour to walk together in
recognition of residential school survivors, and to acknowledge those that did
not survive, after a week of testimony at the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission national event at the PNE grounds;
4. In the interval since 2013, the City has declared itself a City of Reconciliation
and significant work has been done to advance social, economic, environmental
and other policies that recognize the inherent courage, resilience and rights of
indigenous people and help ensure that the local First Nations are once again
visible in their traditional homelands but to date no prominent public space in
downtown Vancouver carries the name or visual identity of the local First
Nations;

Regular Council Meeting
Minutes, Tuesday, October 3, 2017 23
5. 2017 is the 150th anniversary of Confederation and under the banner of "150+"
City Council unanimously committed to significantly advancing reconciliation
this year;
6. As one of the Signature Events for 150+ a 2nd Walk for Reconciliation was held
on September 24, 2017 which again saw tens of thousands of residents gather
together in the “QE Plaza” with reflection and remembrance but also a
celebration of the work that’s been done;
7. The “QE Plaza” also was the home of the Four Host Nations Pavilion during the
2010 Olympics;
8. For decades the Vancouver Art Gallery north plaza has been a central gathering
place for public protests, celebrations, and rallies and a space where
Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples have pushed to make our city
acknowledge its injustices and work towards greater understanding;
9. These two public plazas do not have official names or even consistent informal
names used by the community.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT:
A. The City work with the Musqueam, Squamish and Tsleil-Waututh to find an
appropriate name and a commemoration of the Walks for Reconciliation for the
plaza adjacent to the Queen Elizabeth Theatre in recognition of the significant
role the plaza has played in both historic events.
B. The City work with the Musqueam, Squamish, Tsleil-Waututh and the Province
of BC to determine an appropriate name and an acknowledgement of the three
local First Nations for the Vancouver Art Gallery north plaza, the most utilized
public space in Vancouver, to ensure the work of reconciliation remains visible
to all people present and future in Vancouver.
