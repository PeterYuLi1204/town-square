Council Meeting
Minutes, July 5 and 21, 2022 17
2. Commemorating Muslim Holidays
MOVED by Councillor Swanson
SECONDED by Councillor Boyle
WHEREAS
1. The Muslim community of Vancouver, estimated to be around 70,000, is an
essential part of the Vancouver community, yet has only one of its holidays and
celebrations recognized by the City of Vancouver;
2. The global Muslim community, estimated to be around 1.8 billion, recognizes
three pivotal celebrations that are celebrated by Muslims in over 100 countries
around the world: the month of Ramadan, Eid al-Fitr, and Eid al-Adha;
3. The ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar is the month of Ramadan, a sacred
month to Muslims in Vancouver and across the globe;
4. The month of Ramadan and the surrounding practices are incredibly important to
Muslims, who engage in daily fasting from sunrise to sunset during the month as
one of the Five Pillars of their Faith;
5. The purpose of the month of Ramadan for Muslims is to engage in a month of
spiritual reflection, self-discipline, and cultivate empathy for the less fortunate and
build community;
6. The month of Ramadan connects the Muslim community to the other major
Abrahamic faiths, as it is believed by Muslims that all holy texts including the
Torah and Gospels were revealed during the month of Ramadan;
7. Vancouver is proud of its diverse community representing many different
traditions and faiths, which is connected to the spirit of Ramadan;
8. On April 1, 2022 the Prime Minister of Canada released a statement
acknowledging Ramadan as both a special time to “reflect on values of peace,
compassion, and generosity” and “an opportunity to recognize the many
contributions that Muslim Canadians make and have made to the country,”
(https://pm.gc.ca/en/news/statements/2022/04/01/statement-prime-minister-
ramadan);
9. The two days following the month of Ramadan are a traditional holiday for the
Muslim community called Eid al-Fitr, celebrated globally;
10. The tenth day of the twelfth month of the Islamic calendar marks the beginning of
Eid al-Adha, another incredibly important celebration for the global Muslim
community that celebrates the story of the Abrahamic prophets Abraham and
Ishmael;

Council Meeting
Minutes, July 5 and 21, 2022 18
11. Eid al-Adha also connects Muslims to the other major Abrahamic faiths, as it is
the celebration of a pivotal Biblical story;
12. Eid al-Adha is already recognized by the city, but neither Ramadan nor Eid al-Fitr
are;
13. While the city already commemorates a Day of Action Against Islamophobia, this
is done to memorialize and commit to act against a heinous crime committed
against the Muslim community in Canada and is not a celebration; but rather, the
bare minimum to stand against a hate crime;
14. Despite this, hate crimes against Muslims continue to increase yearly, with
Islamophobia being a greater problem as time goes by;
15. When the Muslim community faces increasing Islamophobia, the recognition of
the Muslim community and its celebrations by the City will be a strong show of
support towards it;
16. The recognition of festivals connecting the Muslim community with other faiths
represented in Vancouver is a powerful opportunity to bring the Vancouver
community together in dialogue;
17. Canada as a whole recognizes countless days rooted in the dominant Christian
tradition such as Christmas, Easter, Sundays as weekends, etc. Marginalized
groups still see only a handful of their days commemorated;
18. Recognizing one marginalized group’s commemorations is a win for all
marginalized groups, that elevates all marginalized peoples and shows respect
for them; and
19. Seeing Muslim celebrations recognized may inspire other groups to pursue
having their commemorations recognized, and continues to establish precedents
for marginalized groups being acknowledged by the city.
THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED
A. THAT the City of Vancouver add the month of Ramadan, Eid al-Fitr, and
Eid al-Adha, to its official celebrations and observations calendar.
B. THAT the City acknowledge Ramadan on its social media and website.
C. THAT the City investigates the possibility of co-hosting a yearly iftar dinner once
during the month of Ramadan at sunset, collaborating with the local Muslim
community, and in the Ramadan spirit of inclusivity and community, also invite
groups and leaders representing other major faiths and First Nations.
D. THAT the City use the month of Ramadan to highlight the work being done by
Muslim charities and the Muslim community in the city.

ENQUIRIES AND OTHER MATTERS
1. Opening Hours and Staffing at City Facilities
Councillor Wiebe noted that some City facilities were not operating at the same hours and
staffing capacity as they were prior to Covid-19, and enquired as to when they would reach
pre-Covid-19 hours and capacity. The City Manager agreed to provide a response.
2. Main and Hastings Area
Councillor Bligh noted there have been notable changes in service delivery around the area of
Main Street and Hastings Street and concerns are being raised in the community. She enquired
where the City is actively working to create a better balance in the area. The City Manager
provided a response noting that in the past few weeks there has been a reduced presence of
VPD in the area due to their demands and that there is also decreased compliance from
individuals when staff from Engineering Services have requested streets to be cleared; the
result of both these factors is a problem with sidewalks and sanitation. He noted staff are
looking for solutions and working with people on the streets and their advocates to ensure the
streets are clean and accessible and highlighted that Engineering Services has not stepped
away, it is a matter of compliance, and it is being addressed, as the area is not safe, accessible
or healthy. The City Manager advised staff are currently working on providing information to the
public about this matter.
