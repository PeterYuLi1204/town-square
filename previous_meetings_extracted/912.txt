Iain Dixon, Assistant Director – Regulatory Litigation, Legal Department, was present on behalf
of the City of Vancouver. Raymond Robb (the “Licencee”), along with his wife and host of the
Short-Term Rental (STR), Stephanie Robb, were present and represented themselves.
Mr. Dixon noted that these three Short-Term Rental (STR) licence appeals on today’s Agenda
are the first to come to a Business Licence Hearing since the inclusion of Short-Term Rentals in
the License By-law (No. 4450). Mr. Dixon provided an overview of the proceedings and noted
that the purpose of the Panel is to rule on whether the appellants’ Licences were suspended
correctly under the related by-laws. Mr. Dixon also noted that the Panel may not make
exemptions to the by-law itself, as they are bound to the by-laws as approved by Council.
Sarah Hicks, Deputy Chief Licence Inspector, was present as witness on behalf of the City.
Mr. Dixon reviewed the Evidence Brief and asked clarifying questions of Ms. Hicks.
Panel members and the licencee asked clarifying questions of Ms. Hicks.
Mr. Robb provided opening remarks and provided a Rebuttal package (on file in the City Clerk’s
Office), and claimed that Mr. Dixon presented inaccurate information about the ability of the
Panel to overturn a business licence suspension.
Mr. Dixon rebutted Mr. Robb’s remarks as he felt Mr. Robb’s comments impugned his character.
Mr. Dixon then clarified that he had accurately relayed to Mr. Robb the Panel’s role at Business
Licence Hearings.
The Licencee called Stephanie Robb as witness; Mrs. Robb provided her comments and the
licencee provided additional comments.
Panel members asked clarifying questions of Mr. and Mrs. Robb.
Mr. Dixon provided closing comments, reminding the Panel that their role is to determine if the
unit is allowable as an STR under the current by-laws, which it is not, and therefore Ms. Hicks’
decision to suspend the licence should be upheld.
The Licencee provided closing comments, noting that the panel should be able to make
exceptions to the by-law.
PANEL MEMBERS DISCUSSION
Panel members made closing comments, noting that they are sensitive to individual
circumstances, but are restricted to the current by-laws. Panel members also noted that such
circumstances may be worthwhile considerations for future STR discussions, and have now
been brought to the attention of staff.

Iain Dixon, Assistant Director – Regulatory Litigation, Legal Department, was present on behalf
of the City of Vancouver. Jan Koncewicz (the “Licencee”), was present and represented himself.

Mr. Dixon reviewed the Evidence Brief and asked clarifying questions of Ms. Hicks.
Mr. Koncewicz provided opening comments and additional documentation to the Panel (on file

ruling on the issue with his strata; Mr. Koncewicz informed he was not sure.
Mr. Dixon provided closing comments noting that the by-law is written so that permission from
the strata is required in order to operate an STR, and until that authorization is received,
Ms. Hicks’ decision to suspend the licence should be upheld.

Iain Dixon, Assistant Director – Regulatory Litigation, Legal Department, was present on behalf
of the City of Vancouver. Hamin Reza Hourvash (the “Licencee”), was present and represented
himself.
Mr. Dixon provided opening comments, noting the location of the unit is zoned as commercial
and therefore not eligible to be used for the purpose of a Short-Term Rental (STR).
Sarah Hicks, Deputy Chief Licence Inspector, was present as witness on behalf of the City.
Mr. Dixon reviewed the Evidence Brief and asked clarifying questions of Ms. Hicks.
Mr. Hourvash asked the witness why his Business Licence was approved in the first place if it
was deemed an illegal dwelling unit.
Ms. Hicks clarified that the application was a self-declaration process, and the applicant
declared the unit as a lawful dwelling unit on the application.
Mr. Hourvash provided opening comments and summarized his situation.
Councillor Fry asked questions of the licencee and further clarified the role of the Panel, noting
that the issue seems to lie with how Mr. Houvash’s landlord represented the unit.
Mr. Dixon waived closing comments.
Mr. Hourvash provided closing comments, noting he would like to receive compensation until
the issue is resolved and defer the suspension of the STR to not disappoint guests that have
reserved the STR.

PANEL MEMBERS DISCUSSION
Councillor Fry reiterated that the City is not in position to provide compensation.
Councillor Hardwick noted that the address is not currently listed as residential, and perhaps in
the future, if relevant permits are obtained, Mr. Hourvash may then be able to re-apply for a
STR business licence.
Following discussion, it was,
MOVED by Councillor Fry
SECONDED by Councillor Hardwick
THAT the recommendation by the Deputy Chief Licence Inspector to suspend the
Business Licence issued to Hamin Hourvash (the “Licencee”) for the purposes of a
Short-Term Rental Accommodation at 8833 Selkirk Street Unit 200, be upheld on the
basis that:
• the Licencee is in contravention of section 11.32.2 of the Zoning & Development
By-law which states “Short Term Rental Accommodation is only permitted in a
lawful dwelling unit, secondary suite, laneway house, or lock-off unit that is a
principal residence unit”, as 8833 Selkirk Street Unit 200 is not a valid address
nor a lawful dwelling unit.
